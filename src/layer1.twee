!Layer 1 - Arcadia's Garden
@@Stepping across the sparse grasses, eyes occasionally catching on some flowers that are much more vulvic than any you've seen before, or perhaps a rock formation that seems far too phallic to be natural, you proceed down the relatively tranquil first layer of the Abyss. The town already begins to disappear from view above you, and below you is nothing but gentle, lush slopes leading further into the dark.

Traveling back to the surface from here will take 1 day, and will cost 10 corruption. Leaving the Abyss also requires that you don't have any negative corruption points, even if you plan to come back.

You spot an unusual caterpillar as it crawls up a tree. Its peculiar shape resembles a detached human phallus, but instead of soft hair, menacing spines cover its body. The sight is unsettling, and you can't help but shudder at the thought of anyone putting this creature near their most intimate areas.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 2>>
In the distance you can hear some people yelling about something, but you can't quite make it out. When you get a bit closer, you can't seem to find any people, but you do see some spare clothes on the ground and some rustling in the bush nearby. Rather than waiting for the people to return, you choose to move on.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 3>>
Near the top of the layer, you notice a completely normal woman carrying a full pack trying to approach the surface, but she seems to be having a great difficulty moving forward. "Why can't I just leave?" She calls out in exasperation to no one in particular. It seems the Abyss itself is impeding her, so you couldn't help her even if you tried.<br><br>

<<say $companionSaeko>>This isn't a tree stump, you know. It's a fungus that's taken the shape of a dead tree – a fascinating example of mimicry.<</say>><br>
She digs into the earth near the stump's base, revealing a gray texture oozing a creamy white substance.
<br><br>
<<say $companionSaeko>>I wonder what purpose this serves? The ecology here is so bizarre, despite its proximity to the surface...<</say>><br>

@@.floatr;[img[setup.ImagePath+'icon.png']]@@

This layer is pretty tame, and besides the Miasma, threats from the Abyss itself are rare here.
<br><br>
A @@color:red;red@@ background indicates that something is not a choice for you to make, but rather a threat that needs to be addressed during your time in that layer. You can't skim past them and ignore them; they're a challenge you need to face whether you like it or not. They'll automatically appear when you fulfil the conditions for them.
<br><br>
All of the balloons available in the shop are safeguarded against threats like these, and you won't need to worry about them being intercepted during their ascent.

<h1>Relics</h1>

<p>
@@.floatr;[img[setup.ImagePath+'icon.png']]@@

If there were ever any powerful, versatile, noteworthy Relics to be found in such an early layer, they were likely claimed by someone else by now. Of course, almost any Relic can be useful under the right circumstances or with some lateral thinking &mdash; these are just a bit harder to find applications for than the rarer Relics you can find deeper in.
<br><br>
Some Relics may be particularly well-hidden or require significant detours, causing them to incur a day cost in the search for them, in addition to the standard corruption cost.
<br><br>
Certain Relics possess straightforward uses that become readily apparent in specific circumstances, while others might demand a touch of ingenuity. If a Relic has an explicit gameplay function, it will bear a ☸ symbol. Seeing this symbol indicates that the Relic has a predetermined use coded within the game. However, even without this symbol, a Relic can still prove valuable - it's up to you to discover its potential and apply it creatively!

<h1>Curses</h1>
<p>
@@.floatr;[img[setup.ImagePath+'icon.png']]@@

At such an early area of the Abyss, the Curses you may be afflicted with here are relatively light and non-intrusive, and many may simply be blessings in disguise. Still, I recommend that you don't use the corruption you obtain here carelessly! Later Curses won't be quite so forgiving, and you might want to carefully decide whether to take lots of Relics early on or save your corruption for later.
<br><br>
If a Curse has '(max x)' in its description, that means you can take it up to x times, multiplying the corruption points and its original effect by that number. All other Curse options can only be taken once. Curses describing multiple levels will have their level increased by taking similar Curses on multiple layers, but the Curse specifically named 'Libido Reinforcement A' can only be taken once, for example. You don't to take them in order, i.e. B without A is fine.

:: Layer1 Forage [cards layer1 nobr]

<h1>Foraging</h1>

<p>If you want to be economical, you can rely on food and water scavenged from the Abyss rather than, or in addition to, the rations you can buy in Outset Town. However, being so thoroughly infused in Miasma typically causes the flora and fauna of the Abyss to induce effects similar to Curses when ingested, and drinking water is much the same. With the help of the Encyclopedia Abyssia, you can often find ways to consume things in the Abyss safely, or at least minimize the danger - but the effects only become harsher the deeper you go, and at a certain point there's simply no reliable information to even put in the Encyclopedia, rendering it obsolete. The simple act of collecting food or water to begin with may be difficult, as well. Rations are certainly safer, if you can afford the price and have the room to carry them.</p>

<p>Remember, food gathered in one layer will spoil near-instantly after moving to another, so you can't just stock up on one kind of foraged food and use that for your whole journey. Water has no such limitation, though you will need the flasks sold in Outset Town to contain it.</p>

<p>If you decide to start foraging for food or water, it means that you will not consume your stored food rations or water supply while consuming time on tasks in this layer, but you will not obtain more supplies by starting to forage here.</p>

<p>You can also choose to consume some extra food or water if you <i>want</i> the side effects of the miasma. It may seem a bit odd, but I won't judge! This won't prevent you from getting hungry or thirsty on future days though. It's purely for you to use if you want to consume a bit of extra miasma on your journey.</p>

:: Layer1 Forage Convo

You and Maru meander through the verdant, rolling glades of the upper Abyss, keeping an eye out for something edible to prepare for your meals.

<<say $mc>>I think the mushrooms around here are edible. I spotted some earlier, so we can go back to get them.<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>>Do you remember any specific landmarks?<</say>>
<<say $mc>>There was a large cave in one of the cliffs, but that describes a lot of the area around here.<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>>Oh, actually, I do remember an especially big cave over here, maybe it's that one?<</say>>
Maru points towards a certain cliff and begins walking, his carefree, light steps exuding an infectious charm.

Arriving at your destination, you find that Maru's memory was spot on – there's a large cave. In fact, it's spacious enough to house a Kite Dragon. One skitters out of the entrance before taking to the air, its massive dragonfly-like wings beating rapidly. As its body shifts, an overwhelming chittering sound emits from its bright red chitin exoskeleton, but fortunately, the creature seems to pay you no mind as it leaves.

<<say $companionMaru>>I'm really glad those things are herbivores.<</say>>
Maru then smiles and points excitedly at a softly glowing purple lump at the edge of the cave.

<<say $companionMaru>>You were right, there are mushrooms here!<</say>>
He moves swiftly yet gracefully to collect a number of mushrooms, enough to feed your party. <<if $abyssKnow === 1>>However, you notice he's taking the ones that are releasing spores, evident by the slight pink dust coming off of them. Before he can add those to his collection, you stop him. It's best to avoid those due to their side effects, and with your help, you pick out only the healthiest of Blisshrooms.<</if>>

<<say $companionMaru>>Alright! I think I have an idea for what we can make with these when we get back to camp.<</say>>
You hike back towards camp, glancing back at the cave, a hint of apprehension that perhaps the giant creature might not take kindly to your trespassing. But fortunately, any anxiety is unfounded, and you walk out of sight of the cave with no disruptions, just a pleasant stroll through the bountiful nature of the first layer of the Abyss. But before you make it back to camp, Maru stops you and silently places a finger over his mouth, shushing you.

<<say $companionMaru>>Do you hear that? I think another great ingredient is nearby.<</say>>
You can make out a soft buzzing coming from off in the distance. Maru smiles and points in the direction of the sound.

<<say $companionMaru>>I think we might be able to get some honey. I've heard there are a few colonies of bees around here, and their honey is especially sweet! It isn't really nutritious, so we can't live off of it, but it should make these mushrooms taste much better! I also don't think the bees sting people, but we can be careful just in case.<</say>>
Maru starts walking once again and gestures for you to follow him. After a few minutes, the buzzing has increased to a level that almost drowns out conversation, and bees are regularly flying around you. Thankfully, none has stung either of you yet. Maru appears calm as he approaches a phallic-shaped hive and gathers a bit of the honey that seems to be leaking out of the tip, and the bees pay him no mind as he does so.

Maru quickly makes off with the honey, and you follow him, eager to escape an area where you might accidentally breathe in an Abyssal bee. He smiles at you and shows you the haul from the trip.

<<say $companionMaru>>I think I got enough to flavor the meal! I hope this turns out really tasty!<</say>>
After some more hiking, you finally make it back to the camp, where you can enjoy the fruits of your labor. <<if $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.id === setup.companionIds.khemia)>>But when you arrive back at camp, you notice that Khemia is furious.

<<say $companionKhemia>>What were you doing? You two shouldn't go off on your own like that without me. Even though this is only the first layer, there are bandits here! How am I supposed to do my job and protect you if you wander off without me?<</say>>
He seems to be projecting a cold fury and a hint of fear, quite unlike his typical casual confidence.

<<say $companionMaru>>I'm really sorry, Khemia. We should have let you know. Next time we'll let you come with us.<</say>>
You agree and echo the apology. Khemia doesn't quite seem satisfied, but he lets it go and eyes your haul.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It was okay this time, and those do look tasty. But the Abyss kills people every day who don't take it seriously. I don't want that to happen to anyone I'm traveling with again.<</say>>
There's a moment of silence as Khemia takes a chance to check around the camp for any threats. Maru sighs, but then picks up the ingredients and smiles.<</if>>

<<say $companionMaru>>Now is my favorite part, time to get cooking!<</say>>
Maru expertly starts a small fire and coats the mushrooms in a thin layer of honey, making sure to fill some of the small openings in the mushroom to let the flavor soak in. He then pierces them with sticks and seems to measure them at a precise height above the fire, giving the impression he has experience with cooking these. After a few minutes, he takes a bite of one and smiles, then hands another stick to you.

<<say $companionMaru>>It's done! And they turned out really well too!<</say>>
As you take a bite of the morsel, the taste is surprisingly unlike any mushrooms you've had before. It tastes more like a strawberry dessert with honey flavor rather than the savory taste you expected. But they also have a very faint spicy aftertaste, giving the dish just a little bit of a punch.

<<say $mc>>These taste great, thanks for doing the cooking, Maru.<</say>>
Maru beams at you and takes another bite of his own dish.

<<say $companionMaru>>Thanks! Cooking is one of my favorite things to do and one of the few things that's actually useful down here, so I'm really glad you enjoy it.<</say>>
You sit by the fire with your party and chat, the mood is pretty upbeat and optimistic.

Apart from Relics, you may also find stationary Wonders hidden away throughout the Abyss. These generally have positive effects and may help you on your expedition, though they sometimes come with a cost.

Unlike Relics, their effects come from a complex interaction between them and the Miasma around them, so attempts to move them around and make use of them elsewhere would prove fruitless. They're only useful when left where they are.

As you meander through the lush, verdant slopes of the first layer of the Abyss, your eyes catch a glint of something unusual, and you are drawn to a small clearing where the captivating figure of the Icon of Mercy stands. Awestruck, you approach the statue, taking in the exquisite craftsmanship and the elegant lines of her flowing dress. Her exposed breast seems to represent vulnerability and nurturing, and the feeling of comfort emanating from the statue is palpable.

The maiden's hands are extended gently, offering an invitation to touch them. As you hesitantly reach out and make contact with the cool, smooth marble, you feel a surge of warmth spreading through your body. \

However, it's not nearly as strong as the first time. You won't be able to remove any more Curses.
<<elseif $mc.curses.length === 0>>\
If you were plagued by a Curse, the Icon of Mercy could offer relief. Until then, there is nothing for you to do here.
<<else>>\
It's as if the Icon of Mercy is acknowledging the weight of your choices and offering you a chance for redemption.

A sudden realization dawns upon you: by touching the statue, you can remove one Curse that has plagued you, but the power it bestowed upon you will also vanish. The decision is yours alone to make, as the Icon of Mercy will have no effect on your companions and can only be used once per person.

:: Pick up the Star Compass [layer1]
<<CollectRelic $relic1>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

The journey to this Relic takes you over undulating hills covered in grasses which sway gently in the wind. Night falls, but you press onwards, knowing that you're almost at your destination. It's peaceful out here, and the stars are out, giving you just enough light to keep moving.

You crest a hill and behold a marvelous sight. In the plains before you is a ring of stones, glowing with a faint blue light. A miasmal fog seems to have settled over the field, but you proceed forward, drawn in by the beauty. This ring of stones doesn't look man-made; it seems like rocks were pulled upward from beneath the ground in 8 evenly spaced ridges, reaching towards the heavens. Those ridges of stone seem like they're glowing with the same twinkling light as the stars, but the ridges crest and then cut off as you move into the center of the ring.

Hovering in the air in the exact center of the ring is a transparent orb containing a shining metal pointing towards the ground, it's the Relic, it has to be. You slowly step forward and gently take it in your hands. The miasmal fog has seeped into you, but the device you've obtained is profoundly beautiful, and seems to work perfectly as a compass. Your spine is tingling with the beauty of the shifting mists and the glowing stones. You look upwards at the stars, and wonder at the turn your life has taken.

<b>This may not be very useful in most circumstances, but perhaps at some point in the depths of the Abyss knowing which direction is down may end up being pretty useful.</b>

:: Pick up the Rømer Stones [layer1]
<<CollectRelic $relic2>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

The Relic you're looking for is in the deeper parts of the layer. The rain from countless clouds runs down in tributaries, and eventually into rivers. Down this far there are many ponds and lakes that slowly flow into rivers and then deeper into the next layer of the Abyss. Some denser vegetation and lots of fungi slow your progress, but they make the journey quite beautiful.

You walk alongside a couple ponds, pushing your way through reeds, and eventually you come to a steaming pool with clear, pristine water. You dip a finger into it, and the water isn't hot, just warmer than the surrounding air. You peer into the depths of the pool, and can make out a few stones clumped together in a crevice at the bottom that look out of place.

You glance around for a few minutes then sigh, and dive into the steaming pond. It actually feels pretty nice, and the water isn't more than 2 meters deep. You swim down to those rocks in the crevice, and start fishing them out, one at a time. Each one you grab starts out slightly hot to the touch and glowing a warm orange, but as you pull it away from its companions it rapidly cools, its glow shifting to a soft cool blue. When you set the first one on the bank, it's not as cold as holding a lump of ice, but the contrast between the cold stone and the warm water in the pool is striking. By the time you reach the last one, it's already cold and glowing blue, and you can feel the water in the pool starting to cool off.

Somewhere along the way with all those dives, you lost some corruption points, but now you've got 5 Rømer Stones, which are pretty nifty and likely practical in hot and cold environments. You look back sadly at the small pond that's no longer steaming near as much as it was. You feel like you've destroyed a small natural wonder of the Abyss, but you promise yourself that you'll put the stones to good use.

<b>While they aren't useful on their own, perhaps you can take these stones back to the Relic Workshop on the surface and make something useful with them?</b>

<<if $mc.appAge > 13>><<if $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.id === setup.companionIds.maru)>>
As you and Maru search for an interesting doll you've heard about, you come across the decaying husk of a house. It looks as if someone once lived here, but it has been long since abandoned to be degraded by the forces of the Abyss.

You enter the ruined home, and after exploring each of the rooms, you happen to come across a perfectly preserved tea table, with a strange looking doll sitting in a chair. Maru notices your discovery, but looks worried and comments, "Why isn't the table rotting? I feel like something's wrong here..." his voice trails off, letting the comment hang for a moment more than you're both comfortable with.

You try to comfort Maru, but he insists he isn't afraid of the doll. "It reminds me of something I used to play with, I think. But it can't be..." At the same time, you get sense that it is almost exactly like a doll you had as a child, except you know you definitely didn't have a doll like this one. It fits right into the uncanny zone of feeling familiar, yet intensely alien in a way that makes you feel strong discomfort just from looking at it.

"I don't think we should take it." Maru crosses his arms, but after a few more words of encouragement from you, he accepts your decision. It can't really cause many problems, it's just a doll, right?

Recognizing the doll's mysterious properties and potential value, you overcome your aversion and take it with you. As you pick it up, you catch a glimpse of the doll smiling, but when you look at it more closely you can tell that its sewn mouth is as static as it ever was.

:: Pick up the Giddy Reaper [layer1]
<<CollectRelic $relic4>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

The gradual slopes and sweeping grasslands of this layer of the Abyss are occasionally broken up by small streams and clumps of more robust vegetation. Your quest for this latest Relic sends you across the landscape until you reach a particularly verdant thicket. No paths exist through it, but many shrieks and squawks from birds inhabiting the many branches of the short trees here greet you as you find a space between trees and slowly make your way inside.

Mottled light peeks through the overhanging branches, and the underbrush is quite thick, but you force your way onward anyway. You weave around spider webs, push aside smaller branches, and pay no heed to the insects on the underbrush. Still, in spite of your determination, you can't help but marvel at the ecology of this place. You count five different types of vines that have alternately wrapped around the trunks and branches of the encompassing trees, or draped across parts of the underbrush, rendering your progress even more difficult, but also interesting. Alternating scents of sweet vegetation, floral delicacy, and musty decomposition waft around you as you keep making slow and steady progress.

Eventually, you come to deeper shadows, the ground feels slightly more moist beneath your feet, and you think there must be a naturally occurring spring somewhere around here. The trees have gotten a bit taller, and the vegetation is more sparse. Fallen leaves take up most of the space on the ground beneath you, but there are a few small herbs peaking through and living off of the small amount of sunlight which pierces the canopy.

Heading forward, your eyes rest upon a tree that is not like the others, with a gleaming, colorful sickle hanging from the trunk, its tip buried in the bark. Your eyes flick back to the tree in awe. The lower trunk is gnarled and massive, it would take at least three people to wrap their arms around it, and it is surely centuries, if not millennia old, but the further up your eyes track, the more confused you get. The bark becomes a complex amalgam of different patterns and textures, as if many types of tree were melded together light play dough. Each limb of the tree looks like it was grafted onto it from a different species. Some of the branches are clearly ancient, others are flush with young growth. All these different species seem to have melded together with the host tree, though you cannot fathom what is really going on here. 

Your attention turns back towards the sickle. There are different sheens of rainbow colors along its curved blade and a solid matte-black handle. You gently tug it free from the tree where it was embedded. But when you grab it, nothing happens. You look down at your prize and see a faint shimmering within the metal on what is clearly an exceedingly sharp blade. A sensation comes over you, like something draining out of you, and you know that the Abyss has taken its toll for the acquisition of this Relic.

On the way back, you decide to test your prize, and you swipe it through some of the brush obstructing your path. The severed branches and leaves fall away with little resistance, but then something remarkable happens, that same glimmering you saw on the blade of the sickle starts shining from the severed tips, and you can actually see new growth swelling from the location of the cuts. You stare at the sight with your mouth agape for a couple moments, and in that time a centimeter of new growth has emerged from one of the cut sites. You can see a faint line where the cut site had been, but the new growth has moved well past it. The Relic you've taken is powerful indeed, at least if you want to cut plants and make them regrow quickly.

<b>This Relic could probably be used to cut things, if you don't already have a sword or other cutting implement.</b>

:: Pick up the Silk Twister [layer1]
<<CollectRelic $relic5>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

You set out after a Relic that's a bit higher up in a nearby canyon. The vegetation along your path isn't too thick, but you soon find yourself traveling along a small river. Miasma laden mist clings to the surface of the water, thrown up by small rapids. There are some large trees along the watercourse, and above it are flocks of birds that are either native to this layer of the Abyss, or that have flown down here. Your path takes you up a tributary into the river, and you move through dappled light from a low canopy.

Ahead you hear a waterfall before you see it, and once you get a clear view of it between the parting tree trunks you marvel at its beauty. The light diffracts off the cloudpool-fed water as it falls down a cliff face. Little rainbows glimmer over the scene. You can barely see the faint outline of a cave mouth behind the translucent curtain of water. You carefully make your way around the loose stones that have fallen from the cliff face over time, pushing through the mists that seem to be offering you faint resistance, and find an ornate comb lying flat on a level rock at the entrance to the shallow cave.

You pick up the comb, and feel the miasmal mists about your feet leeching corruption from you as you do. You're not quite sure how to use this comb to actually increase your chances of survival, but as a cosmetic tool, it's certainly useful. And you could at least sell it to fund further expeditions, it's such to fetch a decent price at the very least.

However, those musings are driven from your thoughts as you walk out from behind the waterfall and see one of the most majestic sights on this layer. A kite dragon soars overhead, its crimson carapace glitters in the light. Its insectile wings blur, despite its enormous size. Thirty meters long, it somehow manages to be agile and graceful, a flock of birds breaks up, greatly diminished, from the kite dragon's passage.

The creature has no interest in preying upon things that do not fly, an odd peculiarity of behavior, but one that lets you admire the enormous beast safely as its long tail trails through the canyon behind it.

:: Pick up the Vertebra Key [layer1]
<<CollectRelic $relic6>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

The Relic you're pursuing takes you off the beaten path. You leave the plains and rivers behind, climbing down a rocky ravine. You struggle as you climb down narrow ledges, large boulders, and dusty rocks. Everything is dry here, compared to the verdant sanctuary that is the rest of the layer.

Eventually, you reach the bottom of the canyon, and there's a rectangular hole cut into the end of the canyon wall, proceeding down dark steps. It feels like a bad idea to enter into that dark tunnel, but you decide to do so anyway.

No sooner have you passed the threshold than a metal grate clanks down behind you. You turn around alarmed, trying to raise the grate, but somehow it is locked shut. You spot a small keyhole near the base of it, but it does you no good without a key, you're stuck. Since you're in this predicament, you might as well explore the tunnel, maybe there's another way out.

You feel your way through the dark passage, but not long after you start to feel things rattling around by your feet. They're inanimate, and at first you think they must be small branches, but they don't quite feel like that. As your foot jars another loose, the unmistakable sound of it raises the hairs on your neck. These are bones. Lots of bones. Bones of previous fools who got themselves trapped in this place? That's what you're afraid of, but you can't be sure of that. You don't even know if they're human bones after all.

You gulp but press onward for what feels like an age. With nervous, careful steps you travel down that passage, until you see a faint grey light up ahead. At first you're excited, a way out? But no, ahead is just a circular room, lit faintly through some crevices in the ceiling, which must be reflecting down some trickle of light from the surface. There is no other way in or out.

In most circumstances you'd call the gloom of the chamber pitch black, but your eyes have dilated so much in this dark hallway that even this faint light lets you see the circular room relatively clearly. In the center is a plinth, and on the plinth is a strange device. At first you think it's just more bones, and perhaps it is, but it's also some kind of key. A key! You grab it, and carefully make your way back to the grate. You fit the key into the lock, and nothing happens.

It doesn't unlock. You're stuck here, stuck to die in this trap. You realize that this place is effectively a cell, not just any cell though, your cell.

Something clicks in your brain, and you have a sudden instinct. This is your cell, you're the only living thing in it. You try the key again, and the latch turns. You're able to lift the metal bars blocking the way, and you exit that unnerving place. After a difficult climb back out of the canyon, you hold the key aloft. It is a grizzly device, but you expect it could be handy.

:: Pick up the Chain of Lorelei [layer1]
<<CollectRelic $relic7>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

Long-term erosion is evident throughout this layer of the Abyss. Yet in every landscape, some things resist erosion better than others. To the southeast there is a butte that rises well above the surrounding landscape. You journey towards it. Far to the north you can see a crimson kite dragon briefly arc above the horizon before gliding back down below it.

Grasses with wide leaves ripple in a light wind upon the lower slopes of the butte, but cliffs rise up in parts, and the flat peak looks like it's going to be pretty stony. There are a few different navigable paths up it, and you choose one that carries you past cliffs with what appear to be cave paintings on them. The scenes are all erotic in their subject matter, and you're not entirely surprised.

You're panting heavily when you reach the top, the wind has blown your hair into quite a mess, but now that you're on level ground again, you can admire the scenery for tens of kilometers around you.

Not very high above you and a little ways off you can see a cloud forming in the influence of the miasma of the Abyss. You didn't come here to admire the scenery however, and you are drawn back to your task.

You walk to the eastern edge of the butte, and find the rock has eroded away from a series of tougher boulders that now jutt out from the ground. You climb up on them, and on a flat-topped boulder you find a chain. You pick it up, and feel corruption draining away from you. This must be the Relic.

You're about to leave when an impulse strikes you. You wrap the chain around your neck and sing. The notes that come out of your throat are beautiful, the melody you are creating on a whim brings tears to your eyes, and gets carried aloft on the wind out over that vast landscape.

After a brief pause you unwrap the chain from your throat. You set off down the butte. That voice was beautiful, but it wasn't yours. Maybe it's just your imagination, but you think you hear a whispered echo on the wind replying to your thoughts. "It isn't yours, but it could be."

<b>You can wear this Relic to change your voice, which may influence how some people perceive you, making you seem more feminine if you'd prefer that.</b>

:: Pick up the Hive Tassel [layer1]
<<CollectRelic $relic8>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

As you wander through a grove of trees in search of the mysterious tassel that's somehow connected to the bees, you notice something new. A constant buzzing surrounds you all at once, as if you were swallowed by a swarm of bees. And in fact, when you glance at the trees, you can see that their bark is now impossible to make out, instead covered in layers of yellow and black insects moving over each other.

Then they begin to take flight, filling the air with black and yellow bugs and filling your ears with an intense droning sound.

As you<<if $hiredCompanions.length > 0>> and your companions<</if>> brace for the pain of the piercing stingers and nearly panic, you realize none of the bees are hurting you. In fact, none seem to be landing on you at all, leaving you a space of about a meter of peace within the ordered chaos of the swarm.

The strange sight in front of you also gives you the chance to notice a few odd things. Firstly, the bees seem strangely proportioned, as if their heads were too big for their bodies, making them almost look like a different type of insect altogether if it weren't for their coloration and behavior. Second, the apparent bees are not moving randomly, they seem to be pairing up and rubbing their bodies quite vigorously against each other before leaving and moving to a new partner. It occurs to you that perhaps you're in the middle of an orgy for these pseudo-bees. Third, you hear a second buzzing sound, one that sounds less like the buzzing of a bee and more like someone hitting wood together very quickly.

As you investigate the new sound, you spot a tree with a few branches vibrating and smacking against each other, with the apparent culprit being a small scrap of cloth gently wrapped around one of the branches. Spotting your goal, you're easily able to pull the vibrating tassel away from the tree, and as you leave the copulating swarm, the tassel becomes still, leaving only the strong smell of honey and its honeycomb pattern to signify there's anything unusual about it.

:: Pick up the Smitten Mitt [layer1]
<<CollectRelic $relic9>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

There are many beautiful things in this layer of the Abyss, but also lots of places that are slightly monotonous. Your Relic expedition sets you out through vast grasslands. In places the grasses are sparse and intermixed with other types of vegetation. In other places they rise high, thick, and dominant.

It's a long walk, and you're almost in a trance-like state in the tedious walking when something changes. The grasses around you stop impeding your way, but seem to be in closer contact with you. It's a very peculiar situation. You can move through them easily, but they're also all over you.

When you look closely, you can see that the leaves from all around you are extending in your direction, the grass stalks bent like they're magnetically attracted to you. You think it's odd that you're not unnerved by this. Yet, you get a sense from the experience that's comforting. It's like all these grasses are reaching you to you and saying: "You're alive, so are we, and as life calls to life, we love you. You'll get through this, and things will be okay."

It's amazing that a simple touch can convey so much. Yet, as the leaves gently rub against you as you walk on, that's how it feels. After a short while longer, the grasses in front of you pull away, forming a circle of retreating stalks surrounding a piece of adorned fabric. You pick it up, and feel the Abyss taking its due, draining corruption from you.

You realize the fabric is in fact some kind of long glove. You stick your hand in, and feel that same sensation you got from the grasses. For a little while longer you continue on, the grasses and the glove both comforting you as you walk. Then the radius of the comforting grasses fades, and at least for the moment, you decide it's better to take off the glove. You're back to forcing your way through thick entangling vegetation, yet, you somehow feel reassured through your experience and the treasure you now carry with you.

<b>A few of your companions may benefit from using this to comfort them, in this difficult place.</b>

:: Pick up the Empathic Prism [layer1]
<<CollectRelic $relic110>>
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

As you navigate through the unnatural nature of the first layer, you notice a peculiar shift in the air. The ever-present mist seems to part, revealing a small clearing ahead. At its center stands a crystalline structure, its facets refracting the dim light in mesmerizing patterns.

Approaching cautiously, you realize the structure is actually a colossal version of a prism. Its surface is cool to the touch, and as your fingers trace its edges, the giant prism begins to shrink. Within moments, it's small enough to fit in your palm, refracting the surrounding light into a spectrum of colors.

Holding the prism up to your eye, you're suddenly overwhelmed by spectral images flooding your vision. You see shadowy outlines of undiscovered Relics scattered throughout this layer, some surrounded by vibrant auras of emotion. <<if $hiredCompanions.length > 0>>Ghostly echoes of your companions' voices whisper in your mind, hinting at the conversations these items might spark, before falling silent.<</if>>

The vision fades as quickly as it appeared, leaving you slightly disoriented. You carefully pocket the Empathic Prism as you move on.

<b>You can use this Relic to see which undiscovered Relics and Curses on your current layer would provoke strong reactions from your companions.</b>

	As the erection gradually subsides, you find yourself shifting awkwardly, trying to find a way to accommodate your member that insists on staying at a larger size than you're used to.

Your milk ducts are expanding with your breasts, and the intricate network of functional and nervous tissues tingles as the swelling finally subsides. You glance down at your new $mc.breastsLabel cup breasts, and the motion sends a subtle jiggle through them.

A sudden compulsion washes over you, you need to get of your accessories, immediately. It's like they have suddenly become an unbearably uncomfortable burden on your mind. Whether it is a hat, a necklace, or a ring, you cannot accept keeping it on your body for any longer.

While it doesn't cause you any physical pain or anything like that, you do feel a fixation on removing it as soon as possible, as if you had a form of selective OCD that made your remove all of your accessories. And you know that from now on, you won't be wearing any accessories in the future, at least not of your own free will.

<<if $mc.sex === "male">>
You feel an intense squeezing sensation between your legs, as if something was squeezing your cock extremely tightly, but not in a pleasurable way. It isn't quite painful either, almost like someone had their hand gripped around your girth and squeezed as hard as they could all around it, but without any movement or sensations of rubbing the surface, just the squeezing. And it just keeps squeezing as if the pressure was resisting your current size and was pushing part of you back into your body.<br><br>

After a few moments of this sensation, it fades, leaving you to deal with the aftermath. When you check yourself, it looks like your penis has almost entirely disappeared, leaving only a small nub, more reminiscent of a clitoris than your previous size. A quick mental estimation tells you that it is now only 1cm (0.5in) long, with a proportional width. This is quite a dramatic change, hopefully you can come to accept your new body.
<<elseif $mc.sex === "female">>
You feel an intense squeezing sensation on your breasts, but it isn't like someone's hand squeezing them in a pleasurable way. It feels like a pressure evenly distributed across them, like if you're deep underwater, but only on your chest. After a moment, the pressure increases, feeling like it is pushing your flesh into your abdomen, even if there's nowhere for it to go.<br><br>

Instinctively, your hands move up to your chest in response to the strange sensation, and you feel your flesh squirming and pulsing under your fingers. It feels like your body is trying to burst out of some imaginary constraint, but is failing, and each attempt is more feeble than the last. And after a few more attempts, your body succumbs and the sensation fades, leaving you with much smaller assets than you had before. A quick evaluation tells you that you seem to have AA cup breasts now, with no way to increase that size.

You suddenly feel a tingling sensation over your whole body below your scalp, which suddenly becomes very itchy as each of the hair follicles on your body expels any hair they held within them and then shrivels up forever. A cursory feel of your body reveals that your skin is much smoother, aside from any existing marks or scars you have. It feels as if your whole body has been waxed, but even more than that in some way, as you know none of the hair will ever return, nor could you create a facsimile of hair anywhere on your body.

You shiver at the sensation, but it quickly passes. You're left with shaking the remaining residue out of your clothes so that it doesn't cause you to get itchy later on your journey.

As you venture deeper into the Abyss, a tingling sensation suddenly spreads across your body. The air around you feels heavy, and the scent of damp earth permeates your senses. Your heartbeat quickens, and you pause to investigate the source of the tingling.

Peeling off your clothes, you discover a splatter of freckles and moles materializing on your skin. They form intriguing patterns, creating an alluring contrast with your complexion. The tingling intensifies as more freckles appear, each one sending a tiny, electric shiver through your nerves.

Curious, you pull out a small mirror to examine your face. As you might expect, you find freckles there as well, scattered across your cheeks and nose like a delicate dusting of cinnamon. You can't help but notice the way they accentuate your features, lending a new depth to your appearance.

The tingling sensation of the freckles appearing on your body is both strange and fascinating, creating an almost fizzy feeling on your skin. The sensation eventually settles down as the changes slow, and you're left with the end result: freckles all over your body.

Your flesh flows outward, extending the itching sensation, as your ears become longer and gain a pointed tip. The itching fades, but your ears still feel a little more sensitive than they did before.

It seems that you now look like either an elf out of a storybook or someone who really wants to look like a elf, for whatever reason. Hopefully you don't mind the occasional odd look if you return to the surface like this.

	In the first moments after the Curse sets in, you hardly notice anything amiss. However, a growing discomfort seizes your body, leaving you feeling sore and aching. You sit down, trying to alleviate the pain as dizziness overwhelms you. The sensation feels familiar, reminiscent of something from long ago... growing pains.<br><br>

	You shake your head, attempting to clear your foggy thoughts. Glancing at your legs, you could almost swear they're lengthening right before your eyes. The change is subtle and slow, making it difficult to discern with your hazy concentration. After a few minutes, the aches mostly subside, and you carefully rise to your feet.<br><br>

	Your newfound height leaves you feeling unsteady, your perception of the world shifted. The curse has taken full effect, leaving you approximately 5 cm (2 inches) taller than before. As you take a step, you nearly tumble to the ground, your foot catching unexpectedly. Adapting to your slightly larger body will require some practice.<br><br>

	In the initial moments after the Curse sets in, nothing seems amiss. Gradually, though, you notice a strange gas – steam, smoke, or perhaps miasma – emanating from your skin. The odor is far from pleasant.

	You attempt to evade the foul smell, but escaping yourself proves to be a challenge. Desperate for clean air, you manage a few gasping breaths in between the stench. Your erratic movements likely appear absurd, but as you continue, another sensation emerges. You feel lighter, as if your body is shrinking.<br><br>

	After a few minutes, you transformation ends and you find your feet landing differently than you expect. The world around you appears subtly larger – you've become 5 cm (2 inches) shorter, altering your perception more than you would have thought possible.<br><br>

A brief tingle passes between your legs<<if $mc.breasts > 0>> and your breasts<</if>>, causing you to immediately come to attention at the momentary sensitivity. You have to stop as you are instantly made aware of the sensation of your underwear touching your skin, and your own movements have become distracting.

You won't be going back to the way things were before, you'll just need to learn to deal with the new stimulation of any touch between your legs. It should be very pleasant when you're intentionally taking advantage of your newly increased sensitivity though.

The energy of the Abyss seeps into your loins, burrowing deep into the core of your desires. A fleeting shiver courses through your genitals as an unexplainable shift occurs within you. 

For a moment, nothing else happens, leaving you puzzled by the bizarre experience. 

But gradually, a newfound certainty washes over you - the realization that your next sexual encounter will be different.

A strange tingling sensation begins at the base of your skull, quickly spreading to encompass your entire brain. It feels as if your thoughts are being stirred with a giant spoon, swirling and mixing in ways you can't quite comprehend. You open your mouth to comment on this bizarre feeling, but what comes out surprises you.

<<say $mc>>Oh em gee, like, what is even happening right now?<</say>>
Your eyes widen in shock. That's not how you usually talk! You try to focus, attempting to form a more eloquent sentence in your mind. But as you do, you feel the words slipping away, replaced by simpler, more stereotypically "ditzy" phrases.

<<say $mc>>This is, like, totally weird and stuff. My brain feels all fuzzy and, um, sparkly? Is that even a thing?<</say>>
You realize with a mix of fascination and horror that your ability to articulate complex ideas has been severely compromised. Your vocabulary seems to have shrunk, with words like "like" and "totally" taking center stage in your mental lexicon.

As you try to process this change, you find yourself twirling a strand of hair around your finger, a gesture you've never habitually done before.

Congratulations? You managed to take a captive to drag along with you on your journey! The captured bandit will function as a companion but with a few notable differences. 

For starters, she lacks the purity gene, so you'll need to ensure she's fed and hydrated during your expedition.

Second, while she's bound, don't trust her with important equipment or Relics — her carrying capacity is effectively zero.

And third, she resents you. She'll be constantly seeking an opportunity to escape and might even try to take a few valuables along if you aren't vigilant.

:: Layer1 Bandits Veil [layer1]

As you step into the relative serenity of the shallows, your form flickers, the façade of humanity ever so briefly shimmering to reveal the eldritch terror beneath. An almost alien sense of space seems to permate the area around you, casting eerie shadows that sway and jerk in patterns that defy the natural laws of light and shadow.

<<say $banditLeader>>Well, lookie here, fellas! A diver returning with loot. Give it up, stranger, and we won't have to turn ugly.<</say>>
There's a bravado in the bandit leader's voice, a forced laugh hiding behind her threat. The others echo her sentiment, a pack of hyenas circling their intended prey. Their guns, weathered and ill-maintained, glint under the dim light. In their eyes, you see a glimmer of desperation, not unlike a cornered animal.

<<say $mc>>I suggest you reconsider.<</say>>
Your voice sounds odd even to your ears, an unsettling harmonious dissonance, as if a choir of Abyssal voices have replaced your own. The air grows colder, as the pressure around you seems to increase, a palpable sense of dread permeating the environment. The bandit leader chuckles nervously, trying to mask the tremble in her voice.

<<say $banditLeader>>A tough one, eh? Alright then, let's do this the hard way.<</say>>
As the bandit moves to aim her pistol, you let your façade drop further. The sight they behold isn't one that human minds are meant to comprehend. A nightmarish figure, tendrils writhing, eyes like voids in the universe, form shifting and changing in ways that defy spatial and temporal understanding. Madness is a small price to pay for such a revelation.

<<say $mc>>Still eager to fight?<</say>>
The bandits stagger back, their faces a mask of terror. Their sanity is hanging by a thread, their eyes darting, unable to comprehend the entity they're confronting. A couple of them drop their weapons, falling to their knees, consumed by the terror of your otherworldly visage.

<<say $banditLeader>>N... no... please... just... go.<</say>>
Her voice barely a whimper, the leader backs away, stumbling over her own feet, scrambling to create distance. They'd been prepared to face a weary traveler, but an eldritch being from the Abyss? The sight is enough to send them running in fear, leaving behind their ill-gotten gains, their greed replaced by a primal desire for survival. You continue on your path, leaving the bandits to the mercy of their nearly shattered sanity.

When you first saw Outcast village you already fell in love. Its rustic charm endeared you. So even though you weren't too severely effected by the Curses from the Abyss, you decided you wanted to stay here anyway. Over time you quickly became closely connected with the rest of the small community. You enjoyed your life for the most part, but as time grew on you started to miss some of the amenities the top side could provide you. Although you still went to the surface on occasion to enjoy those, you started to wonder if there wasn't something that could be done in Outcast village. You debated it a bit with the rest of the community and decided to put the fortune you had left over from your Abyss diving days into water turbines to improve the power available for the village. Over time this modernised the town a bit as appliances from the surface started pouring in, but in the end Outcast village never really lost its rustic feel. For your efforts the community promoted you to the mayor of the town, which you gladly accepted. With a community of around 300 people it was more a title than a job anyway. And so you lived a long, comfortable and quiet life in Outcast village.

Some days after helping out in the fields you found that you could just enjoy yourself sitting near a water edge and laying back in the grass, listening to the sounds of nature around you. You became a valued and central member in the community of Outcast village, spending many evenings drinking and sharing stories about your Abyss diving days. In the end you lived a simple but happy life in Outcast village

At some point enough is enough, and with your body regressed at much as yours was you felt it would be better to just call it quits. With your apparent young age you felt it would be difficult to return to the surface so you settled in Outcast village. While you could see various other ex-adventures that had also regressed quite far, most seem at least to still be at a teenager level, and you felt you were being treated more like a kid than the rest. Of course you looked at ways to provide for yourself but that proved more difficult than you thought. You couldn't help out in the fields around town and working on some of the construction projects was even more impossible. If it weren't for your considerable savings after your Abyss diving adventure you wouldn't have known what to do. Outcast village was very accommodating to regressed divers so you were able to buy a place for yourself and maintain yourself for a while. You decided to still be frugal though, not knowing how long it would take before you could work for your own food. Before long some people in the community understood what was going on, and before you knew it you felt like you were constantly surrounded by people, bringing food or treating you to a dinner. Sometimes you felt you were being babysat by 300 people, but at the same time being looked after by 300 people also felt nice. The family across the street was especially nice, at some point you spent more than half the nights eating at their place. The days you stayed at home the father of the family would still check up on you in the morning and in the evening the mother would often stop by to bring you some left over dinner (which tasted suspiciously fresh). She never left before giving you a big kiss and a big hug. Over time you became sort of the town mascot and everywhere you go people greeted you and asked if they could help you with stuff. When you first started to live in Outcast village you worried that growing back up by yourself would be really hard, but after a few years it was clear that your family that helped you all along the way was now bigger than ever.

With your apparent young age you felt it would be difficult to return to the surface so you settled in Outcast village. While you could see various other ex-adventures that had also regressed quite far, most seem at least to still be at a teenager level. With not much left over from your Curse diving expedition you felt at a loss. You couldn't help out in the fields around town and working on some of the construction projects was even more impossible. Luckily the rest of the small community quickly recognised your plight. A small family basically adopted you into their household. Over time they really started to feel like a real family too. You looked up to your new stepdad, he worked so hard in the village but when he came home he always had time to mess around with you, giving you horse rides on his neck. He really loved his new little <<PerceivedGender $mc>>. Your older stepsister wasn't always nice to you, she seemed to enjoy treating you like a little kid most out of everybody as she knew it stung you a bit. When she was babysitting you she would sometimes give you her old sippy cup instead of a regular glass to drink. While it annoyed you it wasn't all bad as she tended to forget she was teasing you after a while and started to genuinely play games with you. And finally there was your new stepmother, although she didn't tease you with your regressed condition she simply couldn't help herself pampering you as much as she did. This also annoyed you at first but over time you started to love every second of it. She was bathing you, doing your hair, dressing you and even feeding you at dinner. As the years would go by this would slowly grow less and less, while the love for you new family only increased. Nevertheless, after many many years thoughts about venturing into the deeper layers of the Abyss were entering your mind again...

	<<say $rndF>>I didn't, I asked if you are looking for a mother. The abyss seems to think you would fit the role of a child.<</say>>
	As she says that she motions to your regressed body.

	<<say $rndF>>And I think I would fit the role of a mother.<</say>>
	The woman winks at you with that last sentence, while cocking her hip. A wet spot starts to form around one of her nipples. Her hand shoots towards to cover it.

	<<say $rndF>>Shoot, this patch is saturated again, damn curse.<</say>>
	She mumbles to herself, before focussing back on you and giving you a warm smile.

	<<say $rndF>>Well, are going to make me ask again if you need a mother?<</say>>
	<<say $mc>>I'm not sure...<</say>>
	<<say $rndF>>Ow come on, I've been lonely and bored since I got stranded her a few years ago. Try it for a few days? Trust me, you like it!<</say>>
	She steps closer, lowers her body and spreads her arms, clearly intending to hug you.

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and Curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threats that await you on the layer

Finally, the vision fades, leaving you standing once again where you were before, with only a brief sense of motion sickness as you orient yourself back to your physical body. As you look at the Gleam Dazer once again, you notice the Relic is cracked and broken.

When you go to sleep, you dream once again.

You dream about the playroom you were in, with your dolly.

Your tattered pink dress doesn't look tattered at all anymore. It looks just like your dolly's dress. In fact, you started to look more like your dolly as well. But that's okay. It makes you look like a cute pair of twins after all.

You have tea time with your dolly, chatting away about how beautiful your dresses are, how tasty your tea is, and how nice it is to spend this time together.

You also play house with your dolly, taking turns switching who is the mommy and who is the baby. And once you get tired of playing you cuddle with your dolly until you fall a sleep again, just so you could play with her more the next day! It's so much fun!

Over time she even grows a lot so you can cuddle better! That's so nice of your dolly, she is the best! She's so considerate of you, making sure you're always content and comfortable where you are.

Sometimes you get a feeling like you lost something. Something precious to you that is now gone and locked away. But the feeling never lasts long as you sink back into your happy and comfortable life.

<<say $rndM>> Look! There they are! We found 'em! <</say>>
<<say $rndF>> I don't know... They look pretty creepy to me.<</say>>
<<say $rndM>> Duh, that's why they are called the Creepy Twin Dolls. What else did you expect? <</say>>
<<say $rndF>> What do you think they do? I heard they're creepy, but there must be something more. Nothing is simple down here. <</say>>
<<say $rndM>> I don't know. But a Relic is Relic. Worst case scenario we just sell 'em. But, who knows, they might just do something awesome! Here, take one, I'll keep the other.<</say>>
<<say $rndF>> You know what, now that I'm holding one it actually doesn't feel as creepy anymore. In a weird way, it feels comforting. I think maybe I'll just keep her.<</say>>
<<say $rndM>> Haha, that was a quick 180! But I sort of get what you mean. They can be our good luck charms, maybe they'll help keep us alive.<</say>>

On some layers people have gathered to form small settlements. These settlements serve as a place where one can retire after their journey as a permanent habitation option, but sometimes you can also interact with them before you settle down. Unfortunately you won't have time to fully explore these places without choosing to settle down in one of them, but you can still check out some of what they have to offer!
<br><br>
Similar to Outset Town, residents and shops can be found in this village. But since the resources are much more limited down here, you can expect their services to be much more limited than the ones you'd find on the surface.</p>

	Near the village's outskirts, you notice a heated debate among a group of villagers. They're discussing the potential introduction of hydroelectric generators to Outcast Village. One side argues passionately for the benefits of electricity, envisioning a future where the village thrives with new technological advancements. The opposing side, equally fervent, advocates for preserving the village's rustic charm, fearing that too much change might disrupt the close-knit community and the simple life they've come to cherish. The debate continues, without any clear conclusion. It's clear opinion is split on the issue.<br><br>

	As you wander through the dimly lit streets of Outcast Village, a curious sight catches your eye. A tall figure, adorned with delicate moth wings that flutter gently, stands before a small crowd, spinning tales of ancient Abyss legends. The storyteller's captivating voice seems to enchant his listeners, who hang onto every word. His tales are a mix of heroism and tragedy. He tells of a hero that reaches down to the bottom of the sixth layer and finds endless splendor, but is unable to return due to the pressure of the miasma. Of course, if the hero was trapped there, how could anyone up here tell his story? But the story isn't about the hero, it's about the legend.<br><br>

	On the outskirts of the village, beneath the canopy of the twilight sky, you spot a trio of figures sharing a quiet moment together. Two women and a man, each bearing distinctive marks of their journey into the Abyss - horns, glowing skin, and feathered wings, respectively - sit closely, intertwined. Their conversation, low and filled with laughter, pauses as they share a series of tender kisses and caresses. It's amazing how open they are with their affection here, compared to what you'd see on the surface.<br><br>
