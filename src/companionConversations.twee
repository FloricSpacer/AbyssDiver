You wrap Maru in a warm hug. He feels snugly against your chest.

Maru cheerfully brings you a meal he made, checking to see if it is as satisfying as he hopes it is. 

<<say $mc>> You know, we're traveling together in one of the most dangerous places in the world, yet I<<if $IQdrop >10>>, like,<</if>> know almost<<if $IQdrop >20>>, like,<</if>> nothing about you. Do you want to tell me anything about yourself?<</say>>

:: Maru Convo1 Childhood
<<set $companionMaru.affec+=(1+$hsswear)>>\
<<say $mc>>Could you tell me something about your<<if $IQdrop >15>>, like,<</if>> childhood?<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>> Well, I was mostly raised by my big sister. She was nice, but not exactly the most gentle person ever. Maybe overprotective would be a better way to describe it. When I was younger I wasn't really allowed to play outside or do anything that might be too rough. Sometimes it was a little annoying, but I understand why she was doing it.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>I can <<if $IQdrop >15>>you know, totally <</if>>imagine that was a little tough.<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>>Yeah, but it wasn't all bad. I think she was just looking out for me, since I am the youngest. We were a very tight family, so we did a lot of stuff with each other. And in a way it forced me to learn to cook and sow as well, since I wanted to do things with my sister.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Is that also the reason why you are wearing <<if $IQdrop >20>>, like super duper<</if>> feminine clothing? Were they<<if $IQdrop >10>>, like,<</if>> forcing you to do this?<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>> No! No, nothing like that. As a child I think I looked pretty feminine.  Well, even more than now I mean. My sisters liked to play dress-up with me, and I actually liked it too. Sometimes I thought that I shouldn't be doing it, but eventually I realized that if it makes me happy, then there's no reason I should stop.<</say>>
He pauses for a moment as he seems to gather his thoughts.

<<say $companionMaru>> Over time I really began to appreciate how well my sisters cared for me. I don't know if it's the same for everyone, but I was glad they accepted what I liked and we could do things together and be happy.<</say>>
You ponder his story for a bit.

<<say $mc>> Thanks for<<if $IQdrop >20>>, like,<</if>> sharing that with me. How are your sisters doing?<</say>>
His expression falls, and he looks down in silence for a few seconds before responding. 

<<say $companionMaru>>They all left.<</say>>
After a few more moments he forces a smile and continues. 

<<say $companionMaru>> Anyway, don't let your meal get cold!<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Oh, sure, thanks for the <<if $IQdrop >15>>totally yummy <</if>>meal!<</say>>
As you take in the food, you realize it takes shockingly good for something made with such limited ingredients. How did he manage to get the texture just right and the flavors perfectly balanced all the way down here? Maru giggles as he looks at you eating his food.

<<say $companionMaru>> Well, if you like it this much, I'll be sure to make it like this more often!<</say>>

Maru almost chokes on his food and starts nervously stammering.

<<say $companionMaru>> I... I don't know, it just started as a kid and now I just like it I guess.<</say>>

<<say $mc>>Like it? It's absolutely delicious!<</say>>
Maru smiles widely at your comment.

<<say $companionMaru>> Well, in that case it would be cruel for me to not tell you the recipe! Even if it is made from the limited ingredients we have with us here!<</say>>
Maru tells you in detail how he prepared the dish. It's actually pretty simple, but he added some herbs with subtle flavors which seem to have a made a big difference in the final product. And his cooking method was precise to ensure the texture ended up perfect!

Your eyes widen in surprise.

<<say $mc>>Thanks, <<if $IQdrop >10>>but I totally don't need it!<<else>>but I'll try to manage without it.<</if>><</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>>Oh, okay then.<</say>>
Maru appears slightly disheartened.

<<if $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.id === setup.companionIds.lily)>>\
	<<say $companionLily>>What are you two discussing? <</say>>
	A tense silence fills the space, and Maru's cheeks flush a rosy hue.
	<<say $companionLily>>What's this?<</say>>
	As she speaks, Lily snatches the 'protective underwear' from Maru's grasp. She scrutinizes it and glances at you. A mischievous grin spreads across her face.

	<<say $companionLily>>Ah, I understand. This is for your little 'issue,' $mc.name, isn't it?<</say>>
	You look down for a moment, but quickly regain your composure.

	<<say $mc>>Yes, Maru made it, <<if $IQdrop >20>>but I can, totes, look after myself!<<else>>but I just told him I'll handle it myself.<</if>><</say>>
	<<say $companionLily>>Nonsense, you're just too shy to accept this. Here, put it on; it'll be incredibly helpful for you.<</say>>
	She offers the garment to you once more.
	<<if $mc.subdom >0 >>\
		Unable to summon the courage to decline Lily again, you relent.

		<<say $mc>>You're probably right, Lily<</say>>
		You take the cloth diaper from her hands and move to a secluded spot to put it on. As anticipated, it feels bulky between your legs, causing an awkward waddle. You return to Lily and Maru.
	
		<<say $companionLily>>Oh my, you look absolutely adorable, you know that!<</say>>
		As she speaks, she tugs your clothes aside to reveal the cloth diaper. She pats it approvingly a few times.
	
		<<say $companionLily>>Wow, it looks fantastic on you and fits so snugly. Maru, I'm genuinely impressed that you made this here. How did you manage that?<</say>>
		Maru's face beams with pride upon hearing the praise.

		<<say $companionMaru>>I just used cloth scraps and my sewing kit!<</say>>
		<<say $companionLily>>Maru, you must be an incredibly talented tailor! You'll have to make something for me too – not a diaper, of course – but I have some ideas for a dress...<</say>>
		You sit there, awkwardly exposed, while the two engage in an animated conversation about clothing.
	<<else>>\
		<<say $mc>><<if $IQdrop >10>>Lily! I can, like, think for myself!<<else>>I appreciate your concern, Lily, but I can handle it. Don't worry.<</if>><</say>>
		<<say $companionLily>>Well, if you insist.<</say>>
		Lily continues to examine the cloth diaper, still in her possession.

		<<say $companionLily>>It looks as if it's straight from a store, even up close. Maru, you really made this?<</say>>
		<<say $companionMaru>>Yes, I just used cloth scraps and my sewing kit!<</say>>
		<<say $companionLily>>Remarkable! You have to make something for me too – not a diaper, of course – but I have some ideas for a dress...<</say>>				
		Maru's face lights up upon receiving the compliment.

		<<say $companionMaru>>Of course, what did you have in mind?<</say>>
		You leave them to their animated conversation about clothing.

<<say $mc>> <<if $IQdrop >15>>O.M.G. Thank you! This will solve this super stupid problem.<<else>>Thank you, this is really thoughtful. I hope it will help me.<</if>><</say>>
You accept the cloth diaper with a hint of reluctance, unsure of how to feel. Maru's eyes twinkle with anticipation as they watch you, and a brief but palpable silence fills the air between you both.

<<say $companionMaru>> Um, perhaps you could try it on. If it doesn't fit snugly, it won't be much help, you know.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Oh yes, of course.<</say>>
You take the cloth diaper from Maru's hands and find a secluded spot to put it on. As expected, the fabric feels bulky between your legs, resulting in a slightly awkward waddle. You return to Maru, who meticulously inspects the edges of the diaper upon your arrival.

<<say $companionMaru>> I think I managed to get your measurements right! It seems to fit quite well!<</say>>
Grateful, you thank Maru once more and decide to carry on with your journey, now equipped with a little extra padding for comfort.

<<say $companionLily>>Heeeey! I'm Lily, You must be $mc.name, right? Ready for our daring adventure into the belly of the beast, hero? Just stick with me and it'll all work out, don't worry!<</say>>
She points her thumb at her chest and stands proudly, as if to show that she is prepared for anything you might find in the Abyss.

:: Lily Convo0 Hug
<<set $companionLily.affec+=(1+$hsswear)>>\
You give Lily a big hug and you immediately feel her firmly squeezing you back, even lifting your feet a little bit from the ground in her excitement.

<<say $mc>>Hey! Yeah, I'm $mc.name, and I'm<<if $IQdrop >10>>, like,<</if>> so happy that you're joining our team!<</say>>
She releases her grip on you and smiles widely.

<<say $companionLily>>I didn't expect such a warm welcome, but hey I'm not complaining! Especially from such a cute <<PerceivedGender $mc>>.<</say>>
She winks at you and grins as she finishes her comment. You weren't sure if you were going for the cute vibe, but at the very least you want to be taken seriously as an adventurer. On the other hand, you suppose it's good that your new teammate likes you.

You wink back to her <<if $IQdrop >10>>and giggle <</if>>and Lily seems to give you a sly smile in return.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh my, we only just met and you already know what to say to get my engine running!<</say>>
Lily steps forward to approach you, and it almost seems like she's leaning in for a kiss. But before you can react, you suddenly feel a hard pat on your back and open your eyes to see Lily with the widest grin possible on her face.

<<say $companionLily>>But let's not jump the gun here <<mrms>> casanova. We have a whole adventure ahead of us to get to know each other better.<</say>>
She winks at you once again, though you think there may be a bit more of a suggestive tone this time.

<<say $mc>>Look who's talking! I'll<<if $IQdrop >10>> totally<</if>> make sure to protect that cute face of yours and keep you safe too!<</say>>
Lily raises an eyebrow, showing a deep skepticism, and then starts laughing.

<<say $companionLily>>Haha! Don't worry about it <<mrms>> hero. I can take pretty good care of myself. But I'll be sure to let you know just in case I find some other damsel in distress you can save.<</say>>
She starts snicker at her own joke. You're not quite sure if it's a joke at your expense, but she doesn't seem to clarify. Regardless, she seems to be in good spirits and that's what's important in the end, right?

<<say $mc>>Haha, good one, Lily.<</say>>
[[End your conversation|Party overview]]

:: Lily Convo0 Kiss
You close your eyes and move your face close to kiss her. But as your face approached hers, your cheeks are suddenly grabbed with surprising strength as Lily pushes you back with an annoyed scoff.

<<say $companionLily>>There is something to be said about being so forward... But there's also something about not reading signals correctly, right?<</say>>
Flustered, you find yourself at a loss for words and don't manage to find a response quickly enough.

<<say $mc>>I'm so sorry... I<<if $IQdrop >15>>,like totally,<</if>> just thought that... You know...<</say>>
Lily sighs deeply and her face lightens up a little bit as she raises her eyebrows.

<<say $companionLily>>Yeah, maybe I do know? Well, I guess I am an awfully cute little angel, right?<</say>>
She frames her face between her hands as she gives you a sly smile once again.

<<say $companionLily>>Next time, maybe just buy a girl some flowers and a dinner first, okay?<</say>>
<<say $mc>><<if $IQdrop >20>>Totes!<<else>>Absolutely!<</if>><</say>>

[[End your conversation|Party overview][$companionLily.affec+=(1+$hsswear)]]

:: Lily Convo0 Handshake
<<set $companionLily.affec-=(2-$hsswear)>>\
You reach out and give a her a firm handshake, which she reciprocates in her own surprisingly firm manner, given her slender frame.

<<say $mc>>I'm glad to have you<<if $IQdrop >5>>, like,<</if>> onboard! I'm $mc.name.<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>Oh, so formal! But I guess that's fine.<</say>>
She shrugs and chuckles lightly.

<<say $companionLily>>Just don't start asking me about my hobbies next.<</say>>

Lily grins, straightens her back, and puts on a mock formal voice.

<<say $companionLily>>Well thank you for asking <<mrms>> boss <<PerceivedGender $mc>>. My hobbies include listening to pop music and traveling. I've traveled to lots of the countries around this world already! What can I say? I guess I'm just the adventurous type. <</say>>
You mimic her tone and play along.

<<say $mc>> Ah yes, <<if $IQdrop >15>>, like, super duper<<else>>excellent<</if>> to hear that miss Lily, what would you<<if $IQdrop >5>>, like,<</if>> say your...<</say>>
Before you can finish your sentence, she interrupts you.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh, and anime too! The best thing is if I can combine both! I once travelled half way around the world for this awesome anime convention. You wouldn't believe the cute little snacks they had over there. Sometimes I wish I could go back, but in my life I prefer to always move forward and not get fixated on the past. Oh, but there was this other time where...<</say>>
In the end Lily rambles on for quite a while about her various travels, what anime see likes, what songs she like, and what anime songs she likes. Even if you can't quite follow all of her stories or don't know much about the places she mentions, she seems happy as long as you make an effort and nod along.

<<set $companionLily.affec-=(1-$hsswear)>>\
<<say $mc>> Don't worry, I<<if $IQdrop >10>> totally<</if>> won't!<</say>>
Lily's face betrays an obvious confusion.

<<say $companionLily>>Uh, I was kinda hoping you would, actually. I didn't think you'd give up so easily, but don't worry! I'll be sure to tell you about myself on our long journey into the Abyss, we'll have plenty of time to chat there!<</say>>
She playfully sticks her tongue at you. Although the conversation could have gone a bit smoother, she still made you laugh in the end.

<<set $companionLily.affec-=(1-$hsswear)>>
You stand a bit awkwardly and wave hello to her from a distance.

<<say $mc>>So uh, yeah<<if $IQdrop >5>>, like,<</if>>, I'm $mc.name. It's nice to meet you!<</say>>
Lily looks you over with a raised eyebrow after which a smile quickly forms on her face.

<<say $companionLily>>Haha, don't be scared! I won't bite unless you want me to.<</say>>
She winks at you and smiles even wider at her own implied joke.

Lily immediately starts laughing gently.

<<say $companionLily>>You know what, you might be a little awkward, but I can already tell we're going to have some fun together and get along just fine!<</say>>
She pokes you in your sides playfully as she talks.

<<say $companionLily>>So tell me more about yourself. What do you like? Do you do these kinds of expeditions often? I always really love going on new adventures and exploring!<</say>>
You talk for quite some time afterwards. She is actually quite attentive and interested in what you have to say, although she does tend to go on a rambling streak from time to time when you give her the chance.

She says while booping your nose. She sighs and continues with a somewhat more serious tone.

She sighs deeply once again.

<<say $companionLily>>She taught me that no matter how tough life gets, if you face it with a smile, then it will make everything a little bit easier. And that you have to keep looking forward, not back. I guess I forgot that for a second.<</say>>

Lily snaps out of her apparent stupor, her eyes suddenly sparkling with energy.

<<say $companionLily>>Nah, I never do that. You know me!<</say>>

Lily hesitates for a moment before speaking a bit more softly.

<<say $companionLily>>To be honest, the future.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Oh, yeah, that's pretty different from the past. So why are you thinking about the future?<</say>>
Lily scratches her head and gazes upward.

<<say $companionLily>>I don't know, and that's kind of the issue. I have some clear ideas about what I want, but I'm not sure how to make them compatible.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Well, surely if you think about it, you can try to make it work! What do you want that seems so incompatible?<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>On one hand, I really want a vibrant social life! Maybe I should say I crave it. But if I start sharing all my awesome stories with trees, they'll lock me up before long!<</say>>

<<say $companionLily>>I'll give you a pass on that one, since traveling the Abyss is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience for most. But I've heard that same line so many times before. People go to the same type of bars and do the same things for years, just with different people every once in a while.

<<say $companionLily>>Come here, sweety.<</say>>
She pushes your head against the nipple of her breast. You put up something of a weak struggle, as you don't want to hurt her, but you're willing to go along with her at this point. Her strong arms don't move an inch.

Journeying onward, the effects of the Abyss's miasma and your reduced stature become glaringly apparent, especially as you struggle over another rock.

Suddenly, two warm hands cradle you from the sides.

<<say $companionLily>>Need a boost, sweetie?<</say>>
With that, she lifts you atop the rock.

<<say $mc>>Thanks, Lily. The Abyss is proving to be more challenging with my new size.<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>Really? I hadn't noticed! Maybe things just seem larger from down there.<</say>>
She giggles, clearly enjoying her obvious tease.

<<say $mc>>Alright, alright. Yes, I've shrunk. But it wouldn't be so bad if it didn't make navigating The Abyss so challenging.<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>But you're adorable like this! You're like a little chibi $mc.name. Imagine the attention you'd get at conventions!<</say>>
She playfully pinches your cheek, eliciting a swat from you.

<<say $mc>>Let's focus on the mission, okay? No time for daydreaming about conventions.<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>True. But think about it: we could speed things up if you'd let me help you a little more.<</say>>
Her eyes sparkle with a hint of mischief.

<<say $mc>>What kind of help?<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>Well, if you would let <<if $LilyConvoLac>>Mommy<<else>>yours truly<</if>>give you a piggyback, you wouldn't have to face these pesky challenges. Plus, I'd get to snuggle with an adorable mini-hero!<</say>>
With a cheeky grin, she flexses her strong yet slender arms.

<<say $companionKhemia>>And once, we were running low on supplies and  everybody thought they were done for. Things were getting really desperate and the main diver was even saying some prayers, like he didn't think we were gonna make it. But I led them through a cave complex I'd known from a previous dive, showed them a shortcut to a nice foraging spot and a quicker path back up to the surface. By the time we were back to the surface we even had a few days of supplies to spare! <</say>>

:: Khemia Convo1
You pause for a moment, taking stock of where you are. Looking back, you notice that Khemia has picked up a stick and appears to be performing some kind of sword kata. You watch him, fascinated by his movements. The way he darts and spins, always keeping his balance over where he is, or where he's going to be. He flows between forms, dodging imaginary opponents, and apparently dispatching them one after another. The more you watch though, the more you think this isn't just some memorized kata, he's improvising, creating a dynamic scenario in his head, and reacting to it.

He performs an improbable flip in the air, lashing out with the stick, and then driving it down into the dirt on his landing.

He's breathing heavily, but there's no trembling in his motions as he stands and looks over at you. He smirks.

Cherry stares at you, then a minute passes. Finally, Cherry exhales.

You chuckle a bit at your own joke. Surely your successful art-themed joke will resonate with her and lighten the mood!

Cherry's eyes focus on you, and for a moment you think you see a hint of an emotion. However, her eyes still look haunted, and she doesn't say anything in response to your brilliant humor.

As you both set off again, her gait isn't energetic. But still she walks, with a trudging endurance, bearing a burden that you don't understand. In some ways, it's even more impressive that she's able to keep moving on a journey like this despite her emotional state.

A tear rolls down her cheek, but she doesn't seem to notice as she continues staring into the distance.

Cherry nods, her eyes are more focused again and she seems to look at you properly for the first time in the conversation. She still looks sad, and you suspect she has more issues than simply grief, since so little of the world seems to make it through to her. But perhaps you've helped lessen her pain just a little bit.

Her tears are drying, and you can see a small seed of resolve growing in her.

<<say $mc>>But now that you've admitted it, maybe we can work something out.<</say>>
You wink at her, seductively revealing a breast. Cherry blinks rapidly, turning away to give you some privacy.

<<say $companionCherry>>No, no, I definitely didn't mean it that way. I really was only interested in the milk itself.<</say>>
You cover yourself once again upon hearing her say that and look at her, a hint of confusion evident on your face.

<<say $mc>>Oh, okay, I'm sorry about that. Why do you want the milk?<</say>>
<<say $companionCherry>>You probably think it's stupid, but I've been called the black cat of the family for the longest time. And now I'm kind of living up to that nickname, and I sort of want some milk right now...<</say>>
Her voice trails off, as if she can't bring herself to explain her desires to you so openly.

<<say $mc>>Not the black sheep?<</say>>
<<say $companionCherry>>No, the black cat. I guess it's because I've always been an unlucky omen for them. And I guess some part of me wished I was really a black cat, and not a person.<</say>>
<<say $companionCherry>> I wouldn't have to interact with people anymore and nobody would expect anything of me. I could finally live a peaceful, happy life.<</say>>
She looks down in silence. Her embarrassment has faded, leaving her with an empty expression, as if she's stopped caring about anything in the world.

<<say $mc>>Cherry, that's...<</say>>

<<say $companionCherry>> Happier...<</say>>
She looks at you and gives you a weak smile. It isn't joyful, but it's something. Which really is saying something for someone like Cherry.

<<say $companionCherry>>I just thought drinking milk from a saucer like a cat could add to that. But, well, milk is pretty hard to come by down here so... Yeah...<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Ah, I get it. But I'm not sure I've ever seen a real cat drink milk from a saucer, and I think we don't have proper saucers here.<</say>>
Cherry's face turns into a pout, and manages to wordlessly cut off any complaints you have about the situation.

<<say $mc>>You know what, give me a second.<</say>>
You grab one of the dishes from your backpack and gently squeeze your nipple a few times to squirt some milk onto it. You repeat the process until at least the bottom of the dish is covered with a creamy, white fluid. Then you cover yourself again and turn to Cherry.

<<say $mc>>Like this?<</say>>
You place the dish with milk on the ground and see Cherry's eyes widen, as if she didn't expect you to comply with such an unusual desire she had. At first, she seems bashful that you're not leaving her alone, but eventually, she gets on all fours, as if she fully embraced a feline identity. Then she slowly approaches the milk and begins lapping it up.

<<say $mc>>You know, you're pretty cute like this.<</say>>
You start petting her on her head and run your hands through her hair, causing her to tense up, but eventually, she relaxes and even leans into your hand as you pet her.

You give Cloud a firm hug. He seems a bit surprised but keeps his cool and reciprocates, matching your strength.

<<say $mc>>I'm $mc.name, I'm so happy to have you onboard!<</say>>
Cloud grins widely as he replies.

<<say $companionCloud>>You're pretty smooth, already buttering me up. I thought I was supposed to work for you.<</say>>

Cloud chuckles a bit and a genuine smile flows across his lips.

<<say $companionCloud>>Well, I couldn't argue with you there, pal. It's pretty important to know that we can have each other's backs when we're down there. <</say>>
His face suddenly takes on a gravely serious expression for a moment, but it almost immediately breaks into his usual wide, charismatic smile.

<<say $mc>>I think you're right, and I'm glad we can can have each others backs!<</say>>

<<say $mc>>Well, I've heard you have some powerful connections, so being a little extra nice couldn't hurt.<</say>>
You attempt to give him a playful smile, but his expression is surprisingly blank.

<<say $companionCloud>>If you really need something then I can make it happen for you, but you'll need to pay it back with interest, so be sure it's worth it.<</say>>
There is no hint of his typical casual suavity in his face, he looks deadly serious.

<<say $companionCloud>>Or maybe you can try one of those surprise hugs on the shopkeeper, and we can see if you'll get enough of a discount to afford everything we need. Ha ha ha!<</say>>
You can't help but crack up a little at the absurdity of the proposal.

<<say $mc>>Ha ha, sure, but you had better not complain about not being special if I can get a discount on my own like that!<</say>>
You spend a few more minutes exchanging casual banter with Cloud before moving on to the other tasks you had to work on.

You give him a firm handshake, and he responds in kind while flashing you a wide, charming smile.

He touches your chin lightly so you look each other in the eyes and smiles.

Despite the fact you had no romantic intentions at all in this conversation, Cloud still manages to make your heart race. Perhaps it's best to keep your relationship professional, but he sure is a charming guy, isn't he?

<<say $companionCloud>>Why are you asking?<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Uh, I don't know. I, uh... just wanted to know how good you were I guess?<</say>>
After an awkward moment, he starts to break out in a grin once again.

<<say $companionCloud>>Ah, I see. Well, if I'm being honest, then the answer is yes, I have.<</say>>
You can't help but hold you breath in anticipation of the story.

<<say $companionCloud>>I always slay at parties! People have told me I'm dangerously funny. <</say>>
The awkwardness is defused as he walks off, laughing at his own joke, and leaving you standing there feeling a little silly.

You stand around a bit awkwardly and wave hello to him from a distance.

He looks at you, slightly perplexed, and scratches the back of his head.

<<say $companionCloud>>Don't worry about it, the most important thing for an expedition is to have a leader with good character and teammates who have each others' backs. And I think we're doing good in that department. We can learn anything else along the way! Especially with me by your side.<</say>>

His typically carefree face seems to contort into a new expression, anger. It takes a moment for it to revert back to his normal, casual expression.

<<say $companionCloud>>Lies will get people killed. Lie to me again and I won't take kindly to it. If you don't know something, just say so. This is no place to play pretend and you'll need to be able to recognize your own weakness to be able to survive in the Abyss. I'm asking you to take this seriously so no once gets hurt down there.<</say>>
He storms off, leaving you shaken and unsure what to say. That certainly could have gone better...

Although that wasn't the smoothest conversation ever, you did get a feeling that Cloud liked you.

:: Cloud Convo1
As you were walking, Cloud suddenly sprints ahead a few meters and kneels by the side of the road. When you walk over, you see him hunched over a body with multiple injuries which seem to be bullet wounds, or maybe stab wounds?

<<say $mc>> What do you think happened to him? Do you think it could have been the bandits we were warned about earlier?<</say>>
<<say $companionCloud>> Hard to say for sure, but it it were bandits, they were either cruel or simple amateurs, who wouldn't pose a real threat to us.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> What makes you say that? <</say>>
Cloud points to a spot on the back of the corpse.

<<say $companionCloud>> Look, here. He was shot in the back. <</say>>
You see cloud moving the body onto its belly to point at a gunshot wound in the upper back.

<<say $companionCloud>> But it seems off target, if you look at the angle of entry and the trauma around the shoulders, the bullet is probably lodged in there somewhere near the shoulder blades.<</say>>
He then pushes the body onto its back and points at the other wounds.

<<say $companionCloud>> And these are stab wounds, but every single one missed a vital organ. Based on the amount of blood here, my guess is that he bled out in the end after managing to get away at first.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> That sounds pretty gruesome, why would they do that to him? <</say>>
<<say $companionCloud>> Indeed, it must have been. Check his bag. If my guess is right, we might be able to find something useful. <</say>>

You follow his instructions and reach into the small backpack besides the pale corpse. Inside, your fingers find the familiar jingle of dubloon coins.

<<say $mc>>You sure seem to know a lot about bandits. Have you had any experience with them?<</say>>
You hunch to check the bag as you speak.

<<say $companionCloud>> Of course, I am a notorious former bandit. I'm surprised you didn't know.<</say>>
Cloud grins and you simply stare at him in shock.

<<say $companionCloud>> I became quite infamous after stealing the hearts of countless ladies and a few men with my daring escapades. Alas, those days are long gone and now I must work to change things in the world above so that all people can have true freedom, without fear of governments or bandits.<</say>>
He looks up wistfully and has a big, goofy grin on his face, seemingly not worried about your response. You laugh a bit, but a part of you wonders whether it was truly a joke or if it had a hint of truth within.

Cloud seems surprised for a moment, but then his face hardens.

<<say $companionCloud>> And how long do you think you're going to survive with that attitude, here in the Abyss? You have to be willing to get your hands dirty and do what it takes to get an advantage here. We didn't hurt him and its not like he'll be using the coins any more, right? We might as well make use of anything we can to make sure we survive. With the way the world is right now, that's what you have to do to survive.<</say>>
He opens the pack on the ground, pulls out a few dubloons and tosses them your way. 

<<say $companionCloud>> Don't get me wrong, it's good you have some moral compass.<</say>>
He pauses and steels his gaze even more

<<say $companionCloud>> But I hate naive people as they tend to end up like this.<</say>>
Cloud looks up wistfully as if at some unseen dream, but then shakes his head.

<<say $companionCloud>> But what do I know? Maybe with my wits and your moral compass, just maybe, we can make the world a better place in the future, together.<</say>>
He smacks your back with a big grin and continues on his way.

<<say $mc>>Yeah, sorry, I'm still adjusting to this whole lactating thing.<</say>>
<<say $companionCloud>> I understand, but you should probably try to get used to it, as it might be like this for quite a while .<</say>>

<<set $companionCloud.affec+=(1+$hsswear)>>
<<say $mc>>Okay, I trust you.<</say>>
With a hint of trepidation, you turn around again and raise your arms. Cloud swiftly completes the task of undressing you, leaving you vulnerably exposed, your bare breasts on full display.

<<say $companionCloud>> Now, this is the part where you need to relax. Close your eyes and envision vast, verdant, tranquil fields.<</say>>
You follow his instruction, shutting your eyes and picturing yourself in a lush meadow on the surface, with the sun's warm embrace caressing your face and the grass teasing your bare feet.

You sense Cloud's hands gently cup your breasts and begin to tenderly massage them. His touch is surprisingly delicate despite his formidable strength, and although your breasts are sensitive, the sensation is quite pleasurable.

<<say $companionCloud>> Now, follow my lead.<</say>>
You feel his hands guiding you to your knees and bending you forward onto your hands. He tenderly pulls at your nipples, and milk begins to stream out. A wave of relief washes over you as the pressure within your breasts subsides.

<<say $mc>>That feels amazing.<</say>>
<<say $companionCloud>>I told you it would. I used to perform a similar technique quite a bit back in the day.<</say>>
You're momentarily taken aback, but any movement is restrained by Cloud's body hovering protectively over you.

<<say $mc>>You massaged a lot of breasts?<</say>>
<<say $companionCloud>> Ha, I won't confirm or deny that, but that's not what I meant.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Oh, okay?<</say>>
You relax slightly and allow your thoughts to drift back to the serene pasture.

<<say $companionCloud>> No, back in the day, I had some experience dealing with restless cows.<</say>>
Cloud shifts to your side, all the while continuing to skillfully draw milk from your nipples.

<<say $companionCloud>>I wasn't a farmer, but sometimes during my travels, I'd find it useful to get something from them. So, I'd gently approach them, softly caress them from the side, and then help myself to the freshest possible milk while relieving their engorged udders.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Are you calling me a cow??<</say>>
Unexpectedly, the image of yourself in the same green pasture, with Cloud milking your udders, surfaces in your mind. The thought is more pleasant and far less offensive than you anticipated.

<<say $companionCloud>> Relax, I'm not calling you anything. I'm just saying I know how to help you.<</say>>
You contemplate his words and acknowledge that he has indeed been helpful thus far. Finally, Cloud expresses the last droplets of milk from your nipples with a bit more force, providing you with an indescribably satisfying release.

<<say $mc>><<if $IQdrop>20 >>HmmmMMMooooo! <<else>>Hmmmmmm! <</if>><</say>>
<<say $companionCloud>> That's what I thought. Remember, you know where to find me if you need relief again.<</say>>
He relinquishes his hold on your breasts, delivers a playful slap to your buttocks, and lets out a hearty laugh as he strolls away, leaving you to collect yourself.

You give Saeko a firm hug, after a few seconds of surprise she returns your hug limply.

<<say $mc>>I'm $mc.name, I'm happy to have you on the team with me.<</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>I can tell after that unusual greeting, you certainly seem very eager to get close to me.<</say>>
She speaks matter-of-factly, as if she were simply stating the sky was blue.

<<say $companionSaeko>>But I'm also glad to join you on this expedition. I think there will be some great opportunities down there and I'd like to see how well I can apply my theoretical knowledge.<</say>>

<<set $companionSaeko.affec-=(1-$hsswear)>>\
<<say $mc>>Yeah, I'm excited to discover all the magical wonders the Abyss has in store for us!<</say>>
She cocks an eyebrow as a response.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Magical wonders? You don't seem to understand the gravity of what we will be encountering in the Abyss. It is not that there are simply a series of 'magical' wondrous things that we can enjoy, it is an apparent gap in our understanding of the rules of the universe. Even the simplest of the Relics or Wonders we will observe in the Abyss simply break the rules that humans have held dear for hundreds of years. We need to rethink everything that we know about the universe. But they do follow their own rules, so they can be scientifically studied.<</say>>
Saeko seems to be getting more invested now, she begins speaking more enthusiastically about Abyssal research.

<<say $companionSaeko>>And while I don't expect to immediately understand why the Abyss does what it does, I think we can at least understand how it works on a surface level. How does Miasma alter developmental processes? How long have the species in the Abyss been evolving? Can we make use of the mutational effects of the miasma intentionally in a controlled manner, perhaps cure medical conditions? The potential is nearly limitless and we need to see what we can learn from it.<</say>>
Saeko continues to talk about recent advances in research regarding the Abyss and the immense potential that the Abyss has, if we could only understand it well enough to use it. You don't get much of a chance to speak, but it is very informative.

:: Saeko Convo0 MysteryTour
<<set $companionSaeko.affec+=(1+$hsswear)>>\
<<say $mc>>Yeah, I'm thrilled to dive into all the mysteries the Abyss holds!<</say>>
You see a twinkle in her eyes and the edges of her lips curl upwards.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Me too! I actually have a new theory about the effects of miasma on the flora and fauna native to the Abyss. I hypothesize that while some organisms display the effects of an acute mutation due to miasma exposure, others show an evolution over a long period of time in the Abyss. And I think if we can identify which species have evolved in the Abyss, then we can identify their most recent common ancestor with known surface species. If we do that, we can get a better understanding of what changes long-term colonization of the Abyss had on them and even when the species diverged!<</say>>
She blushes a bit, noticing she may be getting a bit carried away.

<<say $companionSaeko>>But yeah, you might not want to hear all about it. I understand. Suffice to say that I think there is a lot we can learn and I'm quite interested in learning it.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>No, please continue! I don't know if I'll be completely able to understand, but maybe it could be useful for the trip.<</say>>
Saeko smiles widely and perks up at your interest.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Well, if you say so. Anyway, I think that if we can see the common ancestors of Abyssal species to surface species, then we can create bounds on the age of the Abyss. Like if the flairabou of the 4th layer diverged from a surface mammal 500,000 years ago, then we can conclude the Abyss must be at least 500,000 years old. That's just an example, I haven't analyzed the flairabou yet. Though I hypothesize the oldest diverging species may be on the lower levels, so if we don't go deep enough then we won't be able to put an upper bound on the age of the Abyss. <</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>And also, we may be able to learn about how the Abyss alters the evolution of the species within. If we raised a flairabou outside the Abyss, would it have the same properties or does it rely on the miasma of the Abyss to mutate its body in a certain way to stay alive? Do we need to worry about Dune Devouring Borers colonizing the Sahara if someone brought them to the surface? Right now, no one knows, but I think these are important questions to ask and I hope that further analysis of Abyssal flora and fauna can provide answers to these questions.<</say>>
Saeko continues her explanation for a while, posing more questions, hypotheses, and experiments she'd like to do to test them. You can't quite follow everything she says, as she's clearly a better researcher than teacher, but she's glad you're paying attention and tries to explain anything you ask about.

She adjusts her glasses, looking flustered.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I see there's been a misunderstanding. You could be a tremendous asset for my PhD thesis. The miasma has imbued you with plant-like characteristics, and you undoubtedly share some traits with the local flora. However, this transformation is miasma-induced, not an evolutionary leap. You would be an excellent subject to cross-reference local flora characteristics against, in order to identify which traits have arisen due to environmental pressure and...<</say>>

<<say $companionSaeko>>Excellent! I shall wake you promptly at 6:45 AM, at which point you may consume precisely 250ml of fluids. Any delay in this schedule could put you at risk of dehydration, considering the prolonged period of fluid deprivation we experienced during the previous night. Following that...<</say>>
Saeko meticulously guides you through a comprehensive timetable, detailing every moment designated for fluid intake, urinary breaks, and rest. It seems your future holds a great deal of interaction with her.

<<say $mc>>Could we start from the beginning, please?<</say>><br>
<<say $companionSaeko>>Well, Maru asked about the origins of some of the local fauna. I began explaining the current theories about the interaction of surface life with miasma around the Abyss...<</say>><br>

<<say $companionMaru>>That's not how I said it. I was just wondering...<</say>><br>
<<say $companionSaeko>>And I took the time to explain it for you, but you just disregarded my explanation and insisted on your own instead.<</say>><br>
<<say $companionMaru>>But your explanation went over my head, and somewhere deep inside, I feel there's just some magic to it all, something beyond our understanding. Like maybe... it isn't really a scientific thing?<</say>><br>
Saeko turns to you, exasperation written all over her face.<br><br>
<<say $companionSaeko>>See? He refuses to even consider the facts and just fall back to "magic".<</say>><br>

:: Pulse Bloom Transformation[nobr]
You tenderly clutch the Pulse Bloom, drawing it closer to your face, as you take a deep breath, inhaling its crimson vapors. Your nostrils flare, savoring the intoxicatingly sweet and pungent scent. Yet, oddly, nothing seems to occur immediately. Exhaling, you proceed to draw in more of these ruby-hued emissions, until the Pulse Bloom has no more to offer. You stand there in quiet anticipation, but nothing appears to be taking place.<br>
Minutes trickle by, only for you to suddenly sense your heartbeat accelerating, each pulse resonating through your veins, making your blood buzz. You're seized by an alarming dizziness, and your body flushes with a heat that is almost too much to bear. Disoriented, you stagger, attempting to regain your balance when you feel the transformation seeping into you like ink in water.<br><br>

<<if $mc.heightCor < $PulseBloomStorage.heightCor>>
	Your perspective begins to warp, distorting like a reflection in a funhouse mirror. It's as if the world is towering around you, elongating and expanding. This is a disconcerting sensation, so you lower your gaze in an effort to ground yourself. But, as you do, it feels as though you're softly sinking into the earth, yet your feet remain anchored. Comprehension dawns - it isn't the world expanding; it's you, shrinking.<br><br>
<<elseif $mc.heightCor > $PulseBloomStorage.heightCor>>
	It seems as if the world around you is contracting, the familiar landscape appears to become a miniature set. This surreal experience compels you to fix your gaze downwards, to regain a sense of reality. However, as you do, you feel a gentle buoyancy, as if you're lifting away from the ground, even though you're still standing still. It takes a moment, but you finally realize, it's not the world shrinking. It's you, growing.<br><br>
<</if>>

<<if $mc.breastsCor > 0 && $PulseBloomStorage.breastsCor === 0>>
	The focal point of the warmth converges towards your nipples, and the surrounding areas. An irritating itch begins to take root, blossoming beneath your touch. You cup them instinctively, seeking relief, only to recoil in shock as your fingers meet with soft, pliable flesh. You knew that $PulseBloomUse had breasts, but the reality of their growth still leaves you agape.
<</if>>
<<if $mc.breastsCor > $PulseBloomStorage.breastsCor >>
	The heat intensifies around your breasts. As you pant from the strain of transformation, they chafe against the confines of your clothing. You cup them, trying to stabilize the shifting mass. To your astonishment, you can feel them swelling under your touch, slowly but surely. As you lean forward, you sense a new weight tugging at you, an unfamiliar heaviness that becomes more pronounced with each passing moment. Eventually, the growth seems to stall, leaving you clutching your $mc.breastsLabel cup breasts.<br><br>
<<elseif $mc.breastsCor < $PulseBloomStorage.breastsCor >>
	An enveloping warmth swells around your breasts. As you gasp from the strain of the transformation, they rasp uncomfortably against your clothing. You hold them, endeavoring to secure their shifting form. Startlingly, you can feel them retracting under your touch, as if sinking into your body. In alarm, you let them go. Yet, the usual tension that accompanies such a release is conspicuously absent, replaced by a peculiar lightness. Your breasts have indeed become smaller.
<</if>>
<<if $mc.breastsCor < $PulseBloomStorage.breastsCor && $mc.breastsCor !== 0>>
	When you gather the courage to touch them again, you find them reduced to a mere $mc.breastsLabel cup size.<br><br>
<<elseif $mc.breastsCor === 0 && $PulseBloomStorage.breastsCor > 0>>
	The process relentlessly continues until any sign of your breasts vanishes. You pat your chest in disbelief, almost as if in search of them. But they've disappeared, leaving you with nothing but a flat chest.<br><br>
<</if>>

<<if $mc.penisCor > 0 && $PulseBloomStorage.penisCor === 0>>
	A tantalizing tingling sensation originates in your crotch. As your attention diverts towards this stirring sensation, you are jolted by waves of pleasure. The sensation is reminiscent of someone rubbing your clit, almost causing your knees to buckle. You clutch at your groin instinctively, but find nothing amiss. Nevertheless, the sensation persists, forcing you to stifle a moan. You clutch your groin even tighter and are met with a surprising sensation, as if you're encasing your clit with your whole hand, but it's disconcertingly different. As you release your hold, you glimpse a bulge forming there. Incredibly, you're growing a penis!
<</if>>
<<if $mc.penisCor > $PulseBloomStorage.penisCor >>
	A wave of heat inundates your penis. It feels as though someone is gently pulling at it, a feeling both uncomfortable and tantalizingly arousing. It strains against the confines of your clothing, more and more as the transformation progresses. Eventually, a wave of pleasure washes over you, culminating in a mini climax, after which the sensations seem to ebb. When you gather the nerve to inspect it, you're presented with a $mc.penisCor inch penis.<br><br>
<<elseif $mc.penisCor < $PulseBloomStorage.penisCor >>
	A surge of warmth fills your penis. It feels as though a phantom hand is pushing against it, a sensation both discomforting and tantalizing. As the transformation progresses, the strain against your clothing dwindles.
<</if>>
<<if $mc.penisCor < $PulseBloomStorage.penisCor && $mc.penisCor !== 0>>
	Eventually, you're overcome by a mini orgasm, after which the sensations seem to dissipate. Looking down, you find your penis has receded to a mere $mc.penisCor inches.<br><br>
<<elseif $mc.penisCor === 0 && $PulseBloomStorage.penisCor > 0>>
	At some point, the sensation of being pushed grows more intense, it feels as though you're being penetrated. This intense sexual stimulation from within you is unsettling yet thrilling. Overwhelmed, you experience a mini orgasm, after which all sensations in your groin seem to retreat. Once you regain your breath and inspect your groin, you find nothing but a smooth, feminine mound between your legs.<br><br>

	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_sassy_talk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Don't worry, there's not much to be afraid of here. The only thing you need to worry about are some reports of bandits that ambush people coming back up from the second layer if they're carrying anything valuable.<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_grin.png">> <<say $companionAI>> But just like you, they're afraid of everything. If you're in a big group you should be fine. And if you seem intimidating enough they won't bother you, even in a small group. <</say>>

	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_sassy_talk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Anyway, a few of the Relics that are still here might have some use, though. The Rømer Stones, for example. They might seem useless by themselves, but their ability to absorb and release heat could be useful if you incorporate them into clothing from the surface.<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> Or maybe you like to take the Chain of Lorelei to make seem a little bit more feminine by changing your voice to melodic singers voice.<</say>>
	<<if $mc.osex==='male'>>
		<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_grin.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Although, if you want to achieve that effect you could also just take a handful of Blisshrooms and see what happens.<</say>>

		<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_grin.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Although some asset increases might also convince people of your femininity.<</say>>
	<</if>>
	<<say $mc>> Something tells me that that last piece of advice is less for helping me and more for your own entertainment. <</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_smirk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Maybe...<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_lecturing.png">> <<say $companionAI>>One other Relic that could be useful is the seemingly innocuous Star Compass. It seems silly to know what direction is down, but who knows what sort of weird scenarios you might find yourself in when you're exploring the Abyss.<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_lecturing.png">> <<say $companionAI>> The final Relic I have info on is a bit of an odd one though, the Creepy Doll. It seems a few people have taken it before, but somehow it always ended up back in the Abyss. There were a few groups that said it did absolutely nothing besides looking creepy, but others who were traveling by themselves and said that the doll 'kept them safe'. Although many of those divers disappeared from the record some time after making these statements...<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_plotting.png">>	<<say $companionAI>> If you ask me, I think those people might have been been delusional and probably just gave up. Reaching out to a doll to comfort them in the Abyss. I personally think it's probably useless, but you can check it out if you really want to.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>>Wow, once in a while you can be helpful!<</say>>

	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_smirk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Hmm, they're mostly pretty mild. You could even try taking all of them for some easy corruption.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Can you be serious for a second, Ai?<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_plotting.png">> <<say $companionAI>> To be honest, I was only half joking there. You need to be careful though, because while they are mild, they also won't give you much corruption.<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>>Pick up too many Relics and you'll be forced to go down a layer to get enough corruption to come back up, or wave goodbye to <<if $mc.breastsCor > 1 >>those nice huggable assets of yours<<elseif $mc.penisCor>1>>that fun tool between your legs<</if>>, since Shrunken Assets is the only Curse that will give a lot of corruption on this layer.<</say>>
	You gulp in apprehension at the thought.

	<<say $mc>> Thanks for the heads up.<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>>Oh also, if you take a Dizzying Heights Curse, your fate is sealed.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> What do you mean 'my fate is sealed'?<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>>I mean that you can't cheat the Abyss. If you choose to shrink, and then get rid of the Curse at the Icon of Mercy that's somewhere on this layer, the Abyss will remember and you'll continue to shrink in the future, no matter what the source of the change is.<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_mortified.png">> <<say $companionAI>>There are no second chances in the Abyss, so choose carefully!<</say>>

:: AI ConvoL1 Wonder
	<<say $mc>> Can you give me some more information on any wonders on this layer?<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> The Icon of Mercy can be found on this layer and it will allow you to get rid of a single Curse and give up the corruption you gained. But be careful, you can only use it one time!<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> So it basically a refund?<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> Yes, exactly!<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Well, that doesn't sound too useful unless I make a bad choice with a Curse I don't want.<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_lecturing.png">> <<say $companionAI>> First of all, we are on the very first layer. Of course the wonder is not going to be some omnipotent marvel...<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> And second of all, there are more reasons than simple regret. <</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_lecturing.png">> <<say $companionAI>>Some divers get random inflictions of Curses from the Abyss. So it can be very helpful to get rid of such unwanted Curses. But you could also strategize around using a Curse temporarily.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Why would I do that?<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> Some Curses could give you a benefit while exploring the Abyss, even if you'd want to get rid of it later, not all Curses are purely negative.<</say>>

	<<say $mc>> That's actually not a bad strategy, but it does require me to move back up again... Thanks Ai, I'll keep it in mind for when it's convenient. Anything else?<</say>>

	<<say $mc>> Can you give me some information on any Wonders on this layer?<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> Sure! There are two here, but I guess it might be a little late to give you info on the Empty-handed Broker, so that leaves us with the Fate-Crossing Star's pond. If you enter it then you'll wake up as somebody else entirely! It will always be one of your traveling companions though.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Uh... that sounds as intrusive as it gets. I don't think anyone would be happy if I did that<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_plotting2.png">> <<say $companionAI>> You bet they would be pissed, but what will they do? Go back up alone and leave their original body behind? I don't think you need to worry about them leaving you if you're in their body.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> You can be pretty scary, you know... What would I even get if I change bodies?<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_excited_excited.png">> <<say $companionAI>> First of all, you get corruption for it. Beside that there are loads of other options with it, but the most important one is the possible gender swap!<</say>>
	You sigh, recognizing the obvious pattern in the topics Ai seems to enjoy.

	<<say $mc>> I get the feeling, you're more personally interested in switching my gender than any way it would help me in the Abyss. I don't know know if I'd want to risk the ire of my companions for your pleasure.<</say>>

	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_lecturing.png">> <<say $companionAI>> On the other hand, there isn't any information in my database that says the Fate-Crossing Star can't use virtual body. Maybe it could be possible...<</say>>

You swallow nervously as AI continues.

<<say $companionAI>>Slimes lurk within these shadowy passages.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> But aren't slimes usually easy to defeat? We could gain experience from them!<</say>>

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_lecturing.png">> <<say $companionAI>>You wouldn't be the first adventurer to be ensnared by them without enough water or food, and if that happens, it's game over for you!<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Game over? I thought you just told me not to treat this like a game.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_annoyed.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Fine. Don't take this seriously and see what happens. Anyway, I'd advise you to bring a light source so you can avoid them more easily.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Yeah, sorry, and thanks! Anything else I should know?<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_lecturing.png">><<say $companionAI>> There's also a tentacle beast roaming around that can cripple you to the point where traveling becomes painfully slow, causing you to encounter it more frequently. <</say>>
<<say $mc>> So, it's better to fight it off, then?<</say>>
<<say $companionAI>> Yes, but be cautious about how you approach the fight. If you try to take it down with a gun, you might find yourself quickly running out of bullets.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> So, a sword would be better?<</say>>
<<say $companionAI>> That's a wiser choice, but make sure you have enough medkits on hand.<</say>>

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_sassy_talk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> The first Relic I'd suggest for someone like you is the Sibyl Blend. It shortens your travel time when searching for other Relics, so you'll quickly make up for the time spent finding it.<</say>>

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_annoyed.png">> <<say $companionAI>> First of all, I wasn't finished, <<mrms>> impatient. Secondly, I don't know... maybe convince one of your companions that you're more like their preferred partner?<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Well, we'll see about that. Anyway, tell me about the powerful Relics already!<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_bummed.png">> <<say $companionAI>> You really are impatient, you know that?<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_neutral_happy.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Moving on to the powerful Relics, then. Lightning Rook and Breathless Exhale are formidable Relics on their own and could help you in a fight. However, there's one with even more potential.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Enough with the suspense, just tell me already.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_annoyed.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Jeez, how many times do I have to call you impatient before it sinks in?<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_excited_excited.png">> <<say $companionAI>> But I was talking about Managed Misfortune. It allows you to store a curse and activate or deactivate it at will.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> How is an extra Curse going to help me?<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_sassy_talk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Well, imagine turning yourself gooey in an instant so the slime monsters in this layer bother you less.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Hmm, that might actually not be a bad idea.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_excited_excited.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Or transform into a giant the moment somebody threatens you.<</say>>
<<if $visitL7 === 0>>
	<<say $mc>> Are there Curses that could do that?<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> You bet! There are curses that can do that. Not only do the Relics become more powerful the deeper we go.<</say>>
<<else>>
	<<say $mc>> Wait a minute, you're right! This would work perfectly with the Curses from the deeper layers.<</say>>

<<say $mc>> What do you mean?<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_smirk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Well for starters, everyone has a compatible type of bed partner.

		<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_bummed.png">> <<say $companionAI>> It was just a joke.<</say>>

	<</if>>
<</if>>
<<say $mc>> But that's just two curses.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_smirk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Yes, so there's also Equal Opportunity, which, if transferred to a partner, would make them a little less picky about their preferred type of bed partner.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> I thought these curses were supposed to be detrimental. This sounds more like Cupid lost his spell book.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_sassy_talk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> I think he used arrows.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> You get what I mean; there's a matchmaker theme going on here.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_smirk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> And you don't even know the half of it. Remember what happens after two people fall in love? They start a family.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Wait, start a family... what do you mean exactly?<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_smirk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Let's just say that acquiring Wacky Wombs or taking on Absolute Pregnancy will drastically increase your chance of ending up with your own little kids.<</say>>

	<<say $mc>> Hold on, so I can get a womb and get pregnant?<</say>>

<</if>>

<<say $mc>>Well, I didn't say I never wanted kids.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_drooling.png">> <<say $companionAI>> In that case, just take the Omnitool curse, and I'll start scanning the area for one of these tentacle monsters willing to help us.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>No, no, please don't!<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_grin.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Relax, I'm just messing with you, <<if $mc.sex === "male">>brother<<else>>sister<</if>>.<</say>>

	<<say $mc>>Wait, I can do that? Why would they accept, though?<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_smirk.png">><<say $companionAI>> The same reason you took on some of the Curses here real easy. Everybody got their own desires, and some might be just as pervy as yours!<</say>>

You listen, intrigued.

<<say $companionAI>>Drifting swallowers earned their name for a reason. If you can't keep them at a safe distance with ranged weapons, they’ll try to swallow you whole.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>That sounds seriously dangerous!<</say>>
<<say $companionAI>>Dangerous, yes, but fortunately not fatal. Their digestion is notoriously inefficient. You'd survive, though you'd emerge a little worse for wear.<</say>>

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_mortified.png">> <<say $companionAI>> The true danger, the spectre of the end, is something else entirely. It's as ominous as it sounds.<</say>>

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_neutral_happy.png">><<say $companionAI>>For the Brave Vector, a few modifications in the workshop should do the trick.

<<say $mc>>That sounds useful for combat. Are there Relics that help outside of battle?<</say>>

:: Forbidden Grimoire Select
[img[setup.ImagePath+"Relics/forbiddengrimoire.png"]]
A grisly-looking ragged book written in an indecipherable language. Words can only be seen on the page when a person reads it alone, and they vanish as that one person reads them. This will take whatever skills the reader possesses and improve them greatly, leaving a blank, non-useful book behind. Mechanically speaking, if you let a companion use it, it would double the specific numeric benefit of their special ability - Khemia would reduce travel costs by 4 days, Cloud would redduce bullet costs by 4 (minimum 1), Cherry would reduce status effect lengths by2, and so on. (It doesn't really affect, say, Khemia's ability to slay monsters so much - he's already trained to nearly the maximum human limits, and if there's a monster he can't defeat, it's more about the monster simply being durable beyond the human body's limits than it is about any imperfections in his fighting sills.) Using it on yourself could help you in your normal life, but probably not very much on your journey - the benefit would be substantially less than that from using it on a companion, anyways. If one person were to read it twice (such as through Kin Shifter), the second use would have no benefit - best to spread it out among multiple companions.

It's useless once it's been used once of course, so choose wisely who will get the benefit.

Who do you want to give the grimoire to improve their skills?

While Maru great appreciates your gift and improves the taste of his cooking, you don't gain any material benefit on your journey from giving it to him.

:: Forbidden Grimoire Saeko
After reading from the book, Saeko looks a bit sad as she turns the last page, as if hoping there was more to learn. After that, she is able to use innovative techniques you've never seen before to minimize your exposure to the miasma whenever possible. You now subtract 10 from all corruption costs in the Abyss, rather than 5.\

<<say $companionMaru>>I love how pretty the flowers are here, and just look at those glowing mushrooms! I bet they're really tasty. Thanks for taking me along, this is fun.<</say>>
Maru spreads his arms and whirls in a circle. It doesn't raise your confidence in his ability to face some of the dangers that are supposedly down here, but you smile in spite of yourself. It's nice to have someone cheerful along on the journey.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 1

<<say $companionLily>>This part of the Abyss is alright, but it's not my favorite. There's just not enough going on. Yes, it's pretty, but it also gets kind of boring unless you brought along a hang-glider or a kayak.<</say>>
Lily looks at you and glances over the equipment you're carrying, sees no evidence that you brought any extreme sport equipment, and then sighs. 

<<say $companionLily>>There might be a couple Relics that are useful to you here, but in general the Relics in this part aren't that valuable. I don't know, this layer is just not really my cup of tea. If you want to hang around here, we can, but I'd rather we went somewhere with more going on. Ideally some good music. Do you know the song that goes like...<</say>>
Lily starts humming and occasionally bursts out into full blown singing. This might not be her favorite part of the Abyss, but in spite of that, she seems to be having a good time.	
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 1

Khemia is smiling and nodding as he takes in the landscape around you. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>It feels great to be back down here. This layer is pretty nice. There are some bandits who try to steal Relics from people coming back up, and supplies from people coming down, but they're not so tough. If you brought a weapon, just hand it to me, and I'll take care of them. You'd think they'd get strong stealing Relics from exhausted parties, but you'd be wrong. They're pretty incompetent and I don't think they can ever pick up any of the really strong Relics.<</say>>
Khemia's grin is infectious, and he strides forward, leaping up onto the top of a nearby rock. It's clear he's in his element here.
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 1

<<say $companionCherry>>This place is okay. It reminds me of some things I thought I'd forgotten.<</say>>
Cherry's eyes are focused out in the distance. You decide that now isn't the time to press her on what she meant.
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 1

<<say $companionCloud>>There are some people who live down on this layer who seem pretty decent. They've made a town, and are living in harmony. We've got bigger plans and responsibilities though and the real secrets of this place are further down. Let's keep moving.<</say>>
You find yourself marveling at his confident charm. Did you hire him to help with your adventure, or did you just pay him for the privilege of coming along on his?
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 1

<<say $companionSaeko>>The miasma in this layer isn't very dense, but it can concentrate under certain conditions. Some of the water has concentrated miasma in it, and there are some plants and fungi that hyper-accumulate the miasma.<</say>> 
She gestures at a glowing mushroom on the side of the path as she speaks.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Initially I thought it was a defensive mechanism, but that doesn't make sense when most of the organisms in the Abyss can tolerate miasma quite well and even incorporate it into their own life cycles. It's not my primary area of study, but perhaps someday I'll get to do some experiments on it. I'd love to understand why some species accumulate the miasma so much more than others.<</say>>
Then she suddenly looks a little bit self conscious and starts muttering.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Errr... sorry, sometimes I can't help myself.<</say>>
Despite her apology it's clear that she's hoping you also care about this stuff.
<br>
:: Maru Layer 2

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/MaruL2.png']]

<<say $companionMaru>>Berries!<</say>>
Maru jumps up and down with excitement at the sight of the small, sweet fruits. He seems to be loving the forest down here, since he's constantly laughing about various plants. This is certainly a grand adventure to him.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 2

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/LilyL2.png']]

<<say $companionLily>>Slippery when wet!<</say>>
 Lily shouts and laughs as she slides down a slick rock. When she lands, she smiles at you. 

 <<say $companionLily>>And down here, absolutely everything is wet.<</say>>
 She casually flicks a drop of water out of your hair, then she steps backwards and does a cartwheel over a large root jutting into the path. Unconcerned that her hands just got covered in mud, she runs them through the vegetation on either side of the narrow path you're following, cleaning them off, mostly. You pause for a second, then ask 

<<if $mc.conversationHandicap === 0>>\
	<<say $mc>>Who maintains this path anyway?<</say>>
	She laughs at the question for a moment before she answers. 

	<<say $companionLily>>Maintains? Nobody maintains it. There are a bunch of them down here. They're made by wandering adventurers like us, or maybe the Abyss just makes them on its own, or maybe they're just a bunch of Baying Gourmet trails.<</say>>
	You stop in your tracks, suddenly getting nervous. She looks back at you and rolls her eyes.

	<<say $companionLily>>Oh, they're out there, but there's no point in getting all scared. We're in this together. We'll face what comes, and we shall triumph!<</say>>
	She pumps her fist in the air, and expertly slides down another root, vanishing into a rustle of leaves as the path turns. You're not sure if Lily is one of the bravest people you've ever met, or just one of the craziest. You're glad you're not alone down here though.	
<</if>>\
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 2

<<say $companionKhemia>>When I first started coming down here, I just tried running over all these plants. Ha, I fell on my face a few times when my foot got snagged. There's a trick to it, winding your way through them, lopping off anything blocking the best path forward.<</say>>
He looks towards you and launches into a tale. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>There was one time when a Baying Gourmet jumped one of my party members. An on that dive, the party leader was a cheapskate who hadn't brought along a sword or any other weapons. I got lucky and dodged its claws and somehow was able to jump on its back, but the damn thing took off with me on top of it! I hung on, not wanting it to get loose and turn on me, and managed to ride it for what must have been at least a kilometer, up and down multiple trees, it was a blast. Eventually it just whimpered and laid down in the mud.<</say>>
He smiles broadly, clearly pleased at his impressive escapade.

<<say $companionKhemia>>So I left it there, but when I tracked down the rest of my party, they'd hardly moved at all! Initiative, that's the biggest thing that sets the good explorers apart from the bad ones. So don't get rattled, just do what needs to be done, and if I should get hauled away, do try to come find me.<</say>>
Khemia smirks, and continues leading the way through the thick foliage.	
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 2

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/CherryL2.png']]

<<say $companionCherry>>I like the rain down here. The mist, the plants, all of it... It's peaceful.<</say>>
The forest may strike some people as a bit unnerving, but you're glad that at least Cherry is finding some solace in it.	
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 2

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/CloudL2.png']]

<<say $companionCloud>>I think you might find a Relic on this layer that could enhance your abilities as a leader. There are some who claim that it's better to be feared than loved, but I've never agreed with that precept. If we are to make the world a better place, we must do it through love.<</say>>
The gently falling drops of water seem to bounce off Cloud's hair, and his footing never falters on the wet ground. You can't quite explain how he manages to maintain such calm poise in a jungle like this, but he does, and his presence is reassuring.	
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 2

<<say $companionSaeko>>I love this place.<</say>>
There's a look of eager wonder in Saeko's eyes as she examines the flora around you. The mist and dripping condensation remind you of a phrase you once heard: 'where there is water, there is life'. Saeko certainly seems energized by the quantity of slightly exotic biomass around you. She occasionally stoops down to take a small sample or examine one of the organisms you're passing along the journey. Every now and then she points to an insect, slug, or flower and mentions something about its genus and species or stares in wonder because she doesn't know what it is.

There is something endearing about her passionate curiosity. Sometimes it seems to you that her mind is a place of indexed facts, almost robotic in its logic, but other times the full vitality of a lively brilliance shines through her normally controlled demeanor. It's good she's excited, but you also hope her sample collecting doesn't slow you down too much.
<br>
:: Maru Layer 3

<<say $companionMaru>>You know, these dark caves aren't my favorite place. I always feel like something is going to come out of the darkness and grab me.<</say>>
His normally enthusiastic attitude has turned to muted anxiety. Maybe you shouldn't linger in the darkness of these caves for too long.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 3

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/LilyL3.png']]

<<say $companionLily>>This place is a mixed bag. One the one hand, it's so dark and gloomy that it's sure to drive you bonkers. On the other hand, the echoes are totally sweet.<</say>>
She raises her voice and sings a few notes, making the caverns send the echoes back to you, producing an oscillating set of musical chords that is both beautiful and unnerving. It's also way too loud! You look at her wide-eyed with alarm, not sure what is out there that might have just heard her in the dark. She laughs and pats you on the shoulder.

<<say $companionLily>>Don't worry, you've got me, and I'm sure we'll be fine. Might as well have a bit of fun, or you'll be bonkers in no time.<</say>>
You close your eyes briefly, thinking that the stress of her echoing voice isn't helping much, but then you breathe. Whatever comes will come. It doesn't lessen the dark and oppressive nature of the stone around you, but somehow the exchange makes you feel a little bit better about it. Lily might act carefree, but she knows what she's doing, hopefully.
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 3

<<say $companionKhemia>>They say you can't map the Abyss, and this is true, but if you come down here enough you begin to get a feel for it. You start to recognize things, like the curvature of a particular stalagmite or the patterns of the echoes. I couldn't draw you a map of these caves, but I can help you find your way through them and back out again.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 3

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/CherryL3.png']]

<<say $companionCherry>>It's very dark here. I'm not afraid of the dark or anything, but... the darkness leaves us alone in our thoughts. Stay close, this is not the kind of place we want to get lost or separated.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 3

<<say $companionCloud>>Perception and thought are the key to overcoming most obstacles. The darkness here obscures some helpful things, and some dangerous ones. Staying calm and alert will see us through any of the challenges we face here.<</say>>
Cloud smiles at you, and the darkness feels a bit less oppressive.
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 3

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/SaekoL3.png']]

<<say $companionSaeko>>The macroscopic biodiversity is lower on this layer of the Abyss, but there are still some thriving fungi, a few animals, and lots of microbes. My knowledge of what is deeper down starts to get pretty scant, but this layer is still fairly well-documented. There are a few protists that I've heard form communities down here and do some fascinating things. If I only could manage to get a sample...<</say>>
She trails off, then nods her head. 

<<say $companionSaeko>>Lead on, I'll be right behind you.<</say>>
She gives you a somewhat nervous smile. You're not entirely reassured, but continue on your way through the seemingly endless caverns.
<br>
:: Maru Layer 4

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/MaruL4.png']]

Maru throws a snowball at you, laughing. 

<<say $companionMaru>>This place is fun!<</say>>
You brush some powdered snow out of your hair, and raise an eyebrow at him. Lately his cooking has been exceptional, but you're surprised how well he's holding up. Then a chill wind whistles through the pass, carrying a sense of foreboding with it. Maru looks around nervously that hurries closer to you, huddling in on himself against the cold. You force yourself to smile at him, despite your own unease and he gives a nervous smile back.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 4

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/LilyL4.png']]

A snowflake lands on a Lily's hair. She responds with an exasperated half-smile before blowing a jet of air at it. You watch as the snowflake rejoins the wind and floats away. Normally you can't get her to stop talking, but here she's uncharacteristically quiet sometimes. The crunch of your footsteps through the snowy path is strange, like multiple little pops. Lily's thoughts seem to be mirroring your own.

<<say $companionLily>>Do you think any of this snow ever melts? I'd guess not, but if it doesn't, how deep does it go?<</say>>
There's a pause while you both worry about falling down into a 100 meter snowdrift or a hidden crevice in the ice. Then Lily seems to come back to herself, a true smile once again upon her face as she begins chattering and looks up at the icy peaks that tower above you. In this frozen landscape, she's a good friend to have.
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 4

Khemia stands atop a rock jutting out of the snow and ice peering into the distance. A chill wind whips around him, but he seems unfazed.

<<say $companionKhemia>>There's a foe that lurks on this layer that I cannot touch. Almost everything in the Abyss stays on its own layer, but not this one. It doesn't bother those of us with the purity gene, but you're in danger, and neither I nor anyone else can protect you. From here on out, it would be wise not to dither too much.<</say>>
Snow whips around both of you in this barren landscape of rock and ice. Sometimes Khemia is reassuring or awe inspiring, and sometimes he's a bit frightening. His advice is probably sound though, as you do feel like something dark is watching you more intently each day you spend here.
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 4

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/CherryL4.png']]

Cherry trudges along a bit behind you, but the snow doesn't seem to bother her. In fact, she seems to hardly notice the cold. Her breath condenses into small clouds that part around her face. She briefly meets your eyes and gives you a small smile. You're not sure how she conveys so much with a simple expression, but you sense that she's more at peace down here, trudging through the snow, than she has been in some time.
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 4

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/CloudL4.png']]

<<say $companionCloud>>The glaciers here tell a story, a tale of countless snows beyond measure. This place has never known the warmth of spring. In some ways it is akin to the world above; harsh, unforgiving, where life is a struggle for most, and even those who aren't struggling are afraid that they might fall, and struggle again. I do not know what force makes this layer of the Abyss the way it is, but my instincts tell me that one who could bring peace and prosperity to a place like this, could also heal the world above.<</say>>
Cloud stares out at the frozen peaks and deep chasms in this frigid place. 

<<say $companionCloud>>Could one with a sufficiently warm heart thaw even this ice, or would the attempt merely freeze their heart? There is power in the cold, but it is not kind, and is ill-suited for bringing joy to anyone.<</say>>
Normally Cloud radiates confidence, but here he seems wistful, or even worried. His reveries are probably not useful to the task at hand though, and after a few more moments he returns to walking. Deep truths will wait for now, there are Relics to find and places to go.
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 4

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/SaekoL4.png']]

<<say $companionSaeko>>Negative fourteen degrees C.<</say>>
Saeko sighs, apparently measuring the temperature once again, as you have seen her do many times while here.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I don't understand it. No matter where we go in this layer, it's negative fourteen degrees C. It's like there's some giant thermostat carefully maintaining the temperature. Even if I insulate the thermostat, it read negative fourteen degrees C.<</say>>
She shakes her head. 

<<say $companionSaeko>>The algae in these glaciers have processed the miasma in such a way that they make things ingesting them bigger or smaller, but why, and how? Where does the mass even come from? Where does it go?<</say>>
Saeko is apparently frustrated, but then a spark comes into her eyes.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Ah, unrelated, but I have a hypothesis to test. The drifting swallowers on this layer, big floaty things that try to eat you, some previous researchers thought they used hydrogen or helium to keep themselves afloat, but I think it's simpler than that. I think they're just heating the air in the gasseous sacks with their body temperature. I bet they've got blood vessels that contract and expand around those sacks to regulate how buoyant they are by the temperature of the air inside them, and thus how much they expand. It's just like a hot air balloon, only... they try to eat you. There might be a way to use that to our advantage.<</say>>
<br>
:: Maru Layer 5

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/MaruL5.png']]

<<say $companionMaru>>Flowers and sand!<</say>>
Maru is shouting in frustration, when he suddenly slips on some loose flower petals and falls on his behind. But that doesn't stop his complaints.

<<say $companionMaru>>Sand and flowers, flowers and sand. Everything is flowers and sand!<</say>>
You find yourself agreeing with him. His outburst might not be especially insightful, but you understand his exasperation. At first this flowery sandy desert was a lot of fun to walk through, but now it's just tiring. All the flowers start to look the same after a while, and all the petals that blow across the dunes are dry. Every now and then interesting rocky outcroppings peek out of the sand, but for the most part, in spite of the flowers, the terrain is painfully monotonous. Here you are, in the middle of this vast plain of sand beneath a bright "sky" that seems like it shouldn't be there... You're pretty sure you're actually beneath the planet's crust right now, aren't you? What exactly is going on here?
<br>
:: Lily Layer 5

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/LilyL5.png']]

<<say $companionLily>>Okay, I'm officially tired of walking through all this sand. I'm tired of these stupid flowers too.<</say>>
Lily spits out a petal that floated into her mouth as she complains.

<<say $companionLily>>Look, I get it, we've got to keep moving, but seriously we should figure out how to ride one of those Dune Devouring Borers, because they seem like they can move way faster.<</say>>
You give Lily a meaningful look, but she doesn't relent.

<<say $companionLily>>No, I'm serious, it would be fun, and efficient; it's a good idea.<</say>>
You'll have to think about how you might attempt such a thing the next time a Dune Devouring Borer attacks your party, but it doesn't seem like something you'd be able to do easily.
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 5

<<say $companionKhemia>>This is as deep as I've ever gone in past dives. The desert is huge, and often deadly and the Relics are often hidden in trapped passages and tombs. Most explorer parties that venture into the Abyss turn back before this point, and many that make it this far make it back up.<</say>>
Khemia sighs as he looks out at the landscape of unforgiving sands.

<<say $companionKhemia>>I once accompanied a man named Phillip, he was a pretty good leader, but this desert was the death of him.<</say>>
Khemia gestures around at the scorching, inhospitable sands, then gives you a very direct look.

<<say $companionKhemia>>The most important part of my job is to try to get you back out of this place alive. Make sure you have enough supplies, and if you get hurt, use a medkit. If something goes badly wrong, consider settling rather than dying. This desert has its own kind of peace, and even though it's not where I'd want to spend the rest of my life, it's better than losing the rest of your life to death.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 5

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/CherryL5.png']]

<<say $companionCherry>>It's too bright here<</say>>
Cherry squints against the light as she complains.

<<say $companionCherry>>That's not even really the sun. Ugh... nevermind, it's not important. Let's just keep going.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 5

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/CloudL5.png']]

<<say $companionCloud>>A trillion petals fly across this desert made of dreams, but now we're far beneath the earth and naught is what it seems. We must swim across this ocean of slow moving waves of sand, to find some precious Relics that can help restore our land. Threats rise up to greet us for they know not why we've come, but none can stand against us beneath this artificial sun.<</say>>
Cloud sighs deeply, breathing in the dry desert air.

<<say $companionCloud>>Sometimes words help us, but not always. This journey has brought us far, let us make it worth the trip.<</say>>
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 5

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/SaekoL5.png']]

<<say $companionSaeko>>How are there all these flowers with so little water? Normal flowers are extremely delicate, the petals are turgid with water pressure, the process of pollination and seed development is extremely vulnerable to drought-like conditions, the anthers and stigma require sufficient water for the process to work. These flowers though, they're everywhere, but they don't actually have any reproductive organs on them. They're not doing what flowers are supposed to do. On top of that, they're practically anhydrous.<</say>>
Saeko runs her fingers through her hair as she paces back and forth.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I don't get it. I've taken careful notes, and the physiology indicates there are at least 17 species of these flowers down here, really just flowers, slender stalks supporting petals with no roots to speak of, and they're clearly reproducing like mad, but there's no water in them, and they're not even engaging in any kind of reproduction I understand. Are they vegetatively propagating? Are the petals themselves a means of tissue separation and dispersal? I've heard there might be a research facility in this vast desert somewhere, have they figured out what's going on here?<</say>>
She seems to mostly be talking to herself, but eventually her eyes lock on yours.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I don't know how these pseudo-flowers are doing what they're doing, but you and I, we need water. Our cells are full of water, they only work because they're full of water. You're the leader here. Make sure we've got enough water, and for goodness sake, do not let us get eaten by one of those giant worms.<</say>>
<br>
:: Maru Layer 6

<<say $companionMaru>>No, nonono, I said NO you stupid tentacle!<</say>>
Maru shouts, repeatedly kicking at one of the many tentacles that keeps trying to climb up his skirt. You look back at him with some sympathy. Not far away you can see the river Dycx, and you hear the rumbling of a flock of Omen Eyes. Every now and then you have come across a deep pit that curves down under the land. Even the walls of those pits have been lined in tentacles. Eventually Maru stops attacking the tentacle and rushes to catch up with you.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 6

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/LilyL6.png']]

<<say $companionLily>>Well this is different.<</say>>
Lily speaks with a rye smile on her face.

<<say $companionLily>>I'd heard a couple stories, but I've never actually talked with anyone who's gone this deep before. To think, hell is just full of a bunch of perverted tentacles. It's quite a sight to...<</say>>
She brushes another questing tentacle away from her thigh...

<<say $companionLily>>Feel.<</say>>
She rolls her eyes, then looks into the distance at a great roaring fire that's searing part of the vast tentacle fields a kilometer away.

<<say $companionLily>>Let's also try to avoid getting burned. This place is super weird, but hey, sometimes you've just gotta roll with it.<</say>>
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 6

Khemia has been acting strangely ever since you got here. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>Wow, I still can't believe we've actually made it. I've heard stories, but... I finally got a leader with the ambition and ability to plunge this deep. It's exciting.<</say>>
He grins at you, but then his expression becomes a bit more uncertain.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's also a bit much at first. All the earlier layers I've had experience on, but this place is weirder than I thought it would be.<</say>>
His eyes seem to gain a glint as he looks at the surroundings.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Don't worry though, we've got this. The same skills that brought us this far will see us through whatever we face next. I do think we should be careful about spending too much time here unless we can find some way to deal with these tentacles though. The ones burning with multicolored flames seem pretty sinister.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 6

Cherry looks around skeptically at the endless fields of writhing tentacles, and burning tentacles, and slowly shifting infernos that leave behind only ash. She sighs.

<<say $companionCherry>>Lead the way.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 6

A calculating look comes over Cloud's face as he whispers.

<<say $companionCloud>>Here there be dragons.<</say>>
He glances across the landscape and seems to take it in.

<<say $companionCloud>>It's not enough though. There are powerful Relics here in this disturbing place, but I think we'd need to go deeper. We'll also need to find a way to deal with some of the hexed magic we're already being exposed to. If we don't, the longer we stay here the more it will slow us down, and it will be unpleasant to boot.<</say>>
He gives you a very direct look.

<<say $companionCloud>>Unless you're especially fond of tentacles, we need to get back to the surface, and we need to survive the attempt. Don't forget our purpose, and don't underestimate the danger, but I can feel it in my bones that there's something important deeper down.<</say>>
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 6

Saeko shies away from a particularly vigorous tentacle in the path and shakes her head.

<<say $companionSaeko>>This is very weird.<</say>>
You look at her in surprise. Normally Saeko is full of detailed observations and theories, but not today. You ask her what's wrong, and she just shakes her head again.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Look, I don't have an explanation for burning fields of tentacles. I thought the tentacle beasts we saw earlier might have been related to surface cephalopods, but now that seems much less likely. They probably share some common ancestor with these... field tentacles, but I have no idea what that would be. And I really don't like walking around this infernal place that doesn't even have a single plant, but I'll do my best to keep us protected from the effects of the miasma while we're down here. I'm just going to focus on that for right now.<</say>>
<br>
:: Maru Layer 7

<<say $companionMaru>>I almost like this place, but with all this advanced technology, all they have are the same barely-edible vending machine rations. It's really not much to work with.<</say>>
Maru shakes his head, looking indignant at the culinary limitations of this city.

<<say $companionMaru>>I'll tell you, robots just don't appreciate good food. Whoever built them must have given up and left out of sheer boredom from eating these same terrible rations day in and day out. There are no mushrooms, no berries, not even a rat. What kind of a city doesn't even have rats?<</say>>
<br>
:: Lily Layer 7

Lily looks quizzically at the city around you.

<<say $companionLily>>It just seems silly, you know? Why all these buildings? Why are there these jobs? What are all these robots even doing? Taxes? Taxes in the Abyss? It just seems so ridiculous.<</say>>
You give her a sideways smile, she does have a point, but she's not done... alas, Lily is never, ever done talking.

<<say $companionLily>>Why on earth do robots need houses? Couldn't they all just power down and be content? Now mind you, I've never been a robot, and I don't think I'd want to be one, because being a robot sounds insufferably boring, but if I were a robot, I'd have a hard time rationalizing my programming that was telling me to do all these ridiculous things that make no sense. Move rocks around? Paint stuff? You're a robot, just program yourself to be satisfied with the way things are. Unless... do you think it's the Abyss that's programming them somehow? Wait, I have an idea, we could program them to play music. I don't know how to do that, but it would be super fun. Do you have any Relics that could make all these silly robots sing a song together? No? Ah... that's okay.<</say>>
The monologue never ends...
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 7

Khemia looks a bit shaken.

<<say $companionKhemia>>This place... I've never even imagined anything like this.<</say>>
He looks down at his hands and almost seems to tremble for a moment.

<<say $companionKhemia>>What good is swordsmanship against limitless armies of metal machines?<</say>>
You try to cheer him up a bit, but he just shakes his head.

<<say $companionKhemia>>There's some impressive stuff here, but to me, this all just feels a bit wrong. I thought I knew what the Abyss was about, but the deeper we go, the less sure I am.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 7

<<say $companionCherry>>It's frozen.<</say>>
<<if $mc.conversationHandicap === 0>>\
	<<say $mc>>What?<</say>>
<<else>>\
	You try to make clear you don't understand what she means.
<</if>>\

<<say $companionCherry>>This place. It looks alive, but it isn't. All these robots, they move, but they're also frozen. Everything here is waiting, waiting for a day that will never come.<</say>>
Her tone is hollow, but this is more than Cherry usually says. Somehow, deep down, you know that she has spoken a truth.
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 7

<<say $companionCloud>>Yes, this is the place. But, where are they? The ones who designed and created this, where have they gone? Their machines still whir about, but... could it be that they are no more?<</say>>
Cloud is unusually agitated, still in command of himself, but not exactly calm.

<<say $companionCloud>>Regardless, the technology here, the power here, this could change the world. Between the Relics on this layer and the ones on the upper layers, it's possible for us to do something big. Let's gather what we can.<</say>>
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 7

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/SaekoL7.png']]

<<say $companionSaeko>>To think, this has been down here, all this technology, all this power, and we didn't even know. How long has it been like this? Is this an evolving robotic society, or just... no, it doesn't seem like it. These systems, they lack something vital about them. They're artificial, not organic.<</say>>
You ask her how she knows. She gives you a faint smile.

<<say $companionSaeko>>It's just a hypothesis, I don't have the experimental data I'd really need to justify that conclusion, but just look at the robots. They're mass produced, you can tell. Look at how they move. Those movements are a result of programming, not a biological intelligence that's making subtle mistakes and correcting them. Have you ever really watched a colony of ants? Ants are pretty alien to us, their thinking is strange, their movements are strange, but even ants display far more characteristics of life in their actions that any of these robots do. Ant brains are simple, but they still think. It's different from calculation. These robots, none that I've seen seem to be displaying indications of actual thought.<</say>>
<br>
:: Maru Layer 8

<<say $companionMaru>>I feel like we're at a tea party inside a doll house, but that the person throwing the tea party isn't very nice.<</say>>
You look over at Maru, he's dealing with all of this better than you'd have expected.

<<say $companionMaru>>My sisters used to have tea parties with me when I was young, they taught me how to make crumpets and scones, they gave me lessons on properly preparing the tea, and manners... I really miss them. Being down here, it reminds me of all the fun we had. They were really nice. They weren't perfect or anything, everyone has flaws, but they tried to be nice. I think that whoever is throwing this tea party doesn't understand kindness or love. Still, we're down here together, I'll do my best to make up for what they were missing.<</say>>
<br>
:: Lily Layer 8

<<say $companionLily>>I've got to tell you, when we first came down here I thought that all this crazy space-warping architecture would drive me nuts. However, I'm starting to like it. Oh, don't get me wrong, this place is totally screwed up, creepy puppet things lurking around corners, weird nightmares, endless hallways of rooms that are all just a bit too eerie, but you know, it's also kind of fun. Sure this place is all messed up, but it's our adventure. I've never heard of anyone who actually came down this far before, and as explorers, we're pretty cool.<</say>>
Lily puffs out her chest and strikes a pose of supreme confidence then gets a mischievous grin on her face.

<<say $companionLily>>Do you think that we never hear about people coming this deep because their balloons don't reach the surface, and nobody who comes this deep is able to return alive?<</say>>
Despite her joking tone, you get a slight chill down your spine. This unnerving place has been giving you that impression the whole time you've been on this layer, but Lily laughs.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh relax. We'll get out of here, and then they're going to tell stories about us for ages. The team that cracked the 8th seal, $mc.name and Lily, the paladins of doom and their journey beyond time and space. Okay, maybe that's a bit overly dramatic, but we're making history here. Keep your chin up, and stay stylish, we've got this.<</say>>
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 8

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, these doll things that keep following us are easy to take down, but their movements are weird. I wonder how many of them there are in this place, and what they even are. Where do they come from?<</say>>
He's looking a bit more confident than he did back on layer 7, but he's still clearly a bit on edge. He smiles. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's strange, I love exploring, adventure, combat, all this stuff. I'm the most experienced companion in the entire guild, but I feel a little torn about this place now that we're so deep. Since we came down into this labyrinth of stairways and empty rooms, I've had this prickle on the back of my neck. There's something about this place that's very dangerous, and I love it, I love the creepy adventure of it all, but at the same time, I'm not quite sure I can handle it.<</say>>
Khemia peeks his head around a hallway corner, checking for danger.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's like this violin is holding one high note the whole time we're down here, and I can't decide if I'm in love with this layer, or if I hate it. Every time we turn a corner I'm expecting something horrific to happen. Am I going crazy?<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 8

<<say $companionCherry>>Games... do you ever wonder why we play their games?<</say>>
You look at Cherry quizzically, and she stares back blankly.

<<say $companionCherry>>I mean it's obvious, right? Everything here is a puppet. Nothing here is entirely real, it's all a game.<</say>>
You still don't understand what she means. She sighs.

<<say $companionCherry>>I just can't help but wonder if we're not puppets too. Is there something out there, pulling on our strings, forcing us to do these things? Nothing down here makes sense, except that.<</say>>
Then she is silent, and just trails along after you as you proceed along yet another uncanny corridor.
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 8

Cloud appears somewhat distressed.

<<say $companionCloud>>This place... it should not be.<</say>>
He looks at you intensely.

<<say $companionCloud>>Can't you feel it? There's something very wrong here. These endless stairs to nowhere, these passages, the weird dolls, the food, the water, everything is just... wrong.<</say>>
Part of you isn't sure what he's talking about, because everything in the Abyss has felt kind of wrong to you, though not always in a bad way. Another part of you resonates strongly with what he said though. There is something deeply unnerving about this layer that's different from the ones before it.
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 8

<<say $companionSaeko>>Okay, I'm trying not to freak out, but this place is unnerving. Physics isn't working properly here. That in and of itself should be very alarming. The "food" and "water" both seem to have neuro-degenerative effects, which personally terrifies me. And when I look at surfaces through my microscope, do you know what I see?<</say>>
You shake your head, unaware of her observations.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Nothing! No fungal spores, no bacteria, no tiny insects, nothing. I can do my best to keep us protected, but even my best efforts aren't really enough. This place should not exist. We probably shouldn't be here. These animated doll-like things just aren't right. I saw one of them earlier that looked just like you, but it was wrong and I knew it wasn't anything like you. I'm afraid here, and you should be too.<</say>>
<br>

:: Maru Layer 9

The cold dark water seems to give Maru the shivers as he navigates through. Communication under the water poses a challenge, but you can discern his words.

<<say $companionMaru>>I want to believe you have our best intentions at heart, but this place... it scares me. Can't we find another way? I feel eyes on us everywhere down here.<</say>>
Maru's eyes are filled with a silent plea, but you're unable to fully comfort him in the bleak darkness of the depths.

:: Lily Layer 9

Lily effortlessly swims beside you, casting a skeptical glance your way. Hidden emotions seem to twinkle behind her eyes.

<<say $companionLily>>You know, I enjoy a good swim, but this? Isn't this a bit much?<</say>>
You offer no response, only continuing your underwater journey.

<<say $companionLily>>Sure, I could grumble about those moving shadows over there, or our dwindling supplies. Or about barely being able to see a thing. But hey, I chose this life, and I'm all in. That said, it'd be wrong of me not to point out that we're definitely out of our depth. And I'm not just talking about the water.<</say>>

:: Khemia Layer 9

<<say $companionKhemia>>This Elder... defeating it might be impossible.<</say>>
Khemia seems troubled, his gaze distant, likely processing potential strategies.

<<say $companionKhemia>>We may not stand a chance against it, but with the right strategy and tools, we could survive an encounter or two. When it decides to face us next, I'll be ready. Make sure you are too.<</say>>
Determination fuels him as he continues swimming forward.

:: Cherry Layer 9

Cherry's pace is slow but consistent through this murky domain. Her eyes seem weary, yet devoid of fear. As she meets your gaze, you look away first. You hear her whisper to you.

<<say $companionCherry>>In a strange way, this place feels right. It's a place of endings.<</say>>
Returning her gaze, she's still staring intently.

A coldness in her eyes chills you deeper than the surrounding water. Cherry says no more, but in that silence, doubt snakes its way into your heart.

:: Cloud Layer 9

Cloud's demeanor has been noticeably off since entering this layer. Every glimpse you catch of him reveals a tortured expression. Now, you catch him gazing at the obscure shadows far off.

<<say $companionCloud>>All this power, and this is the truth it reveals?<</say>>
You observe him closely. He exhales slowly, eyes shut.

<<say $companionCloud>>I did not wish it to be true... but, I understand.<</say>>
When he looks up, there's a newfound steely resolve in his eyes. The journey continues, but the sense of unease grows.

:: Saeko Layer 9

Saeko reaches out, grabbing your arm as she propels herself next to you.

<<say $companionSaeko>>We can't stay here.<</say>>
She appears incredibly on edge.

<<say $companionSaeko>>The Elder... it won't just kill us. Staying here, we risk something far worse.<</say>>
Catching her earnest expression, you recall the many dangers you both have faced. She simply shakes her head.

<<say $companionSaeko>>No, you don't get it. All my knowledge feels useless now, as if reality itself is lost in these depths. But one thing's clear: the Elder shouldn't exist, yet it does. And it will erase everything we are. We need to leave.<</say>>

<<say $companionLily>>Come here sweety, it's time to drink up again.<</say>>
Without protesting you go to Lily. She sits down and bares her breast, exposing her enticing nipple for you. You lay your head in her lap and take her nipple in your mouth, then begin to gently suck.

<<say $companionLily>>Drink as much as you can, so can become big and strong.<</say>>
Lily whispers softly to you, in a way that makes it seems she's really getting into this fantasy. You suckle her sweat breast milk while she runs he hand through your hair lovingly.

<<say $companionLily>>Well, maybe don't become <i>too</i> big and strong.<</say>>
She giggles as you continue to drink your fill, her nourishing milk flowing freely through your lips.

Cherry is hovering around you again, as if she is anticipating something. The fact she is actually approaching you likely means something, and you suspect you know what it is.

	You smile gently and nod to her, giving a signal to get closer to you.

You pull out a dish and fill it with your breast milk, then present it to her.

	You whistle to get her attention and she slowly approaches.
<</if>>\
Cherry seems happy to come over to you, or at least it seems a little less like a chore than everything else she does. She brushes up against you as she approaches the plate. You pet her head and run your hands through her hair while she laps it up.

:: CloudConvoLac Rep
<<say $companionCloud>>You're leaking again.<</say>>
Cloud speaks matter-of-factly, a simple statement of fact. But he follows through on those implications as he approaches you. You look down to check your clothes, but Cloud is already helping you out of them. He bends you over while he sits on his knees beside you.

<<say $companionCloud>>Just relax, I know you enjoy these sessions. Sometimes, it's good to relax and let things flow. Let me take control here.<</say>>
You can hardly argue with him as he begins to massage your breasts. The gentle sensation spreads a wave of relief through your body as it clears you of your stockpile of milk. You feel the pressure in your chest alleviated as his massage squeezes the liquid from your breasts.

You're taken aback and puzzled by Maru's question.

<<say $mc>>What are you talking about?<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>>The cloth diaper! Is it absorbent enough? Have you had any leaks?<</say>>
Heat surges to your cheeks as Maru probes further.

<<say $mc>>Yes, it works just fine. Thanks.<</say>><br>

As you stroll by Lily, she affectionately pats your cushioned rear.

It's evident that he's lost some respect for you since you started wearing a diaper.<br>

A sudden, desperate need to pee washes over you. Frantically, you paw at the diaper hidden beneath your dress, but there's no way to remove it.

<<say $creepydoll>>...<</say>>
<<say $mc>>I know you can hear me. Do something!<</say>>

Reluctantly, you rise and search for a place to relieve yourself. To your surprise, you do need to go. Perhaps this schedule is more necessary than you initially thought.<br>

<<say $companionSaeko>>Alright, $mc.name, it's time for bed.<</say>>
You let out a heavy, exasperated sigh.

<<say $mc>>I was actually planning on doing some more things. Why do I have to go to bed so early?<</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>The schedule dictates your bedtime, and there's no room for negotiation.<</say>>
With another deep sigh, you concede and start preparing for bed.<br>

Exhausted from the long walk you had today, you eagerly reach for a sip of water. Just as you're about to take a gulp, Saeko snatches the bottle from your grasp, nearly causing you to choke.

:: Maru Freckle Speckle

As you wander through the otherworldly splendor of the first layer, Maru approaches you with a wide smile on his face.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh, look at you!<</say>>
Maru's voice is a melody, light and joyous, as he bounds over to where you sit on a mossy log. His big blue eyes are wide with wonder as he examines your new appearance.

You feel his small fingers gently tracing the freckles and moles that now adorn your skin. They are warm, a comforting touch amidst the alien grandeur of the Abyss. He giggles softly, poking at one of the speckles on your arm.

<<say $mc>>Do you like them?<</say>>
You ask, raising an eyebrow as you watch him examine your skin.

Maru responds with an enthusiastic nod, his tousled hair bobbing with the motion. His eyes sparkle with a mixture of curiosity and delight.

<<say $companionMaru>>They're so cute! Like little stars scattered across the sky, but on you!<</say>>
He gushes, his words tumbling out like a bubbling brook.

He then gently brushes his fingers over the under-eye beauty mark, his face full of innocent fascination. His touch is gentle, his fingers barely grazing your skin, yet the sensation sends a warm shiver down your spine.

<<say $companionMaru>>And this one...<</say>>
Maru coos, touching the beauty mark under your eye.

<<say $companionMaru>>Is my favorite. It's like a little teardrop, but it doesn't make me feel sad. It makes you look even more interesting!<</say>>
Feeling a blush creeping onto your cheeks, you laugh, shaking your head slightly.

<<say $mc>>Well, I'm glad you approve, Maru.<</say>>
He giggles again, the sound like wind chimes in the early morning breeze, before bounding away to explore more of the strange new world around him. You're left with a gentle smile on your lips and a warmth in your heart.

:: Maru Knife-ear

The delicate light filtering through the thick foliage of the Abyss' first layer paints an ethereal backdrop as you find yourself rousing from a night of fitful slumber. The crunch of leaves underfoot and the rustle of fabric announce Maru's approach before he bounces into view, his hair tousled and his eyes sparkling with the excitement of a new day.

<<say $companionMaru>>Good morning, sleepyhead! Oh, you look different... and cute! I like it!<</say>>
His words are a cheery chirp, his gaze tracing over the changed form of your ears with unabashed curiosity.

<<say $mc>>Do I? I guess I do feel a little different.<</say>>
You reach up, fingertips brushing over the new contours of your ears, their sharp, pointy tips a triggering a strange sensation that sends a shiver down your spine.

Maru tilts his head to the side, curiosity gleaming in his eyes as he reaches out with a hesitant hand, his fingers hovering just shy of your ears.

<<say $companionMaru>>Can I... can I touch 'em? They're so... so... elfy!<</say>>
His words tumble out in a rush, a flush spreading across his cheeks, accentuating the adorable shape of his nose.

<<say $mc>>Sure, just be gentle.<</say>>
As his fingers delicately trace the curves of your ears, a soft gasp escapes him, his eyes widening. You also gasp at the unfamiliar sensuality of your new ears.

<<say $companionMaru>>They're so soft... and really warm! You're like a real elf now!<</say>>
His excitement is palpable, and it's infectious. Despite the strangeness of your transformation, you can't help but share in Maru's joy, his enthusiasm reminding you of the wonder inherent in the ever-changing world of the Abyss.

:: Maru Hair Removal

As you wander through the first layer, a chorus of alien bird songs flutter through the air, creating an otherworldly song.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh! Look at you, all shiny and smooth! Your skin is like a baby's!<</say>>
Maru's eyes sparkle with amusement as he observes you, his words filled with childlike wonder. His hands, small and soft, reach out to touch your bare arms. He hesitates for a moment before reaching forward and gently caressing your skin. He giggles softly, the sound echoing off the surrounding vegetation.

<<say $mc>>It's a little strange, isn't it? I'm not used to being so... hairless.<</say>>
You glance at your arms, at the skin that now shines almost pearlescent in the strange miasmal light. The sensation of Maru's touch is more apparent without the barrier of hair, making you hyper-aware of the cool air brushing against your skin.

<<say $companionMaru>>But you look so clean! Like a polished stone or a shelled egg! I think it's really nice.<</say>>
Maru's words come out in excited bursts, his wide-eyed fascination with your transformation infectious. His head tilts to one side, his own shaggy hair falling across his eyes, forming a stark contrast to your own now immaculate brows. His cheeks flush with a hint of pink as he continues to study your new appearance, clearly intrigued by the change.

<<say $mc>>Well, if you think it's nice, then I suppose it can't be all that bad. It's just going to take some getting used to.<</say>>
You manage a small smile, your fingers absently tracing the smooth skin of your arm. Despite the strangeness of the change, Maru's endearing enthusiasm brings a sense of lightness to the situation.

:: Maru Maximum Fluff

You sit, back against the rough bark of a massive tree, your new fur-covered skin prickling against the coarse texture. A myriad of chirps, calls and rustles fill the air, painting a lively portrait of the rainforest around you.

<<say $companionMaru>>You look... different, you know? Like a cute, fuzzy...um, creature!<</say>>
Maru's wide eyes, reflecting the sunlight in a soft shine, look at you with a mixture of awe and curiosity. His small fingers reach out to touch your fur, hesitating slightly in the air.

You nod, giving him a reassuring smile. The $mc.skinType fur on your body, soft and surprisingly warm, has become a part of your new existence in the Abyss.

<<say $mc>>Feels strange, doesn't it?<</say>>
You extend your arm towards him, inviting him to touch.

Maru's face brightens as he reaches out and carefully brushes his fingers through your fur. His touch is light and tentative, like that of a child petting a kitten for the first time.

<<say $companionMaru>>It's super fluffy! Like, really, really fluffy. It's like touching a cloud... but it's you!<</say>>
He giggles, a sound much brighter and more cheerful than the dim miasmal light that penetrates the dense foliage surrounding you.

You chuckle softly, ruffling the fur on your arm. It's an odd sensation - to be covered in fur, to feel each strand move as if it's part of you. It's even stranger to see Maru's reaction - his innocent delight, his pure fascination with your transformation.

<<say $mc>>I never thought I'd turn into a living plush toy in the Abyss.<</say>>
You say with a laugh.

Maru's laughter joins yours, echoing in the lush greenery of the Abyss. The sound is a bright note against the gentle patter of the rain around you.

<<say $companionMaru>>But you're the cutest plush toy, right? Like a... a special Abyss edition!<</say>>
His giggle punctuates the sentence, and you can't help but join in his infectious laughter.

:: Maru Comic Relief

The caverns of the third layer of the Abyss radiate an eerie, ethereal glow, casting long, shivering shadows on the walls. Strange, almost bioluminescent plants bask in the dim light, their colors a muted array of purples and blues. A soft, echoing drip-drip-drip of water resonates throughout the vast expanse, the only sign of life in this otherwise desolate space.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh my! Look at you!<</say>>
Maru's voice is bright and cheerful, bouncing off the cave walls, a stark contrast to the somber quiet. He's a small figure in the vastness of the cavern, his youthful face glowing with an innocent curiosity. His big, round eyes are wide open, a glimmer of amusement dancing in them as he stares directly at you.

<<say $mc>>What? Is there something on my face?<</say>>
You reach up to touch your face, your movements seeming exaggerated, comically clumsy, to any observer. The stones under your feet seem to wobble, or maybe it's just your newfound apparent awkwardness.

<<say $companionMaru>>No, no! It's not that, silly! It's just... you're so... so... funny!<</say>>
He tries to stifle a giggle, a hand over his mouth, but the sound escapes anyway, bouncing off the walls of the cave. His other hand points at you, wiggling in an attempt to contain his mirth.

<<say $mc>>Funny? I'm not trying to be funny.<</say>>
You try to maintain your dignity, but your voice seems to rise in a squeaky protest. A sudden gust of wind from deeper within the Abyss catches your cloak, making it flutter dramatically around you, making it seem as if you nearly lose your balance on the rocks you stand on, narrowly avoiding a fall.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh no, no! Not 'funny' like that! It's just... you're so different! Like a big, silly, clownfish!<</say>>
He giggles again, his voice resonating in the cavern, making the soft glow from the nearby fungi flicker in response. His eyes are alight with mirth, the corners crinkling as he laughs, and you can't help but be drawn into his infectious joy.

But somehow it still feels strange, that this is how everyone will always see you from now on.

:: Maru Crossdress Your Heart Male

Shimmering crystals of frost cling to the edges of your new attire as you trudge through the snowy wilderness of the Abyss's fourth layer. The biting chill wraps around your legs, made bare by the knee-length skirt you now wear. You're surprised to find the boots, despite their high heels, to be quite practical for navigating the deep snow. You glance down at your new attire, a mixture of consternation and acceptance flickering across your face.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh, oh! Look at you, all pretty and stuff!<</say>>
Maru exclaims, his eyes sparkling with delight as they rake over your appearance. His voice, high-pitched and filled with an infectious cheer, cuts through the icy air. The fluffy scarf around his neck flutters as he jumps in excitement, a striking contrast to the frigid landscape surrounding you.

His cheeks, rosy from the cold, brighten even more as he giggles, wrapping his mittened hands around his mouth. His long eyelashes flicker like butterfly wings, drawing attention to his shining eyes, which are almost the same color as the snowflakes falling around you.

<<say $mc>>Well, I guess this is a new look for me.<</say>>
Looking down at yourself, your voice is filled with both amusement and resignation.

<<say $mc>>Do you think it suits me?<</say>>
Maru's tiny gasp echoes in the silence before his face breaks into a smile, one that seems to warm up the frosty air around you.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh, absolutely!<</say>>
He claps his hands together in a display of obvious joy.

<<say $companionMaru>>It's like...like you've always belonged in these clothes. And the color! It brings out your eyes perfectly! You're absolutely, positively adorable!<</say>>
He spins around in the snow, his own dress flaring out around him, his laughter filling the the otherwise quiet, snow-covered expanse of the Abyss's fourth layer. The sparkle in his eyes as he looks at you again is unmistakable. His cute and charming demeanor, juxtaposed against the harsh environment, provides at least a little bit of comfort in this harsh environment.

:: Maru Crossdress Your Heart Female

The icy winds of the Abyss's fourth layer nip at your exposed face as you adjust the collar of your new attire. The rough texture of the male adventurer's clothes is a stark contrast to the silken dresses you're accustomed to. You feel the solid weight of the sturdy leather boots, providing a firm grip on the snowy landscape, and the warmth of the thick trousers against the cold. You glance down, observing the change in your attire with a furrowed brow.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh my, look at you!<</say>>
Maru exclaims, his voice a lively lilt in the otherwise harsh and silent landscape. His eyes are wide with surprise and curiosity as he takes in your new appearance. His lips part in a small 'o' of amazement, the fluffy scarf around his neck bobbing in time with his words.

<<say $companionMaru>>You look... different, but it's a good kind of different!<</say>>
He claps his mittened hands together, the sound muffled but distinct in the wintry air. His eyes, as clear and bright as the frosty landscape around you, sparkle with intrigue and excitement.

<<say $mc>>I suppose I do look a little different.<</say>>
A hint of amusement tinging your tone as you run your fingers over the rough fabric of your shirt.

<<say $mc>>Do you think it suits me?<</say>>
Maru's giggle echoes around you, the sound carrying a warmth that seems to temper the bitter cold.

<<say $companionMaru>>It really does!<</say>>
He insists, his cheeks reddening further from more than just the chill.

<<say $companionMaru>>You look so cool, so strong! It's like you're ready to take on the whole Abyss by yourself!<</say>>
He twirls around, his own dress fanning out around him, and the sight brings a smile to your face. His laughter, light and clear, rings out through the icy expanse, a beacon of joy and positivity in the desolate landscape.

:: Maru Flower Power

The sweltering heat of the desert in the fifth layer of the Abyss pressed down on you, causing the flowers and vines woven through your body to release a gentle, sweet aroma that mixes with the dry air. The petals replacing your hair fluttered slightly in the occasional breeze, a vibrant contrast against the monotonous sandy dunes around you.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh my, look at you, all floral and blooming! You're just like a desert flower, right? All pretty and resilient.<</say>>
Maru's eyes sparkled with innocent fascination, his own delicate features accentuated by his cute feminine attire. He reached out a soft hand, tracing the path of a creeping vine on your arm with a touch as light as a butterfly landing on the petal of a flower.

<<say $mc>>It's a bit of a shock, isn't it? Not exactly what I expected when we started this journey.<</say>>
You tried to keep your tone light, but the truth of your transformation was still a bit unsettling.

<<say $companionMaru>>Shock? Oh no, not at all! You're more... um, unique now! And I think you're still very you, just with a bit of... um, flower power!<</say>>
Maru giggled at his own words. His gaze was full of genuine admiration. He seemed to see past the oddity of your transformation, to the person you remained underneath the floral facade.

<<say $mc>>Well, I'm glad you think so, Maru. It's good to know at least one of us isn't completely freaked out by this.<</say>>
Maru's laugh echoed around you, a comforting sound against the otherwise barren surroundings.

Maru sits beside you, his blue hair shimmering in the soft miasmal glow. His eyes keep darting to your newly formed tail, a mix of concern and fascination evident in his gaze.

<<say $companionMaru>>Um... how are you feeling? With the... you know...<</say>>
He gestures vaguely at your tail as he speaks. You shift uncomfortably, your scaled tail flopping awkwardly on the ground.

<<say $mc>>I'm still trying to wrap my head around it, to be honest.<</say>>
Maru nods sympathetically, fidgeting with the hem of his dress.

<<say $companionMaru>>I can't even imagine what it must be like. Does it... hurt?<</say>>
You flex your new appendage, feeling the strange sensations course through you.

<<say $mc>>Not really. It's more disorienting than painful. Everything feels a little off-balance, compared to before.<</say>>
Maru leans in, his curiosity seemingly overcoming his shyness.

<<say $companionMaru>>It's kind of beautiful, in a way. Like a living work of art. But... oh! I'm sorry, that probably doesn't help much, does it?<</say>>
You can't help but smile at Maru's flustered expression.

<<say $mc>>It's okay. I appreciate your honesty. At least someone's finding some beauty in this situation.<</say>>
Maru's face softens, a determined look replacing his earlier uncertainty.

<<say $companionMaru>>We'll figure this out together, okay? I may not be the bravest diver, but I promise I'll do whatever I can to help you adjust. Maybe... maybe we can practice swimming?<</say>>
The genuine offer of support warms your heart, despite the chill of the cavern.

<<say $mc>>Thanks, Maru. That means a lot. Though I'm not sure how useful this tail will be down here in the Abyss...<</say>>
Maru taps his chin thoughtfully, his eyes lighting up with an idea.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh! What if we encounter underwater passages? Your new tail might give us an advantage in exploring places we couldn't before. Every Curse has a silver lining, right? Or, uh, most of them at least!<</say>>
His optimism is infectious, and you find yourself considering the possibilities.

<<say $mc>>You might be onto something there. I guess we'll have to see what the Abyss throws at us next.<</say>>
Maru beams, clearly pleased to have lifted your spirits. He stands up, smoothing out his dress.

<<say $companionMaru>>That's the spirit! And remember, no matter what form you're in, you're still you. Tail, legs, or whatever comes next – we're in this together.<</say>>
As Maru offers you a hand to help you up, you realize that despite the challenges ahead, having a friend like him by your side makes the journey a little less daunting.

:: Saeko Flower Power

The heat of the fifth layer of the Abyss is relentless, the harsh miasmal light beating down on the hard-packed desert sand. The wind kicks up sporadically, sending tiny shards of glass-like sand skittering across the expanse. You're standing there, your body transformed by the strange conditions of this place. What were once human features have morphed into something akin to a walking garden, flowers blooming across your skin and vines creeping along your limbs. Your hair, now a vibrant array of leaves and petals, rustles with each gust of wind, releasing a sweet, almost intoxicating scent into the dry air.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Fascinating... I've never seen a transformation quite like this. How do you feel?<</say>>
Saeko, your academic companion, squints at you from behind her rectangular glasses. Her eyes, sharp and analytical, flit over your altered form, taking in every detail. A small notebook is clutched in her hand, her pen rapidly scratching across the pages.

<<say $mc>>It feels... strange. Not bad, just... different.<</say>>
You're surprised to find your voice is the same, not changed to some sort of floral trill. You run your fingers over the petals sprouting from your skin, their soft, velvety texture unfamiliar yet oddly comforting.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Hmm, from a biological perspective, this is truly remarkable. I wonder... does the pollination process occur?<</say>>
Saeko's scientific curiosity is fully awakened. You can see her mind working behind her glasses, pondering over possible explanations and theories. Her fingers twitch, as if longing to pluck a sample from you.

<<say $mc>>Do you really think I could be pollinated by a plant?<</say>>
The thought of, well, breeding with a plant seemed strange to you, yet somehow within the realm of possibility.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I suspect not, as we haven't seen any fruits or seeds from you yet. But it's hard to say without testing it. Do you want to try?<</say>>
Her words, though seeming to be cold, hold a subtle undercurrent of concern. Despite her scientific excitement, Saeko's gaze softens slightly when she looks at you. And when you shake your head in response to her question, she nods and doesn't press the issue.

:: Saeko Carapacian

The surface of your new exoskeleton glistens under the harsh sunlight and you can feel the surprisingly cool sensation of your new carapace over your body, a strangely comforting sensation amidst the dry, scorching landscape.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Fascinating...<</say>>
Saeko mutters under her breath, her gaze locked onto you. She's been observing you like this for the past few minutes, her academic curiosity piqued.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Your exoskeleton's structure is extraordinary.<</say>>
You turn to look at her, a mixture of unease and curiosity in your eyes. The heat doesn't seem to bother Saeko as much, or if it does, she hides it well behind her thick-rimmed glasses and the scribbled notes in her hand.

<<say $mc>>It feels almost like armor, I guess.<</say>>
Saeko nods, her pen dancing across her notepad. Despite the situation, you can't help but appreciate her dedication to her studies.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Armor is an apt analogy. The exoskeleton of an insect is primarily for protection and support. Yours seems to function similarly. I'm curious though, how does it feel at the joints? There appears to be some elasticity there.<</say>>
You move your arm, feeling the natural give at the elbow. The sensation is not unlike wearing a well-fitted, lightweight glove.

<<say $mc>>It's flexible, like a second skin. And it's a bit cooler than the rest of me, which is... nice, considering the heat.<</say>>
Saeko smiles faintly, a look of pride and admiration hidden behind her scientific fascination. It's clear that she cares about you, even if she expresses it through her academic lens.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Remarkable... an adaptive thermoregulatory function as well. This change, while unexpected, is providing us with invaluable data. You're not just surviving the Abyss, you're evolving with it.<</say>>

Her breath forms a plume of fog in the freezing air as she studies you with keen eyes, a scientific curiosity lighting up her features despite the cold.

<<say $mc>>Not exactly the word I'd use, Saeko.<</say>>
Your voice sounds strange to your own ears now, somewhat muffled due to your elongated tongue which takes up more space in your mouth than it used to.

Saeko steps closer, her gloved hand reaching out tentatively towards your face.

<<say $companionSaeko>>May I?<</say>>
A question of consent, her respect for your personal boundaries outweighing her academic curiosity.

<<say $mc>>Go ahead.<</say>>
The words seem to twist around your unwieldy tongue.

Saeko's gloved fingers brush against your lower lip, a shockingly warm contrast against the cold of the Abyss. As you part your lips, she gazes at the transformed organ with wide-eyed fascination.

<<say $companionSaeko>>The musculature and length are beyond the scope of any human norm. Yet you seem to be adapting, able to speak despite the obvious hindrance. And every time you speak it seems to be less of an issue than before. It's... It's absolutely remarkable.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>It doesn't feel remarkable. It feels... weird. I'm struggling to avoid biting it.<</say>>
The corners of Saeko's mouth twitch upwards, a rare smile in this frozen landscape.

<<say $companionSaeko>>An understandable reaction. But the Abyss is a place of change. You should probably have expected things like this when you decided to come down here. Let's take this as an opportunity to study, understand, and adapt.<</say>>
Her hand falls away, and you find yourself missing the brief human contact in the frigid expanse of this layer.

<<say $mc>>Right, the scientist in her element.<</say>>
You can't help the touch of sarcasm in your voice.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Indeed. But remember, you're not alone in this. We're in this together, navigating the unknown.<</say>>
Her words, earnest and sincere, hang in the freezing air. And as you continue your conversation, your words become less clear as you adapt to the change that took place within your mouth.

:: Saeko Cold Blooded

As you wander through the frigid expanse of the fourth layer, Saeko moves closer to you, her eyes filled with curiosity. As she extends a gloved hand towards you, her breath hitches slightly. Her fingers make contact with your arm, and a flash of surprise crosses her face.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Your body heat... it's negligible. Far below what I would expect, even given the cold environment.<</say>>
Her tone is analytical and laced with curiosity, her scientific mind intrigued by the unexpected discovery.

<<say $mc>>I'm feeling colder, yes. I have to keep moving to stay warm. It's like the cold is inside me, not just around me.<</say>>
Your voice sounds strange to your own ears, the words coming out with more difficulty than you expected. The cold seems to be sapping your strength, your muscles aching with the effort of maintaining your body temperature.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Fascinating. Your body has adopted an ectothermic state, similar to some reptilian species. You're dependent on external heat sources now.<</say>>
Saeko's eyes light up, her scientific curiosity clearly piqued. She quickly pulls her hand back, her brow furrowing in thought.

<<say $mc>>Does that mean I'm a lizard now?<</say>>
Your attempt at levity falls flat, the cold seeming to sap not just your warmth but your sense of humor as well.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Not exactly. Your physiological responses have changed, certainly, but your genetic makeup remains the same. You're still a human... just a cold one.<</say>>
Saeko's words are clinical, detached, but you catch the faintest hint of concern in her voice. The snowfall around you provides an odd contrast to the warmth of her presence in this icy layer of the Abyss.

:: Saeko Gooey

The dim caverns of the third layer of the Abyss echo with the slow drip of water and the faint rustle of unseen creatures. The walls, slick with condensation, reflect the pale glow of luminescent fungi, casting an eerie, otherworldly light on your gooey form. Your sticky, slimy figure, once human, is now a shimmering $mc.skinColor, reflecting the surreal colors around you.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I must admit, your current physiological state is truly... fascinating. I've read about changes like this, but to see it in action is another matter entirely.<</say>>
Saeko's eyes, wide with curiosity and a hint of concern, study your form. Her gaze is clinical, inquisitive, as she stretches a hand to gently touch your arm. The contact sends a peculiar sensation rippling through your gelatinous form, neither pain nor pleasure, but something altogether foreign.

<<say $mc>>Does it bother you, Saeko? My... transformation?<</say>>
The faintest trace of a blush tints Saeko's cheeks, but she quickly regains her composure, shaking her head. Her fingers, though retracted, leave a faint, tingling trail on your arm.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Not at all. It is... different, yes, but it's a perfect example of the transformative properties of the Abyss. You've become something out of a theoretical paper, a living, breathing specimen.<</say>>
Saeko's voice echoes in the dim cavern, a soft counterpoint to the haunting silence. She brushes a stray lock of hair from her face, her expression one of focused fascination. Her fingers twitch, longing to note down observations, but her gaze never leaves you.

<<say $mc>>I'm glad you're taking it well. I was afraid you'd be... well, afraid.<</say>>
Saeko smiles then, her eyes softening as she looks at you. The academic veneer momentarily slips away, revealing the gentle concern lurking beneath her curiosity.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Your wellbeing is important to me. It's not just about the science, you know. But, I must admit, I can't help but find this... change... intriguing.<</say>>
Saeko's words hang in the air, echoing the sentiment in her eyes. Her scientific fascination with your transformation, though prominent, is tempered by genuine care and concern. She takes a step back, a silent promise to respect your space and boundaries, as you begin to continue your journey onwards.

:: Saeko 20/20000000

The dimly lit caverns of the third layer of the Abyss cast an eerie greenish hue, accentuated by the soft bioluminescent flora growing on the cavern walls. The occasional drip of water from the stalactites above punctuating the eerie silence of the caves.

<<say $companionSaeko>> Your eyesight... it's been noticeably worse since yesterday, hasn't it?<</say>>
Saeko's words hang in the air as she inspects you, her own red glasses reflecting the ambient glow. Her eyes, sharp and analytical, skim over you, the clinical gaze of a scientist dissecting a new phenomenon.

<<say $mc>>Yes, it's been quite... challenging. I can barely see past my own hand without these.<</say>>
You motion to the unstylish glasses perched on your nose, their thick lenses amplifying the cavern's light into your eyes. There's a slight discomfort, a small reminder of your newfound sensitivity.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Fascinating. The Abyss has a way of exaggerating our vulnerabilities, doesn't it?<</say>>
Her voice is calm, her scientific curiosity outpacing any underlying concern. She lifts her notebook, the worn leather cover illuminated by the bioluminescence around you. Her hand is steady as she jots down her observations, her red glasses slipping slightly down her nose.

<<say $mc>>I suppose it does. Though, I can't say I find it as fascinating as you do.<</say>>
Your voice carries a hint of amusement, watching as Saeko's eyes light up with the thrill of discovery. You adjust your glasses, the frames uncomfortably foreign against your skin.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Do the glasses help at all?<</say>>
She looks at you again, her gaze flickering with a strange mix of academic interest and something more personal, a hint of care buried under layers of scientific objectivity.

<<say $mc>>They do, somewhat. But it's... strange. I've never had to rely on them before.<</say>>
Saeko nods, chewing on her bottom lip in thought, her hands instinctively adjusting her own glasses.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Keep observing the changes, and let me know if anything else occurs. We must understand the effects better if we are to properly manage them.<</say>>
Her words are logical, practical, and yet, underneath it all, you can't help but sense a hint of worry, a crack in her scientific armor.

:: Saeko Increased Sensitivity
The first layer of the Abyss unfurls around you in an spectacle of slightly alien plant life. The air, thick with the scent of unknown flora, fills your lungs with an intoxicating sweetness. The shadows cast by the towering plants dance and sway. You can feel the tickle of the wind on your recently sensitized skin.

<<say $companionSaeko>>You've been acting differently since yesterday, you know. Unusual physiological responses, heightened skin reactivity, and your pupils are noticeably dilated... It's fascinating.<</say>>
Saeko's observant gaze scrutinizes you, her dark eyes reflecting the miasmal light of the Abyss. She removes a pair of gloves from her bag, her fingers meticulous and precise.

<<say $mc>>I can't deny it, Saeko. It's like every nerve ending is on high alert. Even the smallest touch...<</say>>
Your voice trails off, the sensation of your clothes brushing against your skin proving to be a continuous source of distraction.

Saeko nods, her analytical mind whirring with theories and hypotheses. She steps closer, her every move deliberate and calculated.

<<say $companionSaeko>>May I?<</say>>
Her voice is steady, but there's a hint of curiosity, an eagerness to understand that softens her normally stern demeanor.

<<say $mc>>Sure, just... be gentle.<</say>>
A small smile tugs at the corner of your lips, a mix of anticipation and anxiety coursing through you.

Saeko, with your consent, reaches out to brush a gloved hand across <<if $mc.breastsCor > 0 >>your breasts<<elseif $mc.penisCor > 0>>your bulge<<else>>your sensitive regions<</if>>. The sensation, although mild, sends a thrilling shiver down your spine, making your breath hitch. Saeko's eyes widen slightly, her brow furrowing in intrigue.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Remarkable... Your responses are akin to extreme tactile hyperesthesia, but you don't seem to be in pain. Quite the contrary.<</say>>
She withdraws her hand slowly, her gaze following the lingering trail of goosebumps on your skin.

<<say $mc>>It's... overwhelming, to be honest.<</say>>
Your words hang in the air, the mesmerizing beauty of the Abyss serving as a backdrop to the odd intimacy of this moment.

Her gaze meets yours again, the academic in her wrestling with the concern for a friend. Despite the mystifying allure of the Abyss, the unique transformation you're undergoing is equally, if not more, captivating to her.

:: Saeko Leaky

s you wander through the sixth layer, perpetual crimson haze hangs in the air, obscuring the distant twisted formations and bathing everything in a hellish glow. The faint scent of sulfur permeates the atmosphere, filling your nostrils with its pungent aroma.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I noticed some physiological changes in you, most interestingly your... increased fluid production. It appears the Abyss has affected you in quite a unique manner.<</say>>
Saeko's voice echoes in the eerie silence of the Abyss, her cool analytical demeanor in stark contrast with the infernal surroundings. She adjusts her glasses, her eyes scanning you with scientific curiosity.

<<say $mc>>It's... uncomfortable. But I suppose it could be worse. At least it doesn't hurt.<</say>>
Your voice cracks slightly, betraying your discomfort. You feel the trickle of fluid down your thighs, the perpetual slickness an unusual sensation that hasn't ceased since the transformation.

Saeko nods, scribbling something in her notepad. She's always been more comfortable with her research than interpersonal relations. Yet, there's a furrow in her brow and a slight crease in her normally composed expression.

<<say $companionSaeko>>It's indeed quite fascinating from a biological standpoint. The increased fluid production could potentially indicate heightened fertility, but it's hard to say without further examination. I wonder if...<</say>>
She hesitates, her gaze meeting yours for a moment before dropping to her notepad again. It's clear she's trying to navigate the strange intersection between her academic curiosity and her concern for you.

<<say $mc>>I appreciate the offer, Saeko. But for now, let's just focus on getting through the Abyss. I can deal with the... changes.<</say>>
Her gaze softens, the corners of her lips twitching upwards in a small, understanding smile. As the two of you continue your arduous journey, the acrid smell of the Abyss mingles with the distinct scent of your new, unusual fluids

:: Saeko Minish-ish

The cityscape around you hums with a quiet, artificial life. Neon lights flicker and shimmer in the polished chrome buildings, casting shades of cobalt and electric pink across the deserted streets. Your gaze can only just reach the bases of these towering monoliths from your new, downscaled perspective. The normally gentle thrum of electricity running through the city now sounds like the deafening roar of a waterfall to your sensitive, miniaturized ears.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Fascinating... The phenomena of the Abyss never cease to astonish me.<</say>>
Saeko murmurs, carefully adjusting her glasses. She's crouched down, her piercing gaze fixed on you. From your current height, she seems as colossal as the surrounding architecture.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I hope you're not feeling any discomfort. The sudden decrease in size must have been... quite a shock.<</say>>
You feel your feet lift off the cold metal surface beneath you as Saeko gingerly lifts you off the ground, places you in her palm, and raises you to eye level. The world sways beneath you with the slight, controlled tremor of her hand. Her face, framed by the neon glow of the city, displays a mixture of concern and curiosity.

<<say $mc>>It's a bit weird, to be honest, Saeko. Everything is so... loud. So big.<</say>>
Your voice sounds tinny and strange to your own ears. The city's hum, already loud, grows deafening as you speak, as if your words were competing with the city's synthetic heartbeat.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Indeed, your sensory perception must be radically different. I wonder how this change will impact our understanding of the Abyss... And of course, how it will affect our expedition.<</say>>
She frowns, her brow furrowing in deep thought.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Adaptation will be critical. I'll need to devise some method of transportation for you.<</say>>
With a soft smile, she places you gently into a pocket of her coat, providing a temporary refuge from the overbearing city sounds. The fabric mutes the harsh neon lights, casting a soothing, dim glow around you. Saeko's heartbeat, steady and rhythmic, provides a comforting backdrop to the city's clamor.

<<say $mc>>I appreciate your help, Saeko. It's... unsettling, this change. But I'm glad you're here with me.<</say>>
In the darkness of her pocket, the world doesn't seem so overwhelmingly large, and your journey through the Abyss, though changed, seems a little less daunting.

:: Saeko Colossal-able

As you wander through the seventh layer, your colossal form casts an even more massive shadow that stretches out in the city's lights, consuming entire blocks in its inky expanse.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Your transformation is quite... extraordinary, isn't it?<</say>>
Saeko gazes up at you, her wide eyes reflecting the neon glow of the city. Despite the awe-inspiring sight of your towering form, her voice maintains the calm, methodical tone of a dedicated scientist, as if she were observing an intriguing specimen in her laboratory.

<<say $mc>>It's been difficult to adjust, but I'm managing.<</say>>
Your voice rumbles down to her like distant thunder, your breath stirring up small gusts of wind that ruffle her hair.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Indeed. I can only imagine the challenges you face, both biomechanically and physiologically. The sheer increase in mass must be causing a significant increase in your energy requirements.<</say>>
She taps a finger against her chin, her gaze lost in thought as she studies you. Her analytical side is clearly captivated, viewing your situation through the lens of a researcher.

<<say $mc>>You're right. I've been feeling hungrier than usual.<</say>>
Your massive hand moves to rub at your stomach, the action causing nearby structures to tremble slightly with your movements.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I suspected as much. I'll start modifying our food supplies accordingly. But, it's not just the physical changes we have to consider. There are also psychological implications to such a drastic alteration.<</say>>
The corners of her lips pull into a tight line, her gaze softening slightly as she looks up at you. Her scientific curiosity is still present, but you can also see a hint of concern in her eyes.

<<say $mc>>What do you mean?<</say>>
Your brows furrow in confusion, the action causing a ripple to move through the skin on your forehead.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Changes of this magnitude can affect one's perception and cognition. This new perspective, the change in your body schema, it could potentially impact your spatial awareness and even your sense of self.<</say>>
Her voice is steady, but there's a note of unease underlying her words. It's clear that she is worried about more than just the physical implications of your transformation. 

<<say $mc>>You think it could affect my mind?<</say>>
A slight tremble enters your voice, betraying your apprehension. The towering buildings seem to sway sympathetically with you as you tower over them, a lonely giant in a city built for smaller beings.

<<say $companionSaeko>>It's a possibility we cannot ignore, yes. But remember, we're in this together. We'll observe, adapt, and overcome, just as we've always done.<</say>>
She squares her shoulders and looks up at you with a determined expression.

<<say $mc>>Thank you. That's comforting, Saeko.<</say>>
Despite your colossal size, her words manage to provide some solace. Your huge hand gently pats the ground beside her, an attempt at a reassuring gesture on a scale that the city has never witnessed before.

:: Saeko Seafolk

You find Saeko writing some notes in her journal when she spots you, her eyes widening behind her red glasses as she notices your new aquatic form.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Fascinating! Your physiological changes are quite remarkable. Would you mind if I conducted a brief examination?<</say>>
Before you can respond, Saeko is already circling you, her analytical gaze taking in every detail of your transformation.

<<say $mc>>I suppose a quick look couldn't hurt. Just... try not to poke me with anything sharp, okay?<</say>>
Saeko nods, barely containing her excitement as she flips to a blank page of her notebook and begins jotting things down.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Of course, of course. Now, let's see... The tail structure appears to be similar to that of certain deep-sea fish species. And those gills – absolutely intriguing! Have you noticed any changes in your respiratory system when submerged?<</say>>
You shift uncomfortably, still adjusting to your new form.

<<say $mc>>Well, I can breathe underwater now, if that's what you mean. It's... different, but not unpleasant.<</say>>
Saeko scribbles furiously in her notebook, her brow furrowed in concentration.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Remarkable! This Curse seems to have integrated aspects of multiple aquatic species. I wonder if it's drawing inspiration from the local ecosystem... Tell me, have you experienced any difficulties moving on land?<</say>>
You grimace, recalling your earlier attempts at locomotion.

<<say $mc>>It's been... challenging. I feel pretty graceful in water, but on land, I'm about as coordinated as a fish out of... well, you know.<</say>>
Saeko's expression softens slightly, a hint of concern breaking through her scientific enthusiasm.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I see. Well, if it's any consolation, many amphibious species face similar challenges. Have you experimented with different locomotion techniques? Perhaps a combination of undulating movements and using your arms for leverage?<</say>>
You nod, having already attempted various methods.

<<say $mc>>I've tried a few things. The seal-like dragging works okay, but it's not exactly comfortable. I'm still working on finding the right balance.<</say>>
She offers a thoughtful nod, her scientific mind clearly working on the problem.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Interesting. The unique structure of your tail might require a novel approach. Perhaps we could analyze the muscle structure and skeletal changes to develop a more efficient method of moving on land.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>I appreciate that, Saeko. For now, I guess I'll focus on not flopping around too much. Maybe you can teach me more about underwater movement?<</say>>
Saeko's eyes light up at the prospect of sharing her knowledge.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Absolutely! I have some theories about the biomechanics involved. Perhaps we could set up a small pool for practical experiments? Oh, and I'd love to take some scale samples, if you wouldn't mind. Purely for research purposes, of course.<</say>>
You can't help but chuckle at her enthusiasm, feeling a bit more optimistic about your situation despite everything.

:: Maru Horny

The air was thick with sulfur, yet it was not completely unpleasant, the scent strangely comforting as it seemed to emphasize the alien yet powerful aspect of your recent transformation.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh my gosh, just look at you!<</say>>
Maru's voice was a soft, excited squeal, his eyes wide and sparkling as they took in your new appearance. The young man, clad in a frilly dress, clutched his hands together, bouncing on his toes in his excitement.

The corners of your mouth twitched upwards in an amused smile, your fingers reaching up to trace the intricate patterns of the horn protruding from your forehead. It was a strange sensation, the horn warm and surprisingly sensitive to touch.

<<say $mc>>"It's quite the change, isn't it?"<</say>>
You tilt your head to allow Maru a better view.

Maru nodded vigorously, his twin tails of vibrant hair bobbing along with his movements. He moved closer, his curious gaze flitting between your eyes and the towering horn that adorned your head.

<<say $companionMaru>><<if $hornVariation === "draconic">>It's like... like you're a real-life dragon now! <<elseif $hornVariation === "demonic">> It's like... like you're a real-life demon now! <<elseif $hornVariation === "unicorn">>It's like... like you're a real-life unicorn now! <</if>>It's so, so amazing! It really suits you, you know?<</say>>
Maru gushed, his cheeks flushed with excitement, a stark contrast to the dim, ominous backdrop of the hellish tentacle-scape you're wandering through.

You let out a chuckle, patting the young man's head affectionately. His excitement was infectious, and you found yourself growing fond of your new appendage, as odd as it was.

<<say $mc>>Thank you, Maru. It's not every day you wake up with a $hornVariation horn, but I think I can get used to it.<</say>>
Maru's giggles echoed around you, a sweet melody against the low rumble of the sixth layer around you.

:: Cherry Shrunken Assets

The alien beauty of the first layer is a striking contrast to the bleakness in Cherry's dull eyes as she gazes at you. She sits on a mossy outcrop, her knees drawn up to her chest, and her chin resting on her folded arms.

<<say $companionCherry>>You look... different today, don't you?<</say>>
Her voice is barely above a whisper, as if she's afraid to disrupt the tranquil atmosphere around you.

You glance down at your newly transformed body, feeling a bit self-conscious due to the changes. The clothes that used to fit snugly now hang a little loose, emphasizing the transformation.

<<say $mc>>Different how?<</say>>
You try to sound nonchalant, but your voice betrays a hint of anxiety.

Cherry remains silent for a moment, her expression impassive, as if she's carefully selecting her next words. Her thin fingers idly trace an intricate pattern on the mossy ground.

<<say $companionCherry>>Less... substantial, I guess.<</say>>
She seems to hesitate in her response, as if trying to phrase it in a way that is least likely to upset you. You instinctively fold your arms over your chest, an attempt to hide the changes from her and from yourself. But it's a futile gesture. The sensation of emptiness is a constant reminder of the Curse you've obtained.

<<say $mc>>Do you think it makes me less... desirable?<</say>>
The words slip out before you can stop them, but there is an earnest curiosity underlying your question.

She raises her head, her gaze meeting yours. For a moment, her eyes flicker with something akin to surprise, before the familiar veil of apathy settles back in.

<<say $companionCherry>>That... would depend on who you're trying to appeal to, wouldn't it?<</say>>
Her voice holds an unusual note of softness.

<<say $companionCherry>>But you're still you, no matter how your appearance changes. Isn't that what matters most in the end?<</say>>
Her words, though spoken with the same flatness as always, carry a strange sense of comfort.

:: Cherry Double Pepperoni

After a long day of hiking through the caves, you sit, resting after the day's exhausting adventure, your shirt feeling peculiarly tight around your chest.

<<say $companionCherry>>You seem... different today. Is it... the Abyss doing its thing again?<</say>>
Her voice, typically monotonous, carries a hint of curiosity, pulling her from her usual state of resignation. Her weary eyes, once dull, now glimmer with a spark of interest as they cast a fleeting glance at your chest.

<<say $mc>>It appears so. Changes are inevitable down here, aren't they?<</say>>
Your words hang in the air, mingling with the damp chill of the cave. You feel a pang of sensitivity, your skin tingling under her gaze. Unconsciously, your arms fold across your chest, attempting to conceal the unusual swelling.

<<say $companionCherry>>They say... change is the only constant in the Abyss. It's kind of... ironic, isn't it?<</say>>
A hint of a smile tugs at the corners of her lips, a rare sight that adds a touch of warmth to her otherwise cold demeanor. Cherry, in her resigned acceptance of the Abyss's peculiarities, has found a strange semblance of humor in it.

<<say $mc>>I suppose it is. I guess we just have to roll with it.<</say>>
Your voice wavers slightly, but you manage to maintain a playful tone. For a moment, the sense of discomfort from your transformation fades, replaced with an odd feeling of camaraderie.

<<say $companionCherry>>Roll with it... yeah, I can do that.<</say>>
Her voice drifts off as her gaze flits back to the flickering glow of the bioluminescent fungi.

:: Cherry Megadontia

Your new teeth, unnaturally sharp and prominent, feel awkward in your mouth, especially the ones that extend beyond your lips.

<<say $companionCherry>>You look... different today.<</say>>
Cherry murmurs, her voice barely audible over the shrill wind. Her eyes, usually dull and void of emotion, flicker with a trace of curiosity as they focus on your mouth. She brushes a strand of frosty hair from her face, her gaze unwavering.

<<say $companionCherry>>Your smile... It's scary now, but oddly... interesting.<</say>>
Her words hang in the air, and the faintest ghost of a smile flickers across her lips. It's a rare show of emotion that fades as quickly as it comes. The snowfall seems to soften around her, the flakes drifting gently onto her red hair and pale shoulders.

<<say $mc>>Scary, huh? I suppose it's a bit much. But I'll get used to it, won't I?<</say>>
Your words are punctuated by a sharp click as your teeth come together, an unfamiliar sound that echoes in the empty expanse. Cherry flinches ever so slightly, her eyebrows knitting together in a mixture of concern and... intrigue.

<<say $companionCherry>>Yeah. Maybe you will.<</say>>
She replies, her voice so soft it almost merges with the whispering wind.

<<say $companionCherry>>After all, we all change down here. Constantly. Unavoidably.<</say>>
Her eyes return to the vast emptiness in front of her, yet there's an unfamiliar spark in them. It's the subtlest hint of anticipation, or perhaps fascination. A small, almost imperceptible change in her demeanor.

<<say $companionCherry>>Maybe it's not so bad... for things to be a little different.<</say>>
She pulls her threadbare coat tighter around herself, the howling wind seemingly unfazed by her quiet resilience. The icy landscape might seem utterly devoid of warmth or comfort, yet, in that moment, there's a strange sense of camaraderie between you and Cherry. A shared understanding. A journey, not just through the Abyss, but through the changes it has wrought within you.

:: Cherry DoS

The blazing miasmal light casts a harsh glare on the arid dunes of the Abyss's fifth layer. The hot sand underfoot feels like a furnace, and even the air tastes of dust and dry heat. Amidst this inhospitable landscape, you stand, transformed by the Curse you obtained the day before.

<<say $companionCherry>>You look... different.<</say>>
Cherry's voice is as flat and unenthusiastic as ever, her eyes just as dim. She doesn't seem shocked or scared by your transformation; rather, her gaze is resigned, as though she had expected this all along.

<<say $mc>>Different how, Cherry? I don't believe I've changed physically at all.<</say>>
Your voice, now deeper and somehow crueler, echoes in the vast expanse of the desert, startling a small flock of birds into flight in the distance.

<<say $companionCherry>>Your eyes... they're not the same. They're colder... harsher.<</say>>
Cherry reaches out with a slender hand, her fingers brushing against your cheek in a fleeting touch. The action seems to take a great deal of her energy, and she quickly retracts her hand, letting it fall limply by her side.

<<say $mc>>Does it scare you?<</say>>
Your question hangs in the air, a dark amusement hidden in your words. Cherry doesn't reply immediately, her eyes darting away from yours to stare blankly at the horizon.

<<say $companionCherry>>No... Nothing really scares me anymore.<</say>>
She shrugs, the action looking so small and defeated in the vast, scorched desert. Then, she gives a small, wistful smile, the first hint of emotion you've seen on her face.

<<say $companionCherry>>But I liked your old eyes better. They were... kinder.<</say>>
Her words, though spoken in her usual, lifeless tone, carry a weight of melancholy and nostalgia. You feel a pang of something – regret, perhaps, or guilt – but it is quickly overtaken by the sadistic pleasure that the Curse brings, numbing your capacity for empathy. You find yourself enjoying the pain and loss that Cherry feels for the older version of yourself.

<<say $mc>>I'm still the same person, Cherry. I'm still with you.<</say>>
Your words sound hollow even to your own ears, the irony of the situation not lost on you.

:: Cherry Wandering Hands

The heat of the Abyss prickled against your skin, a grim reminder of the relentless hostility of this place. The infernal hellscape of the sixth layer stretched out before you, its hellish glare bouncing off Cherry's pallid complexion, making her look even more ghostly.

<<say $companionCherry>>What are you doing?<</say>>
Cherry's voice echoed, sounding as if it was swimming through the dense, hot air. Her eyes, usually vacant and distant, now held a flicker of interest as she watched your hand wander to her chest.

You paused, blinking at your own hand as if it was an alien thing. A blush spread across your face as you realized what you were doing.

<<say $mc>>I... uh, I didn't realize. I apologize, Cherry.<</say>>
Your voice wavered, embarrassment mixing with the odd sensation of your body acting on its own.

The corners of Cherry's lips twitched upwards in the faintest hint of a smile. It was such a rare sight that it almost seemed more shocking than your own action.

<<say $companionCherry>>It's okay... It's not like you were hurting me or anything.<</say>>
Her voice was as flat as ever, but there was a strange softness to it that you hadn't heard before.

Your hand, as if it had a mind of its own, began to move again, fingers brushing over the soft fabric of Cherry's dress, tracing the curve of her breasts. The heat of the Abyss seemed to intensify, your pulse thrumming loudly in your ears.

<<say $mc>>I can't... I can't seem to stop it.<</say>>
You confessed, your voice barely a whisper.

Cherry's gaze dropped to your hand, watching it with a detached fascination. For a moment, the desolate look in her eyes seemed to waver.

<<say $companionCherry>>I guess... it's just something we have to deal with here... in the Abyss.<</say>>
She murmured, but she didn't pull away, she didn't even seem to mind as you continued your ministrations until you decided to get moving once again.

:: Cherry Weakling

The gloomy neon lights of the seventh layer of the Abyss flicker erratically, casting long, jittery shadows across the deserted streets of the robotic cyberpunk city and creating a melancholic backdrop to your exploration.

<<say $companionCherry>>You seem to be struggling with that, you know?<</say>>
Cherry's voice is a flat monotone, as if she's commenting on the weather rather than your predicament. She's observing you trying to lift your pack, an item that used to be an effortless part of your journey.

A sigh escapes your lips, filled with frustration. The once easy task of lifting your backpack has turned into a Herculean effort, your muscles straining against the once manageable weight.

<<say $mc>>It's nothing, Cherry... just, having an off day, I guess.<</say>>
Your voice cracks a little, betraying the irritation and embarrassment you feel.

Her green eyes, usually so dull and void of life, flicker with something you've not seen before. They widen slightly, just a hint of surprise and curiosity seeping through her depressive fog. The neon cityscape reflects in her irises, painting an eerie picture of shifting lights and shadows.

<<say $companionCherry>>Off day? You've been having trouble with that since yesterday. You're... changing, aren't you?<</say>>
Her voice trails off, the last word hanging in the air like a tangible thing. She doesn't sound concerned or alarmed, more intrigued and slightly... amused? It can be hard to tell with Cherry.

You exhale, setting the backpack down. The relief in your muscles is almost immediate, but it's short-lived as you turn to face her. You meet her gaze, the neon light casting an unnatural glow on your face.

<<say $mc>>Maybe I am, Cherry. This is the Abyss after all. People change here.<</say>>
You try to make light of the situation, your voice filled with a forced cheeriness.

She doesn't respond immediately. She just stands there, observing you. Then, a tiny quirk of her lips appears, so quick you almost miss it. It's a stark contrast to her usual flat affect, a small, cute crack in her armor of indifference.

<<say $companionCherry>>I suppose that's true... just don't forget to ask for help if you need it, alright?<</say>>
Her voice is still flat, her words laced with resignation, but the hint of concern is there, buried beneath the layers of fatigue and depression.

:: Cherry Seafolk

You're resting near a shallow pool of water you managed to find, your newly acquired tail splashing idly in the murky liquid. Cherry approaches, her eyes barely meeting yours as she slouches down next to you.

<<say $companionCherry>>So... you're part fish now. That's... something.<</say>>
Cherry's voice is as flat as ever, but there's a hint of curiosity in her gaze as she studies your transformed lower half.

<<say $mc>>Yeah, it's definitely an adjustment. Not exactly what I was expecting when I came to the Abyss.<</say>>
Cherry nods slowly, her fingers absently tracing patterns on the ground.

<<say $companionCherry>>Nothing ever goes as expected here. At least you can breathe underwater now. Might come in handy if we ever need to hide from... whatever's out there.<</say>>
You notice a slight shiver run through Cherry's body as she glances into the shadows beyond your small camp.

<<say $mc>>That's true. But moving around on land is going to be a challenge. I'm not exactly built for walking anymore.<</say>>
Cherry's eyes flicker with a rare spark of problem-solving.

<<say $companionCherry>>We could... I don't know, maybe fashion some kind of wheeled cart? Or a sled? It's not like the Abyss has smooth floors anyway. Never mind, it probably wouldn't help that much...<</say>>
You're surprised by her practical suggestion, and it brings a small smile to your face.

<<say $mc>>That's actually not a bad idea, Cherry. Thanks for thinking of that.<</say>>
She shrugs, her moment of engagement already fading.

<<say $companionCherry>>Don't thank me yet.<</say>>
There's a moment of silence as you both contemplate the challenges ahead.

<<say $companionCherry>>At least you're adapting. That's more than some can say down here.<</say>>
Her words carry a weight of personal experience, and you feel a twinge of sympathy for whatever Cherry has endured in this place.

<<say $mc>>We'll figure it out together, Cherry. Your ideas already show that we make a good team.<</say>>
Cherry doesn't respond verbally, but you notice her posture relax slightly. As she stands to leave, there's the faintest hint of a nod – an acknowledgment of your shared predicament and the small bond forming between you.

:: Cloud Perma-dye

The first layer of the Abyss is a marvel of serene twilight, an eerie yet captivating spectacle. Unearthly trees reach high towards the dim-lit sky, their leaves rustling in a whispering breeze, and the air is crisp with a touch of metallic chill. You and Cloud take a moment to rest, your recent transformation rendering you a bit disoriented.

Your $mc.hair colored hair adds an exotic aura to your presence. The change is somewhat unsettling, despite being relatively minor.

<<say $companionCloud>>Well, well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes? I always know you have a spark, but this... This is a full-blown flame.<</say>>
Cloud reclines against an imposing tree, his eyes gleaming with a mix of mischief and admiration. He crosses his arms, his ruggedly handsome face lit by an easy grin, reflecting the playful twinkle in his eyes.

<<say $mc>>It's certainly a change, isn't it? I'm still getting used to it.<</say>>
You brush your hand through your $mc.hair colored hair, feeling the strands slide through your fingers, the visual reminder of the Abyss's influence.

<<say $companionCloud>>Change, my dear, is the essence of life. And you... you become a glorious representation of that philosophy. You carry it with poise, like an artist's brushstroke on a canvas.<</say>>
Cloud's words resonate in the tranquil air, his voice rich with warmth. He moves to stand next to you, a picture of confidence against the backdrop of the Abyss, his eyes focused on the horizon but his thoughts, it seems, are much closer.

<<say $companionCloud>>It's a symbol, don't you see? A symbol of transformation, adaptation. It's beautiful. You're beautiful.<</say>>
He turns to look at you, a sincere glow in his eyes that mirrors the earnestness in his words. His charismatic presence weaves through the mystical environment, a portrait of a man dreaming yet firmly anchored in the reality of his vision. A new world, a better world, and you, at his side, evolving together with the Abyss.

:: Cloud Fluffy Tail

The canopy of the second layer stretches far above you, a dizzying array of greenery pierced by sharp shafts of sunlight. The air is thick with the smell of damp earth and the peculiar sweet aroma of unseen flowers. Your new tail, bushy and more akin to a $mc.curses.filter(c => c instanceof FluffyTail)[0].tailType's than any other creature's, twitches behind you. It's an unfamiliar feeling, the sensation of it brushing against your legs as you move, a constant fluffy presence.

<<say $companionCloud>>Well, if it isn't the cutest adventurer in all the Abyss.<</say>>
Cloud's voice echoes from behind you, his tone playful yet laced with a hint of admiration.

You turn to find him leaning against a colossal tree trunk, arms folded across his chest. His eyes, sparkling with a hint of mischief, rove over your altered appearance. His lips curl into a teasing grin, one that accentuates his devilishly handsome features.

<<say $mc>>Is this how you greet everyone you travel with, or am I special?<</say>>
Cloud chuckles, a sound as smooth and enticing as a river's flow, pushing himself off the tree. His boots crunch on fallen leaves as he approaches, the dappled sunlight from above casting intriguing shadows on his face.

<<say $companionCloud>>No, you're special, all right. You've got to admit, it's not every day you see someone sprout a fluffy tail. Especially one as charming as yours.<</say>>
A crimson blush blossoms on your cheeks, feeling the soft touch of his fingers brushing the fluffy tuft of your tail. A rush of unexpected sensation washes over you, making your heart beat a touch faster.

<<say $mc>>Charming, huh? Didn't know you're into tails, Cloud.<</say>>
Cloud laughs once more, his laughter echoing amidst the stillness of the forest. He lifts his gaze to meet yours, a knowing look in his eyes that only makes your heart flutter more.

<<say $companionCloud>>I'm into a lot of things.<</say>>
He winks at you as he speaks.

<<say $companionCloud>>But most of all, I'm into seeing people embrace change. And you, my dear, you manage to turn even a curse into an opportunity. That's more than charming, that's... enchanting.<</say>>
He offers you a soft, genuine smile, and for a moment, his playful facade falls away, revealing a glimpse of the heartfelt admiration beneath.

:: Cloud Submissiveness Rectification A

The air is cold and damp, filled with the echoing drips of water from stalactites in the third layer of the Abyss. Faint luminescent moss grows on the walls, casting an eerie glow that stretches across the shadowy expanse. You stand there, the eerie glow casting flickering shadows on you. But it's not your outward appearance that has changed the most - it's the shift in your demeanor, the newfound softness in your gaze, and the subtle yielding to Cloud's suggestions that marks the true transformation.

<<say $companionCloud>>Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes? I'm not sure what's happened, but you've got this alluring glow about you now. A charm that wasn't there yesterday.<</say>>
His voice, a harmonious blend of mischief and allure, echoes through the cavern. His eyes, lit up by the ethereal light, carry a glint of curiosity.

<<say $mc>>I... I feel different, Cloud. I'm not sure how to explain it, but I feel as though...I'm more inclined to listen to others, to go along with what they say.<</say>>
You admit, your voice echoing softly in the cold air of the Abyss.

Cloud chuckles, a warm, hearty sound that bounces off the stone walls, chasing away the eerie silence. He steps closer, his tall form silhouetted against the eerie green light of the cavern.

<<say $companionCloud>>Well, there's nothing wrong with a bit of... flexibility. It doesn't make you less. Remember, water can carve canyons over time. The strength of your spirit, the courage of your heart, they're all still there. If anything, you've become more versatile. More adaptable.<</say>>
His hand reaches out, gently brushing a stray lock of hair from your face. His touch is warm, contrasting the chilliness of the cavern around you. His fingers linger for a moment longer than necessary, and then he steps back, giving you space once again.

<<say $companionCloud>>You're still you, just a different shade. You're still the person I chose to venture into the Abyss with. And I believe in you, no matter what.<</say>>
His voice resonates with sincerity, reinforcing the bond you share as you explore the mysteries of the Abyss together, facing whatever changes and challenges it throws at you.

:: Cloud Lie Detector

Snowflakes dance in the air, glinting like tiny diamonds as they flutter in the half-light of the Abyss's fourth layer. The cold cuts through your clothing and leaves your breath hanging in the air like a spectral echo. You shiver, struggling to maintain a strong appearance despite your discomfort.

<<say $companionCloud>>You don't have to pretend it isn't freezing, you know.<</say>>
Cloud's words are almost lost in the icy wind, but his ever-present grin is as clear as ever against the white backdrop. His cobalt eyes study you, amused, from beneath the hood of his cloak.

<<say $mc>>I'm fine, really.<</say>>
A laugh slips from his lips, cutting through the quiet with a warmth that seems alien in the frigid wasteland.

<<say $companionCloud>>You're a terrible liar, you know that, right?<</say>>
He watches you curiously, seemingly unaffected by the cold. His words don't carry any harshness. Instead, they are lightly teasing, an extension of the playful charm that seems to be at the core of his being.

<<say $mc>>I... I just don't want to cause any trouble.<</say>>
There's a silence as Cloud's gaze softens, the mirth fading to reveal a flicker of understanding in his eyes.

<<say $companionCloud>>Hey, we're in this together. No need to sugarcoat things. If you're cold, you're cold.<</say>>
His words are simple, but they hold a sincerity that resonates in the icy quiet. His playful demeanor fades for a moment, replaced by a sense of seriousness that matches the severity of the landscape around you.

<<say $mc>>Thank you, Cloud.<</say>>
Cloud's grin returns, brighter than before, and he winks at you.

<<say $companionCloud>>Don't mention it. Now, how about we get moving? We're not going to find the heart of the Abyss by freezing to death, are we?<</say>>

:: Cloud DoM

The scorching heat of the fifth layer's desert lashes at your exposed skin. The sensation is akin to dancing barefoot on hot coals, but instead of agony, an odd sense of pleasure begins to unfurl within you, curling your lips into a twisted grin of delight.

<<say $companionCloud>>Interesting, I haven't seen that sort of smile on your face before.<</say>>
Cloud's voice, smooth as silk, cuts through the crackle of the searing air. His striking green eyes sparkle, mirroring the miasmal light's relentless glow.

<<say $companionCloud>>You're enjoying basking in this tormenting heat, aren't you?<</say>>
His gaze is fixed on you, as if he is studying an exotic creature in its natural habitat. Despite the unbearable heat, his characteristic confidence doesn't waver; instead, his charisma seems to intensify, undeniably alluring like a mirage in the merciless desert.

<<say $mc>>Can't help it, Cloud. This heat... it's not torment for me anymore. It's... blissful.<</say>>
You murmur to him, your voice strained with the pleasure-pain that prickles along your nerve endings.

A slow smile curls his lips, his interest piqued. Your transformation seems to fascinate him as much as it entranced you.

<<say $companionCloud>>You're starting to sound like a poet lost in her reverie. Didn't expect the unforgiving Abyss to bring out this side of you.<</say>>
He chuckles lightly, his eyes glinting with a roguish charm.

<<say $companionCloud>>It's strangely captivating. You're always full of surprises, aren't you?<</say>>
Despite the heat that turns your world into a scintillating blur, you are acutely aware of his presence as you continue your journey through the desert.

:: Cloud Submissiveness Rectification B

The crimson sky of the Abyss flickers as twisted and monstrous tendrils snake around the landscape, the ground throbbing with an ominous life of its own. The sanguine light casts an eerie glow onto the interior of your temporary camp. The shadows dance on the rippling walls of your tent, manifesting in bizarre, inky patterns.

<<say $companionCloud>>Well, well, look at you. You've got a new... spring in your step.<</say>>
Cloud observes you, his eyes twinkling with an inscrutable gleam. His voice is like warm silk, comforting yet undeniably provocative.

His observation doesn't escape you, the truth of it tingling just beneath your skin. You feel different; there's a softness about you that wasn't there before, an overwhelming urge to yield and obey. You sense Cloud's gaze lingering on your form, studying the changes in your demeanor and appearance.

<<say $mc>>Do I?<</say>>
Your voice feather-light and hesitant.

<<say $mc>>How... how so?<</say>>
Cloud grins, leaning back against the gnarled tentacle behind him. His lean frame cuts a dark silhouette against the luminous backdrop of the Abyss. The soft rustle of his clothing fills the quiet air as he gestures for you to come closer.

<<say $companionCloud>>You've always had fire, don't get me wrong. But there's a softer glow about you now. It's like a flower opening up... embracing the sun.<</say>>
Heat flushes your cheeks at his words, a sense of warmth blooming in your chest. His observations feel so intimate, like he's looking past your exterior and seeing something new and different within you.

<<say $mc>>Is... is that a bad thing?<</say>>
He takes a moment before answering, his gaze steady and deep as the Abyss itself.

<<say $companionCloud>>No, it's not a bad thing at all.<</say>>
He reassures you, then with a playful gleam in his eyes, he tilts his head and softly instructs.

<<say $companionCloud>>Come here.<</say>>
His voice is a whisper, echoing in the strange, breathing silence of your surroundings.

A subtle current, like a magnetic pull, compels you towards him. Your heart pounds in your chest as you respond to his command, an instinctual obedience that feels both foreign and familiar.

<<say $mc>>Okay.<</say>>
Your voice is barely above a whisper. You feel a soft thrill run down your spine as you rise to your feet, responding to his words with an uncharacteristic compliance.

Slowly, you cross the small distance between you and him, each step resonating with the hypnotic pulse of the sixth layer's tentacles. Your senses are attuned to Cloud's presence, and as you draw nearer, the earthy scent of his clothes mixes with the exotic odors of the Abyss, creating a heady blend that sends your heart fluttering.

<<say $companionCloud>>That's it... Easy now.<</say>>
He murmurs as you approach, his dark eyes softening with an unreadable emotion.

Once you're within arm's reach, he reaches out, and his hand gently brushes against your arm. The contact sends a wave of warmth coursing through you, intensifying the peculiar sensations brought on by your transformation. You can't help but lean into his touch, yearning for more.

<<say $companionCloud>>Look at you... Responding so willingly. It suits you.<</say>>
His words drip with a quiet authority that stirs something deep within you.

<<say $mc>>Does it?<</say>>
Your voice is small, filled with wonder and a strange acceptance.

Cloud's smile is soft, his eyes reflecting the eerie glow of the Abyss as he nods.

<<say $companionCloud>>Yes. It truly does.<</say>>
Cloud assures you, his voice a comforting rumble that grounds you amidst the alien strangeness of the Abyss.

:: Cloud Barter System

As you wander through the seventh layer, you notice Cloud giving you an odd look. His gaze lingers on you a moment longer before he moves to lean against a nearby wall, casting a quick glance around the desolate city.

<<say $companionCloud>>Let's talk about... how we're going to handle transactions when we get back up there.<</say>>
Cloud gestures vaguely upward, referencing the surface world you both had left behind.

He pauses, his gaze becoming more speculative as he studies you.

<<say $companionCloud>>You remember how we've always paid for things, right?<</say>>
His question hangs heavy in the air, despite the playful lilt to his tone.

<<say $mc>>Of course. What are you getting at, Cloud?<</say>>
Cloud chuckles, tipping his head back as a ripple of genuine laughter shakes his frame. When he recovers, his eyes are warm, his grin infectious.

<<say $companionCloud>>Well, when we get back to the surface, it seems like you'll have a whole new currency to work with.<</say>>
His smile fades a little, replaced by a thoughtful look.

<<say $companionCloud>>But be careful... it's a double-edged sword. And remember, every action has a reaction.<</say>>
The cryptic warning reverberates in the empty city, your mind whirling as you try to decode its meaning. You watch as Cloud moves away, his figure fading into the neon backdrop of the deserted cyberpunk city.

:: Lily Knife-ear

Your morning starts with an eerie glow filtering through the vast trees of the first layer of the Abyss, casting long shadows that add an uncanny allure to the surroundings. A light wind blows through the canopy above, making the leaves whisper hushed secrets to each other. Your sensitive elf ears catch every sound with an unusual clarity, their pointy tips twitching in response.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh my goodness! Just look at you! Those elf ears, they're like... wow! Just wow!<</say>>
Lily's wide eyes gleam with excitement, her voice lively and high-pitched. She eagerly steps closer, examining your pointed ears with a mix of curiosity and wonder. Her finger traces lightly over the shape of your ears, and you feel a jolt of sensitivity.

<<say $mc>>Hey! That's... kinda sensitive.<</say>>
You step back, cupping your ears instinctively. The sensation was overwhelming, but not entirely unpleasant.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh, sorry! I just got a little excited, you know. This place... it changes you in the most incredible ways! You now have these adorable elf ears, they make you look just like an anime character!<</say>>
She chuckles, her hands animated as she describes your new look, a playful glint lighting up her eyes. Lily's enthusiasm is infectious, and despite the strange situation you find yourself in, you find yourself laughing along with her.

<<say $mc>>Well, as long as I look like one of the good characters, I suppose I can handle that.<</say>>

:: Lily Blushing Virgin

In the embrace of the rainforest, you let your mind wander. A tame, yet tantalizing fantasy had taken shape, a daydream that painted Lily, your eccentric companion, in a new light.

It began simply, a friendly shared glance over the firelight, the playful sparks in her eyes reflecting the vibrant glow of the flames. A touch of shared warmth as you both reached for the last piece of a foraged meal - fingers brushing, a jolt of electric connection surprising you both.

The subtle fragrance of her hair, intensified by the humid rainforest air, filled your senses - a blend of rain-soaked ferns and something uniquely her. The sensation of her leaning into you, seeking warmth against the Abyss's chilly night, was surreal. A lingering touch, a lingering moment, and your pulse quickened as the line between friend and... something more, blurred.

Her bright purple eyes looked up at you, a world of shared secrets glimmering within. The light teasing in her voice softened to a husky whisper, sending delicious shivers down your spine. The feel of her fingers tracing small circles on the back of your hand, absentmindedly, or maybe not, sent a wave of anticipation coursing through you.

<<say $companionLily>>Well, well, aren't we lost in our thoughts? And with such a rosy glow too! Adorable!<</say>>
Lily's voice slices through your reverie like a sunbeam piercing the gloom, her laughter as vibrant as the lush foliage around you. Her bright purple eyes sparkle with amusement, the sight of your blushing face making her grin even wider. Her cotton candy colored hair - reflecting her bold personality - swings in harmony with her jubilant energy.

<<say $mc>>It's... It's nothing, Lily! Just... um... the heat, that's all!<</say>>
You stammer out the lame excuse, your face burning under her unabashed stare. You look anywhere but her, trying to create distance. However, the rainforest floor, a treacherous network of roots and vines, pushes you towards the grinning daredevil.

<<say $companionLily>>The heat, huh? Making you blush like a cherry? I'll remember that for the next time I want a good laugh!<</say>>
She saunters even closer, her probing gaze making you squirm. She maintains her relentless teasing, that infectious grin still playing on her lips. Pausing to adjust the straps of her backpack, she provides you with a moment of sweet relief from her pointed observations.

<<say $mc>>Can we... um... just move... forward?<</say>>
Your gaze darts to the inviting path ahead, the towering trees and vibrant undergrowth beckoning. It's a desperate attempt to divert the attention, a silent prayer embedded in your request.

<<say $companionLily>>Sure thing! But remember, no need to be all bashful about it. We're adventurers, change is our bread and butter! Now, let's see what other wonders the Abyss will reveal to us today!<</say>>
Her laughter echoes around the rainforest as she marches on, her unyielding enthusiasm matching the life teeming around you.

:: Lily Sleep Tight

The morning mismal light glimmers faintly against the frosted landscape of the Abyss's fourth layer. Nestled in the heart of this frigid landscape, you slumber peacefully, oblivious to the world, cocooned in layers of insulated fabric of your tent.

<<say $companionLily>>Oi! Sleeping Beauty! You've got to see this! The sunrise is phenomenal, like straight out of an anime!<</say>>
Lily's voice rings out, an energetic crescendo against the hush of the snowscape. Her rosy cheeks glow vibrantly against the icy blue backdrop, her wide, sparkling eyes shimmering with the thrill of a new day.

A dull sense of consciousness begins to rattle in your head. Stirring from your sleep, the warmth and comfort of your slumber begins to peel away, replaced by the biting cold of the Abyss's fourth layer.

<<say $mc>>Just... five more minutes, Lily...<</say>>
Your words come out in a low mumble, warmth and sleep still lacing your voice.

Her laughter rings out like a crystal bell, high and clear against the low murmur of the chilling wind. She kneels beside your sleeping bag, her hand gently shaking your shoulder.

<<say $companionLily>>Always with the sleep! Alright, you comfy-cozy adventurer, I'll give you five... but then you're getting up to see this, got it?<</say>>
Her words, although teasing, are laced with affection.

You let out a low, sleepy groan, pulling your sleeping bag tighter around you. The sheer comfort of sleep seems to be sinking into your very bones now, making it even more difficult to shake off the allure of the warm cocoon you've nested in.

<<say $mc>>Got it... five more minutes...<</say>>
Your words echo in the hushed cold, your breath forming icy crystals in the frigid air.

With a chuckle, Lily nudges you playfully, her fingers brushing against the rough material of your sleeping bag. The sound of her boisterous laughter echoing in the frosty air makes the icy wilderness a little less daunting, a little more like home. Her boundless energy and unquenchable thirst for thrill serve as an invigorating reminder of the grand adventure you have undertaken together.

<<say $companionLily>>Alright, sleepyhead! But remember, I'm setting a timer! Five minutes, and not a second more!<</say>>
Her voice is filled with infectious glee, her words laced with the excitement of the journey ahead.

:: Lily Massacre Manicure

The merciless heat of the Abyss' fifth layer blazes above you, transforming the vast expanse of sand into a glittering, molten sea. The heat makes mirages dance at the edges of your vision, but the way Lily's eyes spark with fascination is entirely real.

<<say $companionLily>>Hey, look at you, you're like a rock star! Those claws of yours are so edgy!<</say>>
Her gaze is drawn to your hands, to the claws that have replaced your fingernails. The sunlight plays off them, glinting dangerously.

<<say $mc>>A rock star, huh? I was thinking more along the lines of a horror movie monster.<</say>>
You flex your fingers, the claws extending slightly. Their sharp edges glisten ominously. Lily's energetic enthusiasm doesn't falter; instead, she grins, her love for the eccentric and unusual palpable in the scorching air.

<<say $companionLily>>Well, aren't you the life of the party! Embrace the uniqueness! Plus, think about the practical applications. Can opener? You've got it covered. Need to carve your name in a tree? Easy peasy. You're like an overgrown Swiss Army Knife now!<</say>>
Her giggles echo through the barren landscape, a lively melody against the monotonous hum of the distant sandstorms.

<<say $mc>>Yeah, well, it's not all fun and games. Have you ever tried scratching an itch with these things?<</say>>
You brandish your claws, your movements somewhat clumsy as you're still getting used to the new weight and size of your talons. Lily chuckles, a mischievous glint in her eyes.

<<say $companionLily>>Ooh, a challenge! Maybe I could find a way to fashion some cute claw covers for you. Oh, or we could paint them! Do you think nail polish would work on those?<</say>>
She reaches for your hand, her touch feather-light as she traces the edge of one claw with the pad of her thumb, her brows furrowed in deep thought. The sensation sends a shiver up your spine, a curious blend of danger and comfort in her touch. Lily is both thrilled and unfazed by the changes in you, treating this journey through the Abyss with the same excitement she might show for an upcoming anime season premiere. It's part of what makes Lily, well, Lily.

:: Lily Drawing Spades

The spectacle of the sixth layer of the Abyss stretches out around you, a dreamlike fusion of color and form. Tentacles of all sizes ripple around you, their alien forms casting otherworldly shadows against the Abyssal obscurity. The soft rustling of their movement forms an eerily calming melody, a stark contrast to the dangerous spikes jutting out from the surfaces of some of the tentacles near you.

<<say $companionLily>>You know, it's not every day you see someone sprout a tail. But with you, I feel like it's Tuesday!<</say>>
Her voice cuts through the low hum of the Abyss, a vibrant note of life amidst the foreign landscape.

You peer back at your new appendage, a sleek tail capped with a heart-like spade. It sways and twines with an autonomy of its own, its gleaming surface reflecting the light around it, every touch of the breeze causing a delightful shudder to roll down your spine.

<<say $mc>>Well, it's not like I had much choice in it. But it's... unique. Unexpected.<</say>>
A joyous, audacious laugh bursts from Lily, resonating within the winding corridors of the Abyss.

<<say $companionLily>>Unexpected, huh? That's one way to put it! But let's be honest, it suits you. You've got this little mischievous demon vibe going on. It's adorable!<</say>>
Her gaze, usually as lively and dynamic as her chitchat, stays on your tail, a hint of fascination flickering within her wide eyes. A tentacle draws near, the thorns scraping against the ebony surface of your tail. You draw back, but Lily is faster, batting the tentacle aside.

<<say $companionLily>>Watch out for those prickly things. Your tail seems sensitive. We wouldn't want anything to hurt it, now would we?<</say>>
A teasing note colors her voice, and her smile broadens as your tail wraps itself fondly around her arm in response.

<<say $mc>>Seems like it's taken a liking to you, Lily.<</say>>
Her laughter echoes once again, light and carefree.

<<say $companionLily>>Well, the feeling's mutual. Now come on, we've got more of this Abyss to explore!<</say>>
With an energetic wave of her hand, Lily blazes the trail, your new tail trailing behind her, as your adventure continues deeper into the heart of the Abyss.

:: Lily Creature

The lights of the cybernetic cityscape dance on the synthetic cobblestones beneath your feet. Pulsating billboards blink down on you, all empty, and the robotic chatter is a strange white noise in the background.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh my gosh, look at you! This is unbelievable!<</say>>
Lily's purple eyes widen to the size of dinner plates, her hair bounces as she hops up and down with an energy that seems insatiable even in the heart of this mechanized metropolis.

<<say $mc>>What? Is there something on my face?<</say>>
You try to find a reflective surface among the corroded steel and polished chrome, catching the sight of your face in the mirror-like surface of a deactivated android nearby. Your skin holds a strange pallor now, an eerie sheen beneath the flashing city lights.

<<say $companionLily>>No, silly, it's just... Well, you're not exactly 'on the sunny side up', are you?<</say>>
She pirouettes around you, her usual grin replaced by a mischievous smirk. She's always been quick with her wit and tongue, but there's a sparkle in her eyes now, a daring challenge.

<<say $mc>>I'm not really in the mood for your jokes, Lily.<</say>>
You frown at her, the discomfort of your condition now slightly prickling under the pale synthetic light.

<<say $companionLily>>Hey, don't be such a downer! You always want to stand out, right? Well, look at you now - the darkest thing in this bright neon city. Quite the scene-stealer!<</say>>
Her giggles ring in the quiet metropolis, a human sound in the monotone robotic harmony.

<<say $mc>>Yeah, a scene-stealer who needs to avoid sunlight and... needs a bit more than just food to survive.<</say>>
You avert your gaze, staring at the shiny surface of the cobblestones.

<<say $companionLily>>Hey, look at me.<</say>>
She gently lifts your chin with her finger, her eyes meeting yours with a twinkle of courage.

<<say $companionLily>>Yes, things are different, and they might get tougher, but you're not alone. We're in this together, remember?<</say>>
Lily's words echo in the silent city, the warmth of her hand a comforting contrast against your cold skin. The confidence in her voice, the optimism in her demeanor, brings a smile to your face, a gleam in your unnatural pallor.

<<say $mc>>You're right, Lily. We're in this together. To the end.<</say>>
You squeeze her hand in reply, your cold touch seeming to invigorate rather than deter her. Her talkative, positive personality is infectious, reminding you that even in the Abyss, even as a Creature of the Night, you aren't alone.

:: Lily Seafolk

Lily approaches, her pink hair bouncing with each step. She plops down beside you, eyeing your finned appendage with unbridled curiosity.

<<say $companionLily>>Wow, that tail is something else! I bet you could win all the swimming competitions now. Have you tried seeing how fast you can go?<</say>>
You shake your head, feeling a mix of amusement and exasperation at Lily's enthusiasm.

<<say $mc>>Not exactly my top priority right now, Lily. I'm still trying to figure out how to walk... or slither... or whatever it is I'm supposed to do on land.<</say>>
Lily's eyes widen, and she leans in closer, examining your gills.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh, right! I didn't even think about that. But hey, look on the bright side – you're basically a superhero now. Aquaman, but cooler!<</say>>
You can't help but chuckle at her optimism.

<<say $mc>>I appreciate the sentiment, but I'm not sure how useful being a fish person is going to be in the Abyss.<</say>>
Lily taps her chin thoughtfully, then snaps her fingers.

<<say $companionLily>>I've got it! We could totally use your new abilities for underwater treasure hunting. Imagine all the sunken loot we could find! It'd be like a real-life adventure movie!<</say>>
You raise an eyebrow, both amused and slightly concerned by her wild imagination.

<<say $mc>>Lily, I don't think—<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>Oh! Or we could start a traveling circus act. 'The Amazing <<if $mc.appGender>5>>Mermaid<<else>>Merman<</if>> and Their Pink-Haired Assistant!' We'd make a fortune!<</say>>
Despite your predicament, you find yourself laughing at Lily's outlandish ideas. Her infectious energy is hard to resist.

<<say $mc>>You're incorrigible, you know that?<</say>>
Lily grins, giving you a playful wink.

<<say $companionLily>>That's why you keep me around, right? But seriously, are you doing okay? I know this whole curse thing must be pretty overwhelming.<</say>>
Her sudden shift to genuine concern catches you off guard. You take a moment to consider your response.

<<say $mc>>It's... challenging. But I suppose if anyone can find the silver lining in this situation, it's you, Lily.<</say>>
She beams at you, then unexpectedly reaches out to pat your tail. The sensation is strange and unfamiliar - her touch feels muted through your scales, yet you can sense the gentle pressure and warmth of her hand. It's an odd mix of foreign and comforting.

<<say $companionLily>>That's the spirit! And hey, if all else fails, we can always find a nice lake for you to retire in. I'll visit and bring you sushi! There are plenty of those on the surface and the first few layers, when we manage to get back up there!<</say>>
You can't help but smile, grateful for Lily's unique brand of support.

:: Lily Seafolk Carry

As you struggle to move across the uneven terrain, your tail dragging uselessly behind you, Lily watches with a mix of concern and determination.

<<say $companionLily>>This isn't working at all, is it? Come on, let me help you out!<</say>>
Before you can protest, Lily bends down and scoops you up in her arms with surprising ease. Your tail dangles awkwardly, but you find yourself securely held against her chest.

<<say $mc>>Lily! I... I didn't realize you were this strong.<</say>>
She grins, adjusting her grip to make sure you're comfortable.

<<say $companionLily>>Hey, don't underestimate me just because I'm cute! Now, where to, <<if $mc.appGender>5>>my lady of the sea<<else>>my lord of the waves<</if>>?<</say>>
You can't help but feel a mix of gratitude and embarrassment as Lily starts walking, carrying you effortlessly.

<<say $mc>>I appreciate this, but... it's a bit humiliating, being so helpless.<</say>>
Lily's expression softens, but her stride remains steady.

<<say $companionLily>>Don't think of it as being helpless. You're just... temporarily land-challenged! Besides, what are friends for if not to be your personal transport when you suddenly grow a fish tail?<</say>>
Despite your situation, you find yourself chuckling at her upbeat attitude.

<<say $mc>>I suppose you're right. Thanks, Lily.<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>Anytime! Just remember, when we find a big pool of water, you're going to have to return the favor and give me a ride!<</say>>
As Lily carries you onwards, you realize that while your new form has its challenges, having someone you can trust like her makes the journey a little bit easier.

:: Khemia Shrunken Assets

Morning light filters through the trees above, casting an strange glow over the odd flora and curious geology of the Abyss's first layer. Every leaf, every rock, every crevice shimmers in the shifting light, creating a landscape that feels both hauntingly beautiful and disturbingly uncanny.

You sit at the base of a towering tree, your back resting against its warm, pulsating bark. The usually comforting thrum of life in the Abyss feels like a distant echo today, drowned out by your own inner turmoil.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Alright, friend, we need to talk.<</say>>
Khemia starts, his normally jovial tone tainted with concern. He's kneeling before you, his broad, scarred hands resting on his sturdy thighs. His keen, brown eyes regard you with a gentleness that you find both comforting and unnerving.

You avoid his gaze, your hands idly picking at the multi-hued grass beneath you. The vibrant blades seem dull and lackluster today, a mirror to your current state.

<<say $mc>>What's there to talk about, Khemia?<</say>>
You deflect his question, your voice barely more than a whisper.

Khemia sighs, the sound echoing through the otherwise silent forest, adding a melancholic soundtrack to the conversation.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Your change... I've noticed it. It's part of the Abyss. Always has been.<</say>>
He shifts, his hand reaching out to catch one of the leaves falling from the canopy, his muscles rippling with controlled power. His every move radiates a strength and confidence that you envy right now.

<<say $mc>>I... I feel less... I don't know... attractive? Powerful?<</say>>
You confess to him, choking on your own insecurity.

Khemia chuckles softly, his gaze softening as he holds the glowing leaf out to you.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Hey, look at this leaf. You'd think it's less 'powerful' than the tree it came from, right?<</say>>
You reach out hesitantly, taking the delicate object from him. It pulses gently in your hand, casting a soft shadow onto your shrunken assets.

<<say $companionKhemia>>But it's not. It carries within it the same strength, the same resilience. It's no less part of the Abyss than the tree it fell from. Same goes for you. Your worth, your power isn't defined by your physical attributes, but by your heart, your courage, and the strength of your spirit.<</say>>
Khemia's warm, confident voice cuts through your self-doubt, instilling a sense of peace and reassurance. His strong, masculine demeanor doesn't waver, even in the face of your transformation, proving his words to be more than mere platitudes.

:: Khemia Sex Switcheroo MtF

The persistent drizzle of the second layer of the Abyss is a constant background noise, the forest's thick canopy barely keeping the rain at bay. The intense humidity of the region clings to your newly feminine form, your clothing soaked through and sticking to your skin. Tall ferns and undergrowth caress your softer, curvier legs with every step, a foreign but not entirely unpleasant sensation.

<<say $companionKhemia>>You're moving a bit differently, aren't you?<</say>>
Khemia's eyes twinkle with good-natured teasing, his voice resonating deep within the rainforest ambiance. His muscular form towers over you, emanating a warmth that contrasts against the cool forest air.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Almost like you're testing out new shoes. Got some bounce in your... step, haven't you?<</say>>
You blush, acutely aware of the gentle bob of new curves and breasts that match his comment. His observation, accurate as it is, brings a heat to your cheeks you hadn't quite expected.

<<say $mc>>I guess I am still getting used to... things. Everything feels so different now.<</say>>
The rich sound of Khemia's laughter echoes through the trees, and he clasps you on the shoulder, his strong grip both reassuring and playful.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Different isn't always a bad thing, you know? It's all a part of being an Abyss adventurer, embracing change and all that jazz.<</say>>
Khemia's grin broadens, his eyes taking on a confident glint.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Sure, your form has changed, but that's just physical. You're still the same tough, determined person inside. And that's what counts.<</say>>
The denseness of the rainforest seems to pause, the constant hum of insects quieting in the backdrop of his uplifting words. You feel a wave of gratitude towards your companion, your worries easing under his steady reassurance.

<<say $mc>>Thank you, Khemia. Your words mean a lot to me. I guess I'll just have to embrace this change and move forward.<</say>>
Khemia's eyes soften, his usually jovial demeanor giving way to a moment of genuine warmth.

<<say $companionKhemia>>That's the spirit! Remember, the Abyss is a place of transformation. Everyone comes out different than they went in.<</say>>

:: Khemia Sex Switcheroo FtM

The dense rainforest of the second layer of the Abyss surrounds you, its vibrant greens and exotic wildlife creating an atmosphere both mysterious and alluring. As you walk through the undergrowth, your new male body feels odd, but strangely empowering. The continually dripping dew fills the air with a rejuvenating scent.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, I must say, you look quite different today. You're really pulling off that new masculine look, if I may say so! Did you get taller, too?<</say>>
Khemia flashes a wide grin, showcasing his friendly demeanor and confident attitude.

<<say $mc>>Thanks, Khemia. It's certainly a change, but I'm starting to get used to it. I don't think I've gained any height though.<</say>>
Khemia nods and scratches his chin, thoughtfully observing you.

<<say $companionKhemia>>You know, I've seen my fair share of transformations in the Abyss, but yours has to be one of the most remarkable. You're like a completely different person, but you've still got that same spirit, and I admire that.<</say>>
His eyes sparkle with sincerity and curiosity.

<<say $mc>>It's been a strange experience, but I'm glad to have you by my side, Khemia. Your support means a lot to me.<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Of course! We adventurers need to stick together, no matter the challenges or changes we face. Now, as a fellow man, I think it's time I taught you some swordplay. How about it?<</say>>
Khemia pats his sword hilt and offers you a teasing smirk.

<<say $mc>>I'd love that. Let's get started!<</say>>
As you follow Khemia deeper into the rainforest, his masculine energy and contagious enthusiasm keep your spirits high. The warm light filters through the canopy above, casting dappled light on the two of you as you learn the art of the sword from a true master.

:: Khemia Gooey

The echo of your gooey footfalls resounds in the dimly lit cavern, each step leaving a small, shimmering imprint on the ancient stone floor. You watch as it slowly reabsorbs back into your form - a feature of your recent transformation. An eerie, ambient light is reflecting off your new gooey form, casting an otherworldly glow around the cavern.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, you're certainly not going unnoticed, are you?<</say>>
Khemia chuckles, his masculine voice filling the cavern with a resonant mirth. His rugged features, barely discernible in the dim light, are pulled into a grin as he observes you. Despite his jovial demeanor, you notice a subtle edge of uncertainty in his gaze.

<<say $mc>>Yeah, I guess it's a bit hard to blend in now, isn't it?<</say>>
Your words bubble out of your goo form, carrying a strange resonance. It's a surreal experience, seeing your own words ripple across your new form before vanishing into the ether.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Just a smidge.<</say>>
He steps closer, his heavy boots crunching on the gravel beneath, contrasting your silent, gooey tread. He pauses, a momentary hitch in his confident stride as he looks at you. You notice his Adam's apple bob in a dry swallow - a glimpse of an uncharacteristic discomfort.

<<say $mc>>Does it bother you, Khemia?<</say>>
Your question is more a statement than an inquiry. His normally unwavering gaze is oddly... jittery. Even the stalwart adventurer has his apprehensions, it seems.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Me? Nah, nothing much gets to me, you know that. But, uh... it's definitely different.<</say>>
He gives you a crooked grin, running a hand through his disheveled hair. His confident posture seems to slightly falter for a moment, but he quickly regains it, straightening up and puffing out his chest.

<<say $mc>>But that doesn't mean it's bad, right?<</say>>
As you say this, your gooey hand morphs into an approximation of a thumbs-up, a glistening gesture of reassurance.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Right you are! We'll just have to stick together, won't we?<</say>>
There's a hearty laugh in his words, even as he sidesteps a stray glob of goo on the cavern floor. His eyes meet yours, a glimmer of unspoken camaraderie in them, despite his earlier hesitation.

:: Khemia Reptail

A faint crunch echoes with every footstep you take as you walk through the fourth floor, the new weight and balance from the appendage at your back making your walk a bit more deliberate.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, aren't you a sight? Looks like the Abyss has really given you a souvenir.<</say>>
Khemia's voice rumbles, warm and reassuring against the biting cold. The grin on his face, despite the treacherous conditions, holds no mockery, only open fascination and a spark of excitement.

A sweeping gust of wind cuts your response short, and you pull the edges of your cloak tighter, the new scales on your tail instinctively bristling against the cold. You can't help but feel the Abyss staring at your new form, a keen observer as always.

<<say $mc>>I suppose it has. Not exactly what I expected from our journey, though.<</say>>
Khemia's hearty laughter echoes across the snowy landscape, his breath creating misty plumes in the freezing air. He is a figure of unfazed confidence in this icy expanse, seemingly unaffected by the biting chill. His gloved hand slaps your shoulder companionably.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Expected? No one ever truly knows what to expect from the Abyss. That's part of the thrill, isn't it?<</say>>
His gaze travels from the crest of your reptilian tail to the point where it emerges from the small of your back. Curiosity lights up his eyes, but he doesn't shy away from the unfamiliarity. Instead, his hand reaches out, a silent question hanging between you.

<<say $mc>>Just be careful, it's more sensitive than I expected.<</say>>
With a nod of acknowledgement, his roughened fingers trace the ridges of your tail, the leather of his gloves a stark contrast to the smooth scales. A low whistle escapes his lips, as he takes in the sheer detail of the transformation.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Incredible... The Abyss might be mysterious, but it sure doesn't skimp on the details.<</say>>
Khemia steps back, hands falling to rest on his hips as he surveys your new form. The ghost of his touch lingers on your tail, making you hyper-aware of the chill wind, the snow beneath your boots, the looming Abyss around you.

<<say $companionKhemia>>We'll adapt. That's what we do. Whatever the Abyss throws our way, we handle it. You're no less of an adventurer now, if anything... you're more.<</say>>
His words ring through the snowy landscape, a promise and a challenge rolled into one. You find yourself mirroring his confident smile, your tail swaying behind you.

:: Khemia Pheromones

A bead of sweat trickles down your brow, gliding down your neck, following the trail of a strange new scent. A scentless pheromone, but a call none could ignore. You are the epicenter of a newfound aura, your body exuding an alluring influence that neither you nor anyone else can deny.

<<say $companionKhemia>>You know, there's something about you that's been teasing the edge of my thoughts. You've got an... energy about you. Something magnetic.<</say>>
Khemia's confident gaze sweeps over you, his eyes glinting like chips of obsidian in the harsh sunlight. His sharp scrutiny is as piercing as it is alluring, sparking an anticipatory thrill that makes your heart flutter. His jaw clenches, the sunlight catching on the scruff of his stubble, highlighting the tension in his muscular form.

<<say $mc>>And what's your take on this... energy?<</say>>
You watch Khemia as he digs the tip of his sword into the sand, his broad shoulders rolling as he shifts his weight from one foot to another. His strong, rugged face has a faint sheen of sweat glistening on his skin.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, I'd say it's got me wanting to know you a little better. Makes a man think about things. Maybe things he hasn't thought about in a while.<</say>>
His words are spoken with a playful grin that softens his otherwise stern face. His teasing tone hints at a certain camaraderie between you two, and though he doesn't say it outright, you can sense his growing interest.

<<say $mc>>Well, what exactly does that mean?<</say>>
With a hearty chuckle, Khemia winks at you, his eyes twinkling in the sunlight. He tosses a small pebble in your direction, which you catch with an easy smile.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Guess you'll have to stick around and find out, won't you?<</say>>
As you journey through the desert, your shared glances, playful banter, and lingering touches reveal a tension that wasn't there before.

:: Khemia Seafolk

Your newly acquired tail curls beneath you, the scales glistening in the dim light as you spot Khemia approaching you.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Hey there, fish-legs! How're you holding up with that new... appendage?<</say>>
He grins, his eyes twinkling with a mix of concern and curiosity. You can't help but notice his gaze lingering on your tail.

<<say $mc>>I'm still getting used to it, to be honest. How do you think this will affect our expedition?<</say>>
Khemia runs a hand through his hair, his expression turning thoughtful.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, I've seen my fair share of curses down here, but this one's pretty unique. But it could be a blessing in disguise, you know?<</say>>
He paces around you, studying your new form with the keen eye of an experienced explorer.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Think about it - we're bound to encounter underwater passages. With those gills, you could scout ahead without worrying about air supply. It's like having our very own mermaid guide!<</say>>
You raise an eyebrow, not entirely convinced by his enthusiasm.

<<say $mc>>I appreciate the optimism, Khemia, but I'm not exactly built for land travel anymore. How am I supposed to keep up with you on dry ground?<</say>>
Khemia's face lights up, and he snaps his fingers.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Ah, but that's where teamwork comes in! Once a diver was with was struck by a Curse that made his skin turn to stone for most of the day. We had to carry him for pretty long stretches, but we made it work. Now it's my turn to have your back... or should I say, tail?<</say>>
He chuckles at his own joke, then kneels beside you, his expression softening.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Look, I know it's not easy. Curses rarely are. But we're explorers, right? We adapt. We overcome. And hey, if anyone can make the most of a fishy situation, it's us.<</say>>
His words, though lighthearted, carry the weight of experience. You find yourself smiling despite your concerns.

<<say $mc>>You're right. We've faced worse. So, what's the plan? How do we change our strategy?<</say>>
Khemia's eyes light up with excitement as he explains some ways you can overcome common obstacles. It will take more time, but it should be possible at least.

You can't help but feel reassured by his confidence. Khemia's optimism and creativity are infectious, and you feel a renewed sense of determination.

<<say $mc>>Sounds like a plan. As long as you promise not to tell stories about 'the one that got away' while carrying me around.<</say>>
Khemia throws his head back in laughter, his red cape fluttering with the movement.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Deal! Though I can't promise I won't come up with a few fish puns along the way.<</say>>

As you and Khemia continue your journey through the Abyss, you soon encounter a steep, rocky incline. Your new tail, while perfect for swimming, proves to be a significant hindrance on land.
<<say $mc>>Khemia, I... I don't think I can make it up this slope.<</say>>
You feel a mix of frustration and embarrassment as you struggle to move forward. Khemia turns back, his blue hair catching the dim light as he assesses the situation.
<<say $companionKhemia>>Don't worry, fish-legs. I've got just the solution.<</say>>

As you stop at your camp on this particularly peaceful night, Lily approaches you.

<<say $companionLily>>This place is... magical, isn't it?<</say>>
Her voice, low and soft, seems to blend seamlessly with the faint hum of the Abyss.

<<say $mc>>Well, then it's just like you, Lily.<</say>>
The words hang in the air for a moment, a confession unspoken yet palpable. She glances at you, surprise widening her eyes before a tender smile curves her lips. She reaches out, her fingertips grazing your tail as her eyes hold yours. You feel a shiver of pleasure at her touch, the sensation stronger, more profound than you could have imagined.

<<say $companionLily>>Your tail... it's...<</say>>
Her words fade, yet her eyes remain fixed on your tail, her hand tracing its sleek form, sending shivers down your spine.

<<say $mc>>It's what?<</say>>
Your question hangs between you, an invitation for her to explore, to dive into the intimacy of the moment.

<<say $companionLily>>It's beautiful. And it feels... incredible. Do you feel this?<</say>>
Her hand traces a path along the tail's length, causing your breath to hitch, the sensation sparking within you like a line of fire. A nod is all you can manage, the sensation of her touch overwhelming.

Her laughter echoes again, lighter now, laced with a note of desire. Slowly, deliberately, she wraps your tail around her waist, pulling you closer. The contact sends a jolt of pleasure through you, your pulse quickening at the closeness.

Her lips find yours in the Abyssal half-light, a soft exploration that quickly grows more urgent. Her hand continues its exploration of your tail, every caress sending waves of pleasure radiating through you.

<<say $mc>>Lily...<</say>>
Your words are cut short as she finds your lips once again, her hand buried in your hair, pulling you closer. The rest of the world, the Abyss, and all its alien landscapes fade into the background.

It is just you and Lily, bodies entwined, hearts beating as one, lost in the heart of the Abyss.

:: Lily Tail Romance 2

As your lips break apart, you both are panting, lost in the close-knit universe of the two of you. The moment hangs heavy with an electric intimacy, your shared breaths punctuating the silence of the Abyss.

<<say $companionLily>>Your tail... it's reacting to me, isn't it?<</say>>
Her voice is hushed, but the underlying playful tone is unmistakable. She glances at your tail, still wrapped around her waist, a spark of curiosity in her eyes.

<<say $mc>>It seems so. It's... it's more sensitive than I realize.<</say>>
Her hand gently strokes the length of your tail, each touch sending a new wave of pleasure coursing through your body.

<<say $companionLily>>You trust me, right?<</say>>
The question takes you by surprise, but you nod, unable to form words. Her grin widens as her hand traces the length of your tail, her eyes full of mischief and delight.

Lily releases your tail from her waist, her hands gliding over the gleaming surface with an air of reverence. Holding the spade end in her hands, she tilts her head, her gaze moving from it to you, a silent question.

<<say $mc>>Go ahead...<</say>>
Encouraged by your permission, she brings your tail closer to her mouth. Her breath causes a shiver of anticipation to run down its length. She gently parts her lips and begins to suck on the tip of your tail.

A groan escapes your lips, the unexpected sensation overwhelming your senses. The feeling is intense, a unique blend of pleasure that sends shockwaves through your entire body.

Her words come out between breaths, sending a different type of thrill through you. Her playful tone, coupled with the unexpected pleasure from her actions, heightens your desire.

Lily keeps her eyes on you as she continues her ministrations, the suction of her mouth on your tail creating a potent sensation. Her hands maintain a firm hold on the appendage, her thumb tracing soft patterns against the sensitive skin.

The combination of the visual, the intimacy of the act, and the unique pleasure it gives is intoxicating. It pulls you deeper into a vortex of desire, and you find yourself lost in a maelstrom of sensation. The Abyss and its eerie beauty are forgotten; in that moment, the only thing that matters is Lily, her lips on your tail, and the electrifying connection between the two of you.

You reach out, intertwining your fingers with hers, grounding yourself in the overwhelming sea of sensations. With a last suck, she lets go of your tail, the sudden loss leaving you bereft.

<<say $companionLily>>Your tail... It's different, unique, and a little bit strange. But it's part of you, and I like it... I like all of you.<</say>>
Her voice is soft, barely audible over the hum of the Abyss. But her words strike you, a confession that echoes within your heart, entwining you deeper with the audacious, adorable girl in front of you.

<<say $mc>>And I like you, Lily.<</say>>
She beams at you, and it is more radiant than any glow of the miasmal light.

<<say $companionLily>>How was that, $mc.name? A thrilling enough adventure for you?<</say>>
Her voice carries the typical playful lilt, though there's a hint of satisfaction in her tone. She looks at you, eyes sparkling with a mischievous glint, her smile hinting at the shared intimacy of the moment.

Your heart pounds in your chest as you make camp with Khemia, the Abyss' notorious adventurer. There's a newfound energy about him, a tangible sense of control that hums in the air around him, having obtained the Power Dom Curse. His presence, stronger than ever, stirs a mixture of apprehension and curiosity within you.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Adventures in the Abyss aren't only about danger and unknowns, there's also... well, let's say some hidden perks.<</say>>
Khemia's gaze flickers over you, playful yet demanding, a clear reflection of his newfound power. His muscular form rests comfortably against the rocky underground wall, a wicked smirk playing on his lips.

<<say $mc>>Perks? What kind of perks are you talking about?<</say>>
Your voice wavers slightly under his dominant aura. You feel a strange, unfamiliar heat spreading throughout your body.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Oh, I think you might be interested in this one. I want you to touch me.<</say>>
He speaks with an assertive yet charming grin, an intriguing blend of commanding and inviting. His eyes hold yours, drawing you in with an unspoken promise of mutual pleasure.

Despite the unexpectedness, there's something strangely appealing about the request, something thrilling about the command that triggers a shiver of anticipation. Swallowing hard, you reach over, your hand shaking slightly as it hovers above his lap.

Feeling the heat of his body through his pants, your fingers tremble against the material. His breath hitches as you make contact, the sudden stiffness under your touch makes your heart skip a beat.

<<say $mc>>Like this?<</say>>
Your voice is barely a whisper, your entire focus on the reaction you're provoking in him.

<<say $companionKhemia>>That's it... Just like that. Don't be shy.<</say>>
His voice is low, encouraging, the undercurrent of arousal tangible. His hand reaches out to cover yours, guiding your movements.

As you stroke him through his pants, the hardness beneath your hand leaves no doubt about his desire. The thick, solid length of him pulses against your touch, and the feeling is both intimidating and exhilarating.

His breath deepens as you follow his guidance, his features reflect a sense of satisfaction and pleasure. You feel a sense of pride stirring in you. You're doing this to him, you're bringing Khemia, the Abyss' most skilled swordsman, to his knees.

<<say $companionKhemia>>You're doing good... better than good, actually.<</say>>
His confident, masculine voice comes out in a deep growl, his gaze never leaving yours. The pleasure on his face mirrors your own, the heat between you growing with every word, every touch.

In this moment, despite his dominance, there's a sense of equal footing between you. This isn't just about his newfound dominance. It's about trust, about exploring the Abyss together, in more ways than one.

After all, every great adventure requires a bit of unexpected thrill.

Your movements continue under Khemia's guidance, his breath growing more ragged, his muscular body taut under the increasing pleasure. You watch him, his handsome face flushed with desire, eyes half-closed, lost in the sensation.

<<say $mc>>Is this... alright?<</say>>
Your voice barely cuts through the heavy silence, almost drowned out by the sound of his deep, ragged breaths.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's... it's perfect... just... don't stop.<</say>>
His words come out in a strained whisper, each syllable interrupted by sharp intakes of breath.

Then, with a stifled groan, his body stiffens, his grip on your hand tightening. His release is intense, his whole body shaking, a testimony to your actions.

Catching his breath, Khemia leans back against the wall of the Abyss, his intense gaze softening. There's a shared understanding between you, a quiet satisfaction. The experience was new, strange, but incredibly intimate. A bond forged not just in the face of danger, but in shared pleasure too.

<<say $companionKhemia>>That was... remarkable. You continue to surprise me, $mc.name.<</say>>
His voice, roughened by his recent climax, holds a note of genuine admiration.

<<say $mc>>I... I'm glad you enjoyed it. I did too.<</say>>
Your voice is shy but there's a newfound confidence in your words.

<<say $companionKhemia>>I thought you might. Remember, this is a two-way street. We're in this Abyss together, aren't we?<</say>>
His grin is back, the playful adventurer replaced by the familiar companion, yet holding the newfound dynamic between you two.

This is only the beginning of your adventure with Khemia. You can't help but wonder, with anticipation and a little bit of fear, what else the Abyss has in store for you both. But one thing is certain, whatever comes, you'll face it together.

:: Cherry Dom Oral Female

You look at Cherry, the gray hue of her eyes reflecting the perpetual exhaustion she wears like a shroud. There's a vulnerability to her that's always been there, but somehow it feels more pronounced now, more accessible. A twist from the Abyss courses through you, filling you with an unusual certainty and dominance.

<<say $mc>>Cherry, come here.<</say>>
She glances at you, her gaze dull but obedient, moving slowly towards you. A small shiver runs down your spine, anticipation tingling across your skin.

<<say $companionCherry>>What do you need?<</say>>
Her voice is quiet, almost a whisper. The usual monotone carries a hint of curiosity.

<<say $mc>>Kneel.<</say>>
A blink, but she doesn't argue, doesn't hesitate. She descends gracefully, her eyes never leaving yours. Your breath hitches, your senses heightened, each small action gaining new weight and meaning.

You can feel the heat coursing through you, a growing, hungry heat. Your body responds instinctively to the subtle shift in dynamics.

<<say $mc>>Undress me.<</say>>
Cherry's hands are cold but steady as they work to remove your clothes. The slow slide of fabric against skin sends a chill up your spine, pooling low in your belly, a delicious contrast to the heat.

Once you're bare before her, you see her eyes flit across your body, taking in your nudity without comment. Your fingers twine in her hair, your grip firm.

<<say $mc>>Make me feel good, Cherry.<</say>>
Her lips press against your inner thigh, her breath cool against the heated skin. A tremor runs through you as her mouth nears your core. Her tongue is a cold shock, her movements slow, deliberate.

You guide her with your hand, the grip in her hair tightening, a silent reminder of your control. Your other hand settles on her shoulder, a contrasting soft touch, an anchor grounding you amidst the onslaught of sensation.

She's attentive, careful, her movements measured and slow. But there's something missing, a spark of life that's absent from her actions. Your dominance compels you to seek it, to demand more of her than simple obedience.

<<say $mc>>Enjoy it, Cherry. I want to see you enjoy it.<</say>>
Your words hang in the air between you, a challenge. For a moment, she's still, her breath ghosting over your slick folds. And then, slowly, her lips part in a small, surprised 'o', her eyes sparkling with the faintest glint of something.

As she continues, there's a difference in her actions. They're still slow, still careful, but there's a hunger there now, a growing desire mirrored in the slow, steady build of pleasure in your core.

Your breaths come in sharp gasps, your grip in her hair tightening as waves of pleasure start to roll over you. The world narrows down to the sensation of her mouth on you, her hands gripping your thighs, the heat building within you.

As you crest over the edge of your pleasure, Cherry remains there, her lips soft and comforting. Your hands release their grip on her, instead carding through her hair gently, a soothing counterpoint to your earlier dominance.

<<say $mc>>Good girl, Cherry.<</say>>
Your voice is low, warm, the newfound dominance making room for something softer, something that glows with the satisfaction of having elicited something beyond mere compliance from the normally impassive Cherry.

:: Cherry Dom Oral Male

As you finish setting up camp for the night, there's Cherry - a quiet, depressed girl, her eyes holding a perpetual glimmer of melancholy. Her words are usually flat, her reactions muted. But today, as the effects of the Abyss ripple through you, you can't help but feel a spark of desire towards her, a desire to command, to dominate.

<<say $companionCherry>>Everything's just... kind of grey, you know?<</say>>
Cherry's voice is quiet and flat, not an unusual tone for her. She has a distinct slouch to her posture and a weary look in her eyes. Her fingers idly twirl a lock of hair.

You take in her words, the new-found dominance pulsating within you. You're not sure exactly how the Abyss did this, but your confidence has surged, and so have your desires.

<<say $mc>>Cherry.<</say>>
Your voice resonates in the eerie silence of the Abyss.

<<say $mc>>Look at me.<</say>>
She raises her gaze to meet yours, surprise flickering in her usually vacant eyes.

<<say $companionCherry>>Wha... what is it?<</say>>
A hint of curiosity seeping into her otherwise monotone voice.

You stare at her, feeling a heat surge through your body as your dominant side takes hold.

<<say $mc>>I need you, Cherry.<</say>>
You take a step closer to her.

<<say $mc>>Right now.<</say>>
She blinks, looking stunned for a moment, before a faint blush paints her cheeks. The tone of your voice is commanding, and it stirs something in her, a little spark that's been buried under her depression.

<<say $companionCherry>>You... you do?<</say>>
Her voice is a soft murmur, but her eyes remain locked with yours.

Your answer is a silent nod, a determined look in your eyes. The anticipation begins to build within you, your body reacting to the tantalizing prospect of her touch.

<<say $mc>>I want your mouth, Cherry.<</say>>
You unzip your trousers and orient them towards her face.

You watch as she hesitates for a moment, then slowly sinks to her knees in front of you. Her hand is shaky as it reaches out to touch you, but there's a newfound determination in her eyes.

The sensation of her warm hand grasping your penis sends a thrill through your body. She looks up at you, her big eyes seeming a little less empty now. She sticks out her tongue tentatively, as if gauging your reaction.

Feeling her warm, soft tongue begin to glide along the length of your shaft makes your breath hitch. Her tongue is surprisingly skilled, drawing small circles around the sensitive tip of your penis, which makes your heart pound. You reach down to grip her hair, not rough, but firm.

<<say $mc>>That's it, Cherry. Just like that.<</say>>
You murmur, enjoying the sight of her. Her depression is still there, etched into the furrows of her brow, but for a moment, she seems to forget about it, too engrossed in pleasing you. Her mouth opens, taking in more of you, and you feel a flush spread through your body as she starts to suck. It's a strange contrast, her gloomy demeanor and this intimate act, but it stirs your desire even more.

<<say $companionCherry>>Mmm...<</say>>
Her voice is muffled, her mouth filled with your penis. She looks up at you with half-lidded eyes, a hint of eagerness slipping through her usual apathy.

Your heart pounds in your chest as you direct her movements, your fingers tangled in her hair. The warmth of her mouth, the wet slide of her tongue, and the slightly uncomfortable pressure of her teeth send a wave of pleasure coursing through your veins.

<<say $mc>>Cherry... I'm getting close.<</say>>
You warn her, your grip in her hair tightening. The pulsating pleasure is building up, and you feel like you're on the brink.

She doesn't stop, her eyes still locked with yours, her movements only becoming more fervent. The sight of her, kneeling before you, the spark in her eyes, and the feeling of her mouth push you over the edge.

As you come, your knees go weak, and a low moan escapes your lips. The grip you have on her hair loosens, and you watch her swallow before she pulls away, her cheeks a little flushed.

<<say $companionCherry>>Did... did I do okay?<</say>>
She asks you with her voice barely above a whisper.

You can't help but smile, leaning down to cup her face and give her a reassuring nod. The changes from the Abyss might have been strange, but moments like this... they're worth it.

<<say $mc>>You did great, Cherry. Really great.<</say>>
Her lips quirk up in a small smile, and you can't help but think that this is one of the few times you've seen her genuinely happy.

:: Khemia Aegis 1

The soft glow of the campfire flickers, casting dancing shadows on Khemia's ruggedly handsome face. His amber eyes gleam with a mix of determination and excitement as he stares at the mysterious artifact laying beside you.

<<say $companionKhemia>>That Relic you've got there, the Aegis Coffin... it's something else, isn't it?<</say>>
He reaches over, tracing his fingertips over the enigmatic carvings on the coffin's lid, his face reflecting a spark of awe.

<<say $mc>>Yes, it is. Quite useful on this sort of journey. <</say>>
Khemia nods, his gaze still firmly on the coffin.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It would make a man invincible, don't you think? I mean, imagine wielding a sword with an orichalcum skeleton. You'd be indestructible.<</say>>
He grins, the idea clearly intriguing him.

<<say $mc>>Well, invincible is a stretch. But it would definitely make you stronger, more resistant to injury. Why do you ask?<</say>>
Khemia hesitates for a moment, as if wrestling with his thoughts, before he finally looks up at you with a sincere expression.

<<say $companionKhemia>>I've been thinking... I want to reach the bottom of the Abyss, and I'm sure you do too. If I could use the Aegis Coffin, I could become stronger. I could protect you, protect us, better. Would you let me?<</say>>
His voice holds a rare tone of vulnerability. Khemia, the fearless adventurer, is asking for the player's help. This is a journey where they both need to rely on each other, after all.

[[Agree to let him use the Aegis Coffin|Khemia Aegis Yes 1]]

:: Khemia Aegis Yes 1

You look at Khemia, then at the Aegis Coffin, contemplating his request. After a moment, you offer him a reassuring smile.
<<say $mc>>If it means you'll be able to protect yourself better and we can continue this journey, then yes. You can use the Aegis Coffin.<</say>>

Khemia's face lights up instantly, his grin widening as relief washes over him. He quickly reaches out, clasping your hand in gratitude.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Thank you, truly. I'll use this chance wisely, I promise.<</say>>
As Khemia steps into the Aegis Coffin, you can't help but feel a sense of unease. But you have trust in your friend and hope for a successful transformation.

[[The next morning you check on Khemia|Khemia Aegis Yes 2]]


:: Khemia Aegis Yes 2

The next morning, Khemia emerges from the Aegis Coffin. His body seems different, stronger. His old skeleton, made of mere bone, lies neatly beside him, a memorial of what he once was.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, this is certainly a strange souvenir...<</say>>
He holds his old skeleton with a fascinated expression, marveling at the thought that these fragile bones once held him together. With his newly transformed orichalcum skeleton, Khemia is ready to face the deeper Abyss, stronger and more determined than ever.

<<say $mc>>It's definitely an unusual keepsake. But you're stronger now, Khemia. We're one step closer to reaching the bottom of the Abyss.<</say>>
The strengthened adventurer nods, his smile unwavering.

:: Khemia Aegis No

You pause, searching Khemia's face. His eyes are earnest, pleading even. But you have to consider the consequences, the risks, and the unknowns that lie within the Abyss.

<<say $mc>>Khemia, I understand why you want to use it, but I can't let you. We don't know enough about the potential side effects of the Aegis Coffin, and I won't risk your life on a gamble.<</say>>
Khemia's expression falters, disappointment flashing briefly across his face. But he quickly recomposes himself, a small, faltering smile struggling across his lips.

<<say $companionKhemia>>I see... You're right. We shouldn't take unnecessary risks. I appreciate your concern, though. Let's keep moving forward.<</say>>
You nod, relieved that Khemia accepts your decision, but he doesn't seem happy about it. This journey through the Abyss is dangerous enough, there's no need for unnecessary risks.

:: Saeko Layer4 Convo

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/SaekoL4.png']]

The desolate landscape of the fourth layer is a pristine wilderness, a blanket of snow unmarred by footprints, stretching into the fog-laden horizon. Occasional glacial mountains peak above the sheet of white, appearing as lonely sentinels in the deserted expanse. Sparse, stunted vegetation clings tenaciously to life, hardy survivors in a frozen desert.

<<say $companionSaeko>>It's fascinating yet terrifying, isn't it? This layer... it's a cryogenic wonder, one that's eerily beautiful in its own harsh, barren way. But we need to be careful. The Miasma-produced winds can dislodge ice from the ceiling, causing avalanches of snow and hail.<</say>>
Saeko's breath frosts in the air as she speaks, her tone analytical but laced with a touch of apprehension. She stares out at the bleak landscape, her gloved hand absently brushing over a struggling plant, its leaves brittle in the icy chill. Her dark eyes, usually filled with academic curiosity, are now shadowed with concern.

<<say $mc>>It's not just the snow and hail we need to worry about. This cold... it's almost unnatural. It penetrates everything.<</say>>
Your voice emerges in a cloud of vapor, the harsh cold stinging your lungs with every breath. Despite the insulation of your gear, the cold bites at your extremities, an incessant gnawing that refuses to relent.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Yes, I've read about this. The Miasma has some peculiar properties here. It seems to exacerbate the cold, making it far more penetrating than it naturally would be. The Miasma, it's... it's a force, an entity of its own. It's strange how its properties change in different locations.<</say>>
Saeko's words echo in the icy silence, amplifying the sense of isolation in the barren landscape. She huddles closer, her breath hitching as she pulls her coat tighter around herself. The bitter cold seems to accentuate her vulnerability, chipping away at the composed facade she usually holds.

<<say $mc>>We're in this together, Saeko. We'll figure it out.<</say>>
Your words, meant to be comforting, hang in the chilled air. In this harsh environment, they seem to strengthen the bond you share, born out of mutual respect and growing affection. Saeko looks at you, her gaze softening.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I know... and I appreciate it. I've spent years studying the Abyss, but being here... experiencing it firsthand is... different. It's more raw, more real.<</say>>
There is a tremor in her voice, her academic demeanor flickering as she is confronted with the harsh realities of the Abyss. The biting cold, the hostile environment, the unsettling transformations... all feel far more immediate and terrifying than words on a page.

<<say $mc>>That's what makes it an adventure, Saeko. And having you here... that makes it worth it.<</say>>
The words tumble out, a candid confession in the harsh, cold wilderness of the Abyss. The bitter cold suddenly seems a little less biting, the bleak landscape a little less desolate. The shared hardship has brought you closer, sparking a flame of warmth in the icy heart of the Abyss.

:: Saeko Inhuman Affection

The bizarre quietness of the Abyss is punctuated by the sounds of Saeko meticulously noting down observations in her journal, a diligent ritual that has become a comforting background score to your expedition.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I've always been captivated by the lifeforms here, you know?<</say>>
Her voice carries a tinge of reverence. Her eyes never leave the vibrant, bioluminescent flower she's studying - a bulbous plant that gently pulsates with light, reacting to her touch.

You nod, a smile playing on your lips. The massive changes you've undergone in the Abyss are undeniably challenging. The body that once felt like your own now seems more like a ship weathering a constant storm of transformation, the details of which are indescribable. Yet, here you are, standing firm, and in these moments of tranquility, you have begun to appreciate the majesty of this place, much like Saeko does.

<<say $mc>>What made you choose to specialize in Abyssal plants?<</say>>
You finally ask the question that's been lingering in your mind.

Saeko's usually stern face relaxes, and she takes off her glasses, wiping away the light dust accumulated on them. The bioluminescent glow reflects in her eyes, giving them a mysterious depth.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Ah, that's quite a tale. Growing up, my home was near a botanical garden. Every day after school, instead of heading home like other children, I would go there. Fascinated by every leaf, petal, and twig, I'd lose track of time. You could say those plants were my first friends.<</say>>
She pauses, lost in memories.

You watch Saeko with interest, her story adding layers to her personality.

<<say $companionSaeko>>But the moment I learned about the Abyss and its flora, so vastly different from anything I had ever seen, I knew that's where my real journey began. The plants here, their beauty, their resilience...they tell a story of adaptation and survival that we can barely comprehend. I wanted to... no, I needed to understand their secrets.<</say>>
Her voice brims with a passion that transcends the academic, speaking volumes about her love for the Abyss and its unique life forms. It's a side of her you hadn't fully seen before.

<<say $mc>>Your dedication is inspiring, Saeko.<</say>>
A fleeting smile graces her lips, a subtle blush spreading across her cheeks. But she quickly regains her composure.

<<say $companionSaeko>>And you... you're a walking example of the Abyss's power of transformation, aren't you? I must admit, it's intriguing, but also somewhat unsettling.<</say>>
Her gaze rests on you, her scholarly curiosity piqued.

This is the first time Saeko has addressed the changes you've been undergoing. You smile, appreciating her frankness and genuine interest.

<<say $mc>>Yeah, I suppose I am now. Though I'm still myself, not just a scientific specimen.<</say>>
She nods, her gaze returning to the pulsating plant before her.

:: Saeko Inhuman Romance

The miasma-filled air of the Abyss clings to your skin, a thick, tangible reminder of your surroundings. Saeko stands rigid, her fingers wringing nervously, her gaze fixated on your drastically altered form. It's as if an unseen artist has decided to reshape you over the course of your journey, giving birth to a new form, so different yet eerily familiar.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Your transformation is... it's absolutely remarkable, scientifically speaking. I've never witnessed anything like this firsthand.<</say>>
She tries to keep her tone steady, her words analytical. Yet, her voice betrays a hint of anxiety, a tremor that belies her composed scientist exterior. She takes a step back, pushing a loose strand of hair behind her ear in an anxious gesture.

<<say $mc>>I... well, yeah. It feels as remarkable as you say, Saeko. But how do I look?<</say>>
Your voice is calm, though the undercurrent of uncertainty is palpable. Your eyes seek Saeko's in a silent plea for reassurance. The shadows dance across your face, enhancing the eerie beauty of your transformed form.

<<say $companionSaeko>>You... look... different. But not in a negative sense. It's just... unexpected, astonishing really.<</say>>
She stumbles over her words, struggling to maintain her typically methodical articulation. Her gaze softens as she observes you. A pause hangs heavily between you, the low hum of the unseen creatures your only accompaniment.

<<say $mc>>Saeko, you're rambling. Are you alright?<</say>>
The question is gentle, laced with concern. You reach out, your newly formed hand stopping mid-air, uncertain.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I apologize... I'm just... This is a lot to process. I mean, we knew the Abyss could change you, but seeing it, experiencing it... it's another matter entirely.<</say>>
Her voice trails off, and she glances away, her boots scuffing against the rough, alien terrain. Suddenly, she seems smaller, the formidable researcher dwarfed by the weight of your predicament.

<<say $mc>>It is. But we knew what we were getting into, didn't we? We're in this together, Saeko.<</say>>
Your voice is warm, a soothing balm against the chilling reality. You extend your hand fully now, reaching for Saeko's. The glow from the miasma casts a spectral light on your intertwined fingers.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Yes, we are. And I... I care about you, more than I thought I would. More than just a fellow researcher or... or a companion.<</say>>
Her confession hangs in the air, echoing in the silence of the Abyss. She takes a deep breath, her eyes locking with yours.

<<say $mc>>Saeko, I-<</say>>
Before you can finish, Saeko leans in, pressing her lips against yours in a soft, tentative kiss.

You pull away slowly, the kiss still lingering between you. Saeko's eyes are wide, her breath hitching slightly as she gazes at you.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I... I hope that was alright. I've been wanting to... Well, I'm not a doctor yet, but this almost feels like getting involved with a patient, which isn't proper at all.<</say>>
There's a vulnerability in her voice, a departure from her usual academic tone. She's trying to mask her anxiety with humor and her grip on your hand tightens.

<<say $mc>>Maybe not, but it's human, Saeko. We're not just researchers here. We're people too... and I've been wanting to do that as well.<</say>>
A smile spreads across your face, your eyes softening as you look at Saeko. Your grip tightens around her hand once again.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Then we're on the same page. Even amidst all this... change, it's good to know some things remain constant.<</say>>
She returns the smile, a genuine one this time. Your joined hands seem to glow in the eerie light.

Saeko seems to be eyeing you in a different way than usual, with an intense warmth in her gaze that's slowly appeared as you've gotten to know her better.

<<say $companionSaeko>>We've made such a fascinating discoveries down here, haven't we?<</say>>
Her tone is analytical, yet her gaze, which flickers with a spark of heat, indicates a softness that contrasts with her scientific demeanor. Her hand, normally manipulating petri dishes or recording data, now reaches for yours, tracing gentle circles on your palm. You feel an unexpected and potent heat radiating from her touch.

<<say $mc>>Yes, we have, Saeko. But there's more to this place than just data and specimens, isn't there?<</say>>
You watch as her eyes flicker with a quiet understanding. Her fingers tentatively trace their way up your arm, across your shoulder, causing you to shudder as they brush lightly against your skin. Your breath hitches in your throat as her touch descends to your waistband, her touch surprisingly confident.

<<say $companionSaeko>>There is... There's a vitality, a life force in the Abyss that transcends typical biological explanation. Perhaps... we're part of it?<</say>>
Her words are imbued with an uncharacteristic vulnerability. Her hand moves downward, her fingers exploring, tracing your arousal through the fabric of your trousers. Your heart pounds against your chest as you draw in a sharp breath, your body reacting to her boldness.

<<say $mc>>I... I think you're right, Saeko.<</say>>
You feel her fingers deftly undo the button, her breath hitching as she unzips your trousers and you spring free. You feel the cool air of the Abyss against your heated skin. It's a tantalizing sensation that leaves you gasping, your arousal throbbing under her gentle touch.

<<say $companionSaeko>>You're quite... lively. Like the Abyss, vibrant and full of energy.<</say>>
You can't help the small laugh that bubbles up from your throat at her choice of words, her academic nature never quite leaving her. The sensation of her hand encircling you causes your breath to hitch. Her touch is as cautious and curious as the way she approaches her scientific work, exploring you with a slow and attentive pace that has your heart pounding in your chest.

<<say $mc>>Saeko... you're making me feel... incredible.<</say>>
Her thumb sweeps over the tip, your hips bucking involuntarily at the unexpected stimulation. You gasp, your fingers gripping her shoulder. She gazes at you with curiosity, as if cataloguing every reaction.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Your responses are... quite illuminating.<</say>>
Her hand works you with a steady rhythm, her touch firm yet tender. You're overwhelmed by the intense sensations coursing through you, heat spreading through your body like wildfire. Her intellectual approach to your intimate encounter only serves to heighten your arousal, the merging of two worlds – her scientific curiosity and your raw desires – culminating in an electrifying experience that has you teetering on the edge.

<<say $mc>>Saeko... I'm... close.<</say>>
She nods, her touch not faltering as you shudder beneath her. The intense sensations build, your climax approaching with a swiftness that has you gasping. The anticipation is a sweet torture that Saeko seems determined to prolong.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Experience it... just like we do with the mysteries of the Abyss.<</say>>
Her words, so full of academic allure and sensual promise, push you over the edge. You let out a choked gasp as the pleasure crashes over you, your climax an explosion of sensation. Your vision blurs, your breath hitching as you ride out the waves of pleasure.

<<say $mc>>Saeko... that was... amazing.<</say>>
In the afterglow, she gazes at you, her eyes filled with a quiet satisfaction. The adventure through the Abyss had brought forth an unexpected intimacy, a deep connection that was as mysterious and awe-inspiring as the environment around you.

<<say $companionSaeko>>It truly was... a learning experience.<</say>>
Her words, so typically Saeko, bring a smile to your face, the euphoria of your intimate encounter still tingling in your veins. You know that this journey through the Abyss, alongside Saeko, would be far from predictable, and you wouldn't have it any other way.

<<say $companionSaeko>>There is... There's a vitality, a life force in the Abyss that transcends all biological explanation. Perhaps... we're part of it?<</say>>
Her voice is imbued with an uncharacteristic vulnerability. Her hand moves further, her fingers dipping below the waistband of your trousers.

<<say $companionSaeko>>You're quite... lively. Like the Abyss, vibrant and full of energy.<</say>>

:: Khemia Layer6 Convo

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/KhemiaL6.png']]

The villi beneath your feet wriggle and squirm, gently stroking and prodding at your ankles and calves, filling you with an unexpected, alien sense of discomfort.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Never thought you'd see the day when you'd walk on living carpet, huh?<</say>>
Khemia speaks with a slight smirk, his expression revealing both amusement and fascination.

<<say $companionKhemia>>There's always something new waiting for us in the Abyss. Each layer more strange than the last. That's why I can't help but push further. It's a lure I can't resist.<</say>>
The journey continues. As you venture deeper into this bizarre layer, the tentacles grow in size, swarming around your waists and eliciting a mixture of discomfort and intrigue. The ambient temperature climbs steadily, the air becoming hot and heavy, akin to an intense sauna, making every breath a laborious task. Flames dance amidst the fields of tentacles, a strange sight that transforms the environment into an uncanny, fiery hellscape. Oddly, despite the blaze, the heat seems to only lightly tickle your skin, as though you are wrapped in a warm, gentle breeze rather than being in the midst of a wildfire.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Abyss, you continue to outdo yourself!<</say>>
Khemia exclaims, his eyes gleaming with wild excitement. His hand runs over the tip of his sword, fingers tracing the cold metal.

<<say $companionKhemia>>A field of fire, a sea of tentacles, and a burning desire to go even deeper. I won't let anything stop me! I want to know what's waiting for us at the bottom. No, I need to know.<</say>>
Throughout the layer, you spot small pieces of ancient rubble, the remnants of a past civilization or a forgotten era. Yet the tentacles and flames have ravaged them beyond recognition, reducing them to meaningless chunks of stone amidst the living and burning landscape.

<<say $mc>>Khemia, you do realize the risks, right? This is uncharted territory. We're already facing challenges that no one has ever encountered before. Is the unknown really worth risking everything?<</say>>
Khemia turns towards you, his gaze filled with a mix of excitement, determination, and a hint of madness. His flirty nature seems to dissipate for a moment, replaced by an almost palpable gravity.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Yes. It's worth it. Because for adventurers like us, it's not the destination, but the journey that defines us. And I'll do anything, risk everything, to continue this journey to the very end. Even if it's the bottom of the Abyss.<</say>>
There is a silence, a deep pause, filled only with the squelching of the tentacle carpet underfoot and the crackling of the exotic fires nearby. Khemia's words hang in the air, as palpable as the heat. His conviction seems to charge the atmosphere, the tension between you almost tangible.

<<say $mc>>And if it costs you your life? You're ready to pay that price?<</say>>
Khemia's steps falter for a moment, then he steels himself and continues plowing through the navel-high tentacles. He stares into the dancing flames, his eyes reflecting an array of vivid hues from the fire. The backdrop of smoky air and flickering light lends an ethereal quality to his strong features.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Life is a fleeting moment, a glimmer in the endless expanse of time. If I can spend that moment pushing boundaries, exploring unknown territories, and treading where no one else dares, then it would be a life well lived, don't you think?<</say>>
Khemia's reply is met with another silence. As you trek through this bizarre landscape, you can sense the intensity of the Abyss layer growing. The fiery tentacles seem to sway in tandem with your conversation, their intensity reflecting the ardor of your dialogue.

<<say $mc>>That's... one way to look at it. But isn't there anything else you want? Outside of the Abyss?<</say>>
Khemia turns his gaze back from the flames and looks at you. The smirk returns to his face, the charismatic charm sneaking back into his eyes.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Oh, there are plenty of things I want, but right now, I can't think of a better place to be, or a better person to be with. The Abyss and its mysteries... they're part of me. And you... You're part of this journey.<</say>>
Khemia gives you a sly wink, but his return to his typical charming attitude does little to lighten the gravity of the conversation. But it is a reminder of who Khemia is - a man driven to explore, living on the edge of the unknown, determined to reach the ends of the Abyss, no matter what.

<<say $mc>>What kind of anime would you create?<</say>>
Her lips stretch into a wide grin as she begins to explain her ideas.

<<say $companionLily>>Well, let's see. It would be an epic adventure through various dimensions. Our protagonist would be a fearless traveler, a bit like us! But with a twist, they would have the power to morph into different creatures from each dimension they visit. Each episode would be a new world to explore, a new creature to master. It'll be action-packed, filled with vibrant colors and grand battles!<</say>>
Your mind spins with the visuals she paints, the concept is compelling indeed.

<<say $companionLily>>A role-playing game set in the Abyss! Each player can customize their own avatar and experience the changes just like we do.

:: Maru Smitten Ask

Maru's eyes sparkle with excitement, his usually round cheeks puffed up slightly, resembling a chipmunk. His fingers toy with the edge of his frilly dress as he anxiously paces back and forth in the dimly lit campsite, something obviously bothering him.

<<say $companionMaru>>Um... I have a request to ask... it's about a Relic we found<</say>>
He hesitates, looking down, twiddling with the hem of his dress with his nimble fingers.

His tone is apprehensive, his usual cheerful demeanor slightly replaced with uncertainty.

<<say $mc>>What's up, Maru? What's this about a Relic?<</say>>
You tilt your head, genuinely curious. He has been an irreplaceable companion on your journey, always providing a soothing presence despite the harsh and unpredictable nature of the Abyss.

Maru reaches into his bag, pulling out a white glove, almost like a single mitt. It's simple, yet somehow it holds a certain charm, drawing you in with an uncanny sense of warmth. This is the Smitten Mitt. The boy bites his lower lip, his eyes avoiding direct contact with yours, his actions hinting at a touch of embarrassment.

<<say $companionMaru>>Can I... can I use the Smitten Mitt? I think it can help me... you know, with the stress of the journey.<</say>>

Upon hearing your words, Maru's eyes light up like two twinkling stars. A radiant smile crosses his face, and he clutches the Mitt tighter to his chest, his anxiety replaced with a noticeable feeling of relief and joy.

<<say $companionMaru>>Thank you...thank you so much! This means a lot to me!<</say>>
Upon your approval, Maru nods eagerly, his face radiant with anticipation. He carefully slips his hand into the Smitten Mitt, a small sigh of contentment escaping his lips as he does so.

<<say $companionMaru>>It... it feels so real.<</say>>
He whispers in awe, his fingers gently curling around the phantom grip of the Mitt.

His usually vibrant eyes soften, a faraway look taking over as he closes them. The usual hyperactive Maru seems to melt away, replaced by a serene figure, his lips slightly parted in a small, peaceful smile.

<<say $companionMaru>>It's... it's like holding onto someone's hand... someone who's there for you.<</say>>
Maru's voice is soft, but his words echo around the campsite, bouncing off the silent Abyssal walls surrounding you.

Observing him, you realize the depth of the Smitten Mitt's effect. It's not just about the physical sensation, but also about the emotional assurance it provides. A sense of companionship, of not being alone, seems to radiate from Maru, warming the otherwise cold campsite.

Maru then opens his eyes, the blissful peace on his face replaced by his usual joviality. But there's a new-found confidence in his gaze, a sense of calm that wasn't there before. It's evident that the Smitten Mitt has done its magic, calming his nerves and alleviating the stress of the journey.

<<say $companionMaru>>I feel so much better! This is going to help a lot!<</say>>
He exclaims, waving his Mitt-clad hand around with a cheery giggle.

His lightheartedness brings a smile to your face. The Smitten Mitt had been a good call, and seeing Maru like this assures you that your journey through the Abyss will be a bit more bearable with the power of this Relic and the power of your bond.

:: Maru Smitten No

Despite his timidness, you consider his request. But you can't help but feel a tad worried. You've only got one Smitten Mitt, and it might be needed for an emergency situation.

<<say $mc>>I'm sorry, Maru, but we need to keep the Smitten Mitt in reserve. We don't know what we'll face further down in the Abyss.<</say>>
Maru's face drops, the excited spark in his eyes fading. His shoulders slump, and he clutches the Mitt tighter, almost protectively, a look of disappointment clearly etched on his features.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh... okay, I understand.<</say>>
He mutters quietly, his usual lively tone missing, replaced by a hint of sadness.

:: Lily Merrymaker Ask

A mischievous grin spreads across Lily's face, her eyes gleaming with enthusiasm as she twirls a lock of lavender hair around her finger. There's a particular sparkle to her expression, the one that usually precedes her craziest ideas. She pats the Heavenly Merrymaker in her hand, the unusual triangle cap gleaming under the muted light.

<<say $companionLily>>Hey, so I've been thinking... I mean, we've got this awesome Relic here. The Heavenly Merrymaker. Pretty rad, right?<</say>>
She spins the cap around her fingers with an expert flick, her gaze never leaving yours. It's clear she's building up to something, an anticipation filling the air between you.

<<say $mc>>It's an intriguing artifact, no doubt. But remember, we're in the Abyss for a purpose. It's not just about having fun.<</say>>
Lily rolls her eyes at you, her exuberant personality unaffected by your pragmatic words. She places the Heavenly Merrymaker on her head, the cap perched at a jaunty angle. A moment later, she removes it and sighs, a playful pout on her lips.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh, come on, don't be such a spoilsport! Just imagine the possibilities! We could have a blast with this thing. Anime marathons, exploring weird places, and I mean, come on... endless fun with zero consequences? It's like a dream come true!<</say>>
Lily's fervor is contagious, her enthusiasm radiating off her in palpable waves. Yet, there's also a sincerity in her eyes, a genuine yearning for the thrill and joy she's suggesting.

<<say $mc>>And how would that help us with our expedition? We need to stay focused, Lily.<</say>>
Her confident grin doesn't waver. Instead, she leans closer, her gaze determined.

<<say $companionLily>>Look, I get it. We're here for serious business, and I'm not suggesting we goof off all the time. But remember, the Abyss changes people, right? So what if this 'endless fun' could be a strategy? Maybe it'll keep us sane amidst all this craziness! Besides, wouldn't you want to have a moment of joy in a place like this?<</say>>
You find yourself considering Lily's words. The Abyss is indeed a strange and unsettling place, and perhaps this light-hearted approach could provide a semblance of normalcy. The mirthful gleam in Lily's eyes and her infectious enthusiasm make the idea all the more tempting.

:: Lily Merrymaker Yes

A moment of silence stretches between the two of you as you weigh Lily's proposal. She watches you, her eager anticipation hanging in the balance of your decision. After a moment, you sigh, a reluctant smile tugging at the corners of your mouth.

<<say $mc>>Alright, Lily. We'll give it a try. But remember, we can't lose sight of our mission.<</say>>
A victorious whoop echoes from Lily, her eyes sparkling brighter than ever before. She holds the Heavenly Merrymaker up, a trophy of her successful persuasion.

<<say $companionLily>>You won't regret this, promise! Now, let's see... where's that list of animes I wanted to marathon?<</say>>
Her excitement fills the atmosphere, bringing a rare moment of lightness and levity amidst the ever-changing, unfamiliar landscape of the Abyss. As she begins to plan your first 'timeless' escapade, you can't help but share in her anticipation. Perhaps this unconventional strategy might just work, or at least, provide some much-needed laughter along the way.

:: Lily Merrymaker No

Lily's enthusiasm hangs in the air, the silence stretching as you consider her proposition. Eventually, you sigh, shaking your head and looking at the Heavenly Merrymaker thoughtfully.

<<say $mc>>I understand what you're saying, Lily, but we have to stay focused. We can't afford to lose sight of our mission here.<</say>>
The vibrant energy surrounding Lily seems to deflate, her exuberance fading away into visible disappointment. She takes a step back, reluctantly setting the cap back into your hand.

<<say $companionLily>>I... I see. You're right. I was just... well, I guess I got carried away by the idea. I just thought it could... you know, make things a bit lighter. But you're right. We're here for a reason.<</say>>
Her voice trails off, her gaze averted from yours. It's rare to see her this subdued, her lively spirit dampened by your decision.

<<say $mc>>I know it's not what you wanted to hear, Lily. But we have to stay vigilant. The Abyss is unpredictable. We need to be prepared for anything.<</say>>
She nods at your words, her lips curling into a small, resigned smile. Despite her disappointment, she seems to respect your decision.

<<say $companionLily>>Yeah, you're right. We've got a job to do, after all. No point getting distracted by... well, distractions.<</say>>
She takes a deep breath, a spark of her usual optimism returning to her eyes. Even in disappointment, Lily's resilient spirit manages to shine through.

:: Maru Pangea Ask

The expedition's latest find, the Pangea Shaker, sits on the makeshift table between you and Maru, its shell catching the light and casting a prismatic glow in the dimly lit Abyss.

<<say $companionMaru>>Hey, um, do you think... maybe... I could use that? The Pangea Shaker, I mean...<</say>>
Maru blushes, nervously fiddling with the frills of his apron, eyes locked on the Relic.

<<say $mc>>The Pangea Shaker? You mean for your cooking?<</say>>
You're surprised, but it makes sense. With the wide variety of tastes within your expedition team, this Relic could be a cooking game-changer.

<<say $companionMaru>>Yes! Imagine, we could have any flavor we want, even in the middle of the Abyss! It's not like it's dangerous or anything, right? It could make our meals so much more... delightful!<</say>>
His enthusiasm is contagious, and you can see the joy sparking in his eyes. Cooking is a passion for Maru, and the Pangea Shaker could push his meals to new heights.

<<say $mc>>That's true, but what if we need it for something else?<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>>Oh, I promise to be really careful with it! And besides, isn't keeping our spirits high just as important? A tasty meal can do wonders for morale!<</say>>
Maru clasps his hands together, pleadingly looking at you with his big, round eyes.

<<say $mc>>Alright, but remember, it's a valuable artifact. If there's even a hint of trouble, we'll have to put it away, okay?<</say>>
You give in, unable to resist Maru's earnest expression.

<<say $companionMaru>>Yay! You won't regret this, I promise! Prepare yourself for the most delicious meals you've ever tasted!<</say>>
Maru beams, excitement written all over his face as he reverently takes the Pangea Shaker into his hands. It seems like the Abyss is about to experience a culinary revolution.

<<say $mc>>I understand Maru, but we can't risk it. We don't know the full extent of this Relic's abilities or if it has any side effects. It's too valuable to use for cooking.<</say>>
You're firm, believing in the caution that the unknown depths of the Abyss demand.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh, I... I see...<</say>>
Maru's eyes dim slightly, the rainbow glow of the Pangea Shaker flickering across his downcast face. His shoulders slump, hands slowly retracting from the relic.

<<say $mc>>I'm sorry, Maru. I know it's disappointing, but we have to be careful. The Abyss isn't a place for taking unnecessary risks.<</say>>
You try to offer him some comfort, but it's clear your decision weighs heavily on his spirit.

<<say $companionMaru>>No, no, it's okay... I understand. We're in the Abyss after all...<</say>>
Maru offers a weak smile, but it doesn't quite reach his eyes. His enthusiasm replaced by a sober understanding of the harsh environment you're all navigating.

:: Cherry Lambent Ask

Cherry's normally downcast eyes glint strangely in the half-light of the Abyss, her gaze fixed on the paper lantern held in your grasp. It is an unusual sight, this spark of life in the girl who seems to live in a constant state of melancholy.

<<say $companionCherry>>That's the Lambent Specter, isn't it?<</say>>
Her voice is low, nearly drowned out by the whispering shadows of the Abyss.

You merely nod, unsure of where this conversation is leading.

<<say $companionCherry>>Can I ask a favor? I... I want to use it... for my sister.<</say>>
She hesitates, her words barely escaping the thin line of her mouth.

This request, sudden and loaded with potential danger, has you fumbling for words.

<<say $mc>>You mean... bring her back?<</say>>
You try to keep your voice steady, though the implications of her request send waves of uncertainty crashing over you.

She nods again, her eyes never leaving the delicate artifact.

<<say $companionCherry>>I know it might not be the same... might not be really her. But... she's all I have, you know? And I feel like I owe her this... this chance to exist again.<</say>>
Cherry's voice cracks a little, the raw emotion behind her words standing in stark contrast to her usual flat demeanor.

The sight of her vulnerability stirs a complex blend of emotions within you, but you can't ignore the voice of reason that echoes within your thoughts.

<<say $mc>>Cherry... I understand, but what if it's not healthy for you? What if it's not really her but just an imitation?<</say>>
She seems to consider your words, her gaze now dropping to her hands, twisted together nervously in her lap.

<<say $companionCherry>>I've... thought about it. A lot. But even if it's just a fraction of her... I think it could help. Help me to move on. I need to say goodbye. Properly this time.<</say>>
You sit silently, struggling to weigh the potential consequences against Cherry's desperate plea. It isn't an easy decision, but then again, nothing about this expedition through the Abyss is.

:: Cherry Lambent No

Your heart wrenches in your chest, seeing Cherry in such a state. But you know that you have to choose the path that seems the most reasonable, the one that feels less likely to cause any further harm.

<<say $mc>>Cherry, I... I can't. I understand why you'd want this... but I don't think it's the right path. This... isn't healthy.<</say>>
For a moment, silence hangs heavy between you. You see the spark that had briefly ignited in Cherry's eyes flicker out. Her gaze falls away from the Lambent Specter, a quiet resignation returning to her features.

<<say $companionCherry>>I see... I suppose I had hoped... but it was a foolish hope.<</say>>
Her voice is soft, her words barely reaching your ears. She gives a slight nod, seemingly to herself more than you, a silent acknowledgment of your decision.

As she retreats into her usual solemn silence, you can tell that your refusal has affected her more deeply than her flat affect suggests. It is a blow that has further stoked the embers of her depression, a fact that makes your heart feel heavy with regret. But you have made your decision, one that you hope, in the long run, will prove to be the best for both of you.

[[End your conversation|Party overview][$convo.cherryLambent = 1]]


:: Cherry Lambent Yes

Finally, with a deep sigh, you turn the Lambent Specter over to Cherry, watching as her hands tremble slightly when she takes hold of it.

<<say $mc>>Alright, Cherry... but promise me, if it gets too much, if it's not what you expect, you'll stop.<</say>>
She nods, swallowing visibly. There is an uncharacteristic spark in her eyes, and you wonder if you have made the right decision. You watch as she cradles the lantern and closes her eyes, her lips moving in a silent plea.

A moment later, a flame sparks inside the lantern, flickering in an unseen breeze. But when a voice comes from it, it is a voice of a stranger, not her sister's. Cherry looks startled but quickly douses the flame with a vial of water she had prepared.

The process repeats itself, each time with a different voice, a different soul brought back from the unknown. With each attempt, Cherry's hope seems to fade a bit, replaced by a growing frustration and despair.

Watching her, you feel a twinge of regret. Seeing Cherry struggle in this way, cycling through souls in a desperate attempt to find her sister, you can't help but feel you have made the wrong choice. You consider stepping in, taking the lantern back, but a part of you is also telling you to let her keep trying. After all, isn't it her decision to make?

Caught in this internal debate, you finally decide to speak up.

<<say $mc>>Cherry...<</say>>
She doesn't seem to hear you, her focus solely on the lantern in her hands. Her determination is admirable, but also worrisome. Perhaps it is time for this experiment to end, for both Cherry's sake and for the sake of the souls accidentally called back. You prepare yourself for the tough conversation that is bound to follow.

[[Allow her to continue without interrupting|Cherry Lambent Continues]]
[[Step in and convince her to stop|Cherry Lambent Stops]]


:: Cherry Lambent Continues

You watch Cherry intently, her tireless efforts mirroring in the flickering light of the Lambent Specter. With each failed attempt, her resolve only seems to strengthen. She moves in an almost mechanical fashion, extinguishing one flame just to summon another, hope dwindling with every unfamiliar voice.

You sit silently, torn between your concern and your respect for Cherry's determination. The decision is hers, but the desperation in her eyes, the despair in her voice, it all weighs heavily on you.

Finally, after what feels like an eternity, she stops. Her hand, once steady despite the tremor of emotion, is shaking. The lantern's light flickers and dies out, and Cherry doesn't attempt to rekindle it. Exhausted, she sinks back against the Abyss's cool stone, her eyes empty.

<<say $companionCherry>>It's... it's not working.<</say>>
Her voice is a ghost of a whisper, as if the futile attempts have drained her of more than just physical energy.

You remain quiet, unable to find words that would comfort her. She isn't looking for empty platitudes or reassurances, you know. She has sought solace in the impossible, and the disappointment is all too tangible.

<<say $companionCherry>>I... I just thought... maybe...<</say>>
Her voice trails off, a sob catching in her throat. The lantern slips from her grasp, rolling to a stop at your feet. But she doesn't move to retrieve it. Doesn't move at all.

<<say $mc>>I'm... I'm sorry, Cherry.<</say>>
It's all you can offer. Any other words feel inadequate, an intrusion on her grief.

The conversation ends there, a sorrowful silence stretching out between the two of you, as vast and deep as the Abyss itself.

[[End your conversation|Party overview][$convo.cherryLambent = 1]]


:: Cherry Lambent Stops

<<say $mc>>Cherry... I think it's time to stop.<</say>>
You reach out gently to touch her shoulder, drawing her attention from the flickering lantern.

Her gaze lifts to meet yours, and you see the tears welling in her eyes. You pull the Lambent Specter from her grasp and place it gently aside.

<<say $mc>>I know you miss your sister, and it's natural to want to see her again. But this... This isn't healthy. It's time to let go and try to move on.<</say>>
Cherry looks at you, her eyes searching yours, as if seeking an answer that she can't find in the flickering flames of the Spectre.

<<say $companionCherry>>But... it was my fault...<</say>>
Her voice is so small, a whisper of guilt and pain that tugs at your heart.

<<say $mc>>No, Cherry, it wasn't. It's just life... and sometimes, life is unfair and unpredictable.<</say>>
You offer the words gently, as if trying to keep them from bruising her further.

For a moment, Cherry is silent, simply looking at you with wide, tear-filled eyes. Then, a ragged breath slips from her lips and she drops her gaze, her fingers absent-mindedly twisting the edge of her shirt.

<<say $companionCherry>>But I shouldn't have been there... maybe I could have...<</say>>
She begins, her voice barely above a whisper, filled with a haunting echo of regret.

<<say $mc>>Cherry, there's no way you could have known what would happen. And dwelling on what you could have done differently won't change the past.<</say>>
You are firm, but your voice holds an empathetic warmth, recognizing the weight of her guilt.

Her breath hitches, and for a moment, you think she might break down. But she takes a deep breath and nods, wiping at her eyes with a shaky hand. You watch as a spark of resilience flickers within her, breaking through the fog of her sadness.

<<say $mc>>You can honor your sister by living, Cherry. By moving forward, by not letting your life be defined by her loss.<</say>>
She seems to consider your words, her gaze flickering towards the now silent Lambent Specter. The moment is fragile, heavy with the pain of the past and the uncertainty of the future.

Feeling a surge of compassion, you move closer to Cherry, pulling her into a comforting embrace. Her body stiffens for a moment, before relaxing into your touch, her quiet sobs muffled against your shoulder.

<<say $companionCherry>>Maybe... Maybe you're right... Maybe it's time to move on.<</say>>
Her admission is hesitant, muffled into your shoulder, but it's a start. The smallest of smiles graces her lips as she pulls away from the hug, not one of happiness, but of acceptance. As you continue your expedition through the Abyss, you know that some changes are far more profound than those of the external world. And you hope Cherry's decision to move forward will lead her towards finding her inner peace.

:: Maru Firmament Sex Male

Maru, your delicate companion, catches your attention. His attire today leans towards the feminine, a knee-length skirt and a blouse that accentuates his soft, slender build. His outfit is as unusual as the Abyss itself, but it's his playfulness and charm that truly make him stand out. His large eyes sparkle with innocence, curiosity, and a touch of mischief. His short, tousled hair, always seeming to be in perfect disarray, matches his personality perfectly - whimsical, free-spirited, and radiantly youthful.

In this particular moment, it's not his cute feminine attire or his youthful charm that holds your attention.

<<say $companionMaru>>I want to paint you with the stars.<</say>>
Your heart thrums in your chest as Maru continues to spread the Firmament Pigment on you. The sensation is more intense when he dips his hand back into the bucket, scooping up more paint and tracing it onto your torso.

With a sense of wonder, you observe Maru's painted hands move to his own body, smearing the celestial pigment over his smooth skin. The twinkling stars reflecting off his slender frame make him seem ethereal.

Your breath hitches as Maru's hands again reach for you. This time, though, they trace a path lower. His fingers graze over your thighs, making you shudder, before they finally wrap around your arousal. The sensation is startling, the cool paint against your heated flesh contrasting and magnifying every small touch.

<<say $mc>>Maru...<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>>You're beautiful, like the night sky.<</say>>

Maru's hand glides along your length, the twinkling pigment enhancing the sensation. Your body thrums with a pleasure that is almost too much to bear. His hand works its magic, spreading the pigment around your cock, coating you in a pattern of twinkling stars.

<<say $mc>>Maru, I...<</say>>
Your words are cut off by your gasps. The Firmament Pigment is all over both of your bodies now, creating a glimmering, mesmerizing sight.

:: Saeko Giddy Ask

You stand in the heart of the Abyss, the dim glow from the surroundings dancing on your skin. Saeko is beside you, her eyes wide with fascination as she surveys the alien vegetation around you. There's a unique flora that catches her attention; the Viridian Twinkle, a plant with iridescent leaves and a steady pulse as if the plant had a heartbeat of its own.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Fascinating, isn't it? The Viridian Twinkle. Its unique physiology allows it to pulse, pushing nutrients from its roots to its leaves. It's like it has its own cardiovascular system, despite not having any apparent pumping organ like a heart.<</say>>
She's like a child in a candy shop, her excitement only rivaled by her scientific curiosity.

<<say $mc>>They're pretty cool, but what makes them so special?<</say>>
She turns to you, her face alight with the thrill of explaining her research. You can see the passion in her eyes as she begins to explain.

<<say $companionSaeko>>What makes them unique, you ask? Well, aside from their pulse-like circulatory mechanism, they also grow at an astonishing speed. This rapid regeneration is quite unusual, surpassing even fast growing surface plants like bamboo, and understanding how it works could revolutionize the way we think about plant life.<</say>>
Saeko shifts her gaze from the twinkling plant to the Giddy Reaper, nestled safely in your backpack.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I have a request. Would you mind if I use the Giddy Reaper on the Viridian Twinkle? It would allow me to study the rapid regeneration process in a more controlled environment. Don't worry, the plant will return to its previous height in just 12 hours, so if we make this our resting time for the day, we won't lose any time on our journey.<</say>>
She looks at you with pleading eyes as you consider your response.

The determined look on Saeko's face is met with your understanding nod. With a glimmer of gratitude in her eyes, she waits as you retrieve the Giddy Reaper from your backpack.

<<say $mc>>Alright, Saeko. You can use the Giddy Reaper. Just be careful with it.<</say>>
A look of relief spreads across her face. She handles the Relic with a kind of reverence, tracing the edge of the sickle carefully before turning her gaze back to the Viridian Twinkle.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I'll handle it with utmost care. Thank you for this.<</say>>
With a gentle hand, she begins her work. The Giddy Reaper slices through the plant in a clean, precise motion. You watch as the plant falls apart, but there's no feeling of loss or destruction. Instead, there's a strange anticipation in the air. As if you're about to witness something remarkable.

<<say $mc>>Now what?<</say>>
Saeko’s gaze is fixed on the now-severed Viridian Twinkle, her hand still clutching the Giddy Reaper.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Now, we wait. The Giddy Reaper's effects should cause the plant to grow back fully in 12 hours. I’ll document every phase of the regeneration. This could provide us with invaluable insights about Abyssal flora. Once again, thank you. This could make a significant difference in my research.<</say>>
Her gratitude feels genuine and heartfelt. You can't help but smile at her enthusiasm. You stand beside her, both of you observing the Abyss's unique phenomena in silent awe. Even in the face of the unknown, there's an unspoken bond of trust between you two, deepened by shared experiences and a mutual curiosity for the Abyss's enigmatic beauty.

:: Saeko Giddy No

A moment of silence follows her request as you ponder over it. The gravity of her request is not lost on you, and after a brief pause, you shake your head.

<<say $mc>>No, Saeko. The Giddy Reaper stays with me.<</say>>
She blinks, taken aback by your refusal. Her wide eyes stare at you in confusion, as if she can't quite comprehend the rejection. Her hand moves instinctively towards her glasses, adjusting them in a nervous gesture.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Oh. I see...<</say>>
Her voice is barely a whisper, disappointment lacing her every word. The vibrant gleam in her eyes dims slightly, akin to a star that's lost its shine. She stares at the Viridian Twinkle for a moment longer, the glow of the plant reflecting off her glasses.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I understand, it's a valuable Relic. I just thought... well, no matter. Thank you for considering it.<</say>>
She turns away from the plant, her shoulders slightly slumped. There's a hint of resentment in her eyes, but it's overwhelmed a lingering sadness. She quickly turns away to hide her expression from you, so you don;t get a chance to observe her much longer.

:: Saeko Tranquility Ask

Exhausted from the day's journey, you and Saeko find a quiet spot to unwind amidst the unearthly wilderness of the Abyss.

<<say $companionSaeko>>You must be as tired as I am, right? We've covered quite some distance today.<</say>>
You notice a certain gentleness laced in her typically academic tone, her usual stoic exterior momentarily softened. Her gaze then flickers to your pack where the Tranquility Knell is secured.

<<say $companionSaeko>>May I propose a suggestion? Could we use the Tranquility Knell? The quiet it produces... It's an ideal environment for studying the Abyss' flora. My research notes could use some additional insights.<</say>>
Her request hangs in the air, a mixture of her professional drive and a hint of vulnerability seeping through. It's clear that despite the alien surroundings, Saeko finds a deep comfort in her scientific pursuits. The Abyss may be changing you both, but some things, like her commitment to her work, remain a steady constant.

<<say $mc>>...<</say>>
You regard her, your response unformed, taking a moment to reflect on her request. A still silence falls between the two of you, the quiet hum of the Abyss seeming to hold its breath.

[[Allow her to use the Tranquility Knell|Saeko Tranquility Yes][$companionSaeko.affec+=(1+$hsswear)]]
[[Forbid her from using the Tranquility Knell|Saeko Tranquility No][$companionSaeko.affec-=(1+$hsswear)]]


:: Saeko Tranquility Yes

With your silent agreement, a small, appreciative smile plays on Saeko's lips. She reaches for the Tranquility Knell, the golden bell glowing faintly in her gentle grasp. You can see a spark of scholarly excitement glimmering in her eyes.

<<say $mc>>Sure, go ahead, Saeko. Maybe a little peace and quiet would do us good.<</say>>
The words are barely out of your mouth before she gives the bell a gentle shake. As the Tranquility Knell rings out, a veil of near-silence descends, the ambient noise of the Abyss receding to a whisper. It's an almost immediate shift, a sudden tranquility enveloping your shared space.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Thank you. I believe we will both benefit from this quiet. I will make sure to share any noteworthy findings with you.<</say>>
With the serenity provided by the Knell, Saeko turns her attention to the unique flora around. She pulls out her notes, pen moving swiftly across the pages as she records her observations. Even in this silence, you can almost make out her quiet hum of satisfaction.

<<say $mc>>Take your time, Saeko. We have this silence, and we have this moment.<</say>>
You settle down, watching Saeko immerse herself in her research with an uncontained enthusiasm. The quiet peacefulness fostered by the Tranquility Knell, and the shared companionship with Saeko in this ever-changing Abyss, offers a small yet comforting sense of stability.

:: Saeko Tranquility No

A hint of hesitation lingers on your features as you finally respond.

<<say $mc>>I'm sorry, Saeko, but I think we should save the Tranquility Knell. We don't know what we might face later on.<</say>>
The anticipation in Saeko's eyes dims, her gaze flicking back down to her notes with a small frown etching into her features. The disappointment is clear, yet she attempts to mask it with a nod of understanding.

<<say $companionSaeko>>You're right. We must prioritize our safety above all else.<</say>>
There's a certain stiffness to her tone, the academic shell reassembling itself around her. Despite her understanding, you could tell your decision has let her down. A silent agreement of sorts, as her focus once again becomes the Abyss and its mysteries, her disappointment quietly tucked away.

<<say $mc>>...<</say>>
Silently, you watch Saeko as she returns to her work, the ambient noise of the Abyss filling the silence. In this strange place decisions like these, necessary as they may be, seem to only make the journey a bit more challenging.

:: Cherry Smitten Ask

Cherry's sunken eyes seem to hold a world of resignation, the usual flatness of her tone replaced by a note of weariness you've become all too familiar with on this journey through the Abyss. Her hair falls limply over her face, hiding part of her expression from view.

<<say $companionCherry>>I've been thinking, do you think I could use the Smitten Mitt? Just... just for a little comfort, you know.<</say>>
The mention of the Smitten Mitt adds a peculiar kind of silence to the moment, its presence having the strange weight of unspoken stories, of hopeful desires. Her hands fumble with a bit of torn fabric, a small act of anxiety that seems at odds with her usual apathetic demeanor.

<<say $mc>>Is there a particular reason you want the Smitten Mitt?<</say>>
Her shoulders tense slightly, almost imperceptible under the fabric of her worn-out clothes. An oddity in the usually apathetic girl, this hint of vulnerability is unusual and concerning.

<<say $companionCherry>>I just... It's been a while since I felt anything... soft, or kind. And you said it feels like holding a hand, right? Like someone's there with you.<</say>>

[[Allow her to use the Smitten Mitt|Cherry Smitten Yes][$companionCherry.affec+=(1+$hsswear)]]
[[Forbid her from using the Smitten Mitt|Cherry Smitten No][$companionCherry.affec-=(1+$hsswear)]]


:: Cherry Smitten Yes

There's a stillness that stretches between you, a tension that lingers around the idea of the Smitten Mitt. Then, your affirmation finally breaks the silence.

<<say $mc>>Alright, Cherry. You can use the Smitten Mitt.<</say>>
The air shifts, the unspoken consent seems to lighten the tension. She reaches for the Smitten Mitt with a languid slowness. As her hand slides into the Relic, her eyes flicker closed momentarily, her face tilting up slightly, as if basking in the strange sensation. A soft sigh escapes her lips, a sound not of contentment, but of some small relief.

The Smitten Mitt, an object so innocuous yet strangely profound, works its magic. It gives her the sensation of holding a warm, comforting human hand. It's like an echo of a memory, a vague but tangible comfort amidst the unease of their expedition.

When Cherry's eyes open again, there's a small change in them. Still tired, still resigned, but with a hint of something else - a fleeting moment of peace, perhaps.

<<say $companionCherry>>It's strange. It doesn't feel real, but at the same time it does. It's like... like holding onto a ghost. An echo of something comforting. It doesn't change anything, but it... helps. Somehow.<</say>>
Her voice drifts off, words lost in the thoughts that continue to swirl inside her head. But for the moment, in the harsh and changing reality of the Abyss, the Smitten Mitt offers a small respite, a flicker of humanity amidst the unfathomable depths.

[[End your conversation|Party overview][$convo.cherrySmitten = 1]]


:: Cherry Smitten No

Cherry's request hangs in the air, a strange sensation of longing for a semblance of human connection. Her gaze is locked onto the worn-out fabric in her hands, as if it holds answers to questions she dares not ask.

<<say $mc>>Cherry, I understand why you might want to use the Smitten Mitt, but... it's not real. It won't provide you with genuine comfort and I don't think it would be good for you in the long term.<</say>>
You watch her closely, your words dropping like heavy stones into the silence that follows. Her eyelashes flutter, almost imperceptibly, as if shielding her from the reality of your words.

Her hands pause in their anxious fumbling and drop to her sides. Her head bows slightly as if accepting a harsh verdict. You notice a fine tremor running through her.

<<say $companionCherry>>Oh, I see... Yeah, I guess you're right. I just thought... never mind.<</say>>
Her voice is smaller, hollow, devoid of even the faintest inflection of hope she had earlier. A palpable wave of disappointment rolls off her, her normally dull eyes now tinged with a deep, almost indiscernible sadness. Her head bows lower, a gesture of surrender to the painful reality of your denial. The ever-present weight of the Abyss seems to press down on her more heavily, a despairing reminder of the isolation that pervades this strange place.

:: Lily Acrobatic Ask

You notice Lily begins to fidget with the strap of her backpack, her eyes sparkling with a glint of mischief. 

<<say $companionLily>>Hey, you know that Acrobatic Accord thingamajig we found earlier? I've been thinking...maybe I could, like, take it for a spin?<</say>>
Her fingers trace the air in a series of hypothetical loops and swirls, as if imagining the potential gravity-defying stunts she could pull off. She beams at you with unbridled enthusiasm, her energy infectious.

Her eyes remain fixed on you, shining with a mixture of excitement and curiosity, as she awaits your reaction. The normally chirpy Lily seems oddly silent, as she anxiously waits for your answer.

<<say $mc>>You mean you want to use the Acrobatic Accord? Just for fun?<</say>>
You raise an eyebrow, surprise coloring your tone. Though you're aware of Lily's love for adventure and excitement, the proposition is still somewhat unexpected. The Acrobatic Accord isn't a toy, after all. 

Lily's enthusiasm doesn't waver in the face of your skepticism. If anything, your words seem to fuel her excitement even further. She meets your gaze head on, her smile unwavering as she readies herself for the next part of her persuasion.

<<say $companionLily>>Well, why not? I mean, imagine the stunts I could pull off with it! You've got to admit, it would be pretty fun, right?<</say>>
[[Allow her to use the Acrobatic Accord|Lily Acrobatic Yes][$companionLily.affec+=(1+$hsswear)]]
[[Forbid her from using the Acrobatic Accord|Lily Acrobatic No][$companionLily.affec-=(1+$hsswear)]]


:: Lily Acrobatic Yes

The silence drags on for a bit, before your lips twitch into a smile. Lily's excitement is simply contagious, it's hard to not get swept up in it.

<<say $mc>>Alright, alright. You've convinced me. Let's see what you can do with that Acrobatic Accord.<</say>>
A victorious laugh escapes her as she pumps a fist in the air. The air around her seems to vibrate with her giddy anticipation.

<<say $companionLily>>Awesome! You won't regret this, promise!<</say>>
Without further ado, she slips the delicate anklet around her ankle, closing her eyes for a brief moment as she savors the unfamiliar sensation. Then, in the blink of an eye, she bursts into action.

Lily starts off simple, with a series of cartwheels that progress into handsprings, then fluidly transitions into walkovers. Her movements are so graceful, so fluid that they seem to blur the line between reality and some sort of magical dance.

She performs a succession of aerial flips, twisting and contorting her body mid-air with a level of finesse that defies logic. Each landing is as smooth as silk, not a single movement wasted or out of place. 

Then, she tries something even more daring: she scales a nearby tree like some sort of spider, her hands and feet moving with equal ease. She balances precariously on a slender branch, standing on one hand while her legs form a perfect split in the air. Her free hand waves to you, a cheeky grin adorning her face.

<<say $companionLily>>How's this for a show, eh?<</say>>
She then launches herself off the branch, twisting and turning in the air before nimbly landing on her feet. The finale is a series of rapid flips, with such speed and precision it almost seems like she's flying.

As she finally comes to a halt, panting and flushed, there's a spark of pure joy in her eyes that leaves you speechless. The sight of Lily, having pushed the limits of what seemed possible, fills you with a strange mixture of awe and respect.

[[End your conversation|Party overview][$convo.lilyAcrobatic = 1]]


:: Lily Acrobatic No

Seeing her excitement, you almost want to say yes, to indulge in the thrill she so eagerly seeks. But you understand the gravity of the situation better. The Abyss isn't a playground, and Relics like the Acrobatic Accord aren't toys.

<<say $mc>>Lily, it's not that simple. The Acrobatic Accord isn't something we should be messing around with for fun.<</say>>
Your words strike a chord, and Lily's grin fades. She looks at you, her bright eyes dimming slightly. Obvious disappointment mixes with annoyance on her face.

<<say $companionLily>>Aw, come on! Don't be such a buzzkill. We've been trudging around in this weird place, dealing with all sorts of freaky stuff. We should be having fun when we're exploring somewhere like this!<</say>>
Her disappointment is evident, the excitement in her eyes replaced by a touch of frustration. But she doesn't push it further, respecting your decision despite her obvious annoyance. There is a newfound tension in the air between you.

<<say $mc>>I understand, Lily. But it's not about fun. It's about being responsible and making sure we can handle the unexpected. This isn't a game.<</say>>
Lily's radiant eyes look back at you, her face morphing from a playful grin to a contemplative expression. She remains silent for a moment, weighing her words carefully before speaking up.

<<say $companionLily>>You're right, this isn't a game. It's life. And life is short, right? Too short to just worry about responsibilities and unexpected turns all the time. Isn't that why we're here? To explore, to experience new things?<</say>>
Her words echo in the silence, drawing a thoughtful look from you. Lily takes a deep breath, her eyes reflecting her sincerity.

<<say $companionLily>>Listen, I get it. The Abyss is dangerous and unpredictable. I know. But so is life. And if we just keep worrying about what might go wrong, we'll forget to enjoy what's going right. That's why I want to use the Acrobatic Accord. Not just because it's fun, but because that's the spirit of living, of finding joy in even the strangest and scariest of circumstances.<</say>>
Her words hang in the air, filled with an infectious optimism and a sense of adventure. Her expression is serious, but her eyes shine with an undeniable excitement. The air seems to buzz with energy as she looks at you, waiting for a response to her heartfelt declaration. 

<<say $mc>>That's... a way of looking at it, Lily. I'll... I'll think about it.<</say>>
Your words are met with a bright smile, the air of tension dissipating as her enthusiasm seeps back in. Even if she didn't get a yes, the promise of consideration is enough for her to regain her lively spirit.

<<say $companionLily>>Great! That's all I'm asking for. Now, shall we continue our adventure?<</say>>
As she bounds ahead, her energy is infectious, and despite the conflict, you can't help but appreciate her spirit.

:: Lily Silk One

As you and Lily take a breather from your expedition, she notices the Silk Twister in your inventory. Her eyes light up with excitement, a mischievous grin spreading across her face.

<<say $companionLily>>Ooh, is that the Silk Twister? I've heard about that thing! Can I try it out? Pretty please?<</say>>
Lily bounces on her toes, her pink hair swaying with the motion. Her enthusiasm is infectious, and you can't help but smile.

Before you get a chance to respond, Lily snatches the Silk Twister from your hands, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.

<<say $companionLily>>Watch this!<</say>>
Without hesitation, Lily runs the comb through her hair. In an instant, her pink locks grow to her waist, then twist into an elaborate updo worthy of a royal ball.

You watch in amazement as Lily continues to style her hair with lightning speed.

<<say $mc>>Wow, Lily! You're a natural with that thing.<</say>>
Lily beams at you, her hair now in a punk rock mohawk.

<<say $companionLily>>Right? This is amazing! It's like having a team of hairstylists at my fingertips. Ooh, I wonder...<</say>>
She runs the comb through her hair again, this time creating a cascade of intricate braids that seem to defy gravity.

<<say $companionLily>>You know, this could be super useful down here if you think about it. We could take this hair and weave it into a rope or something. And it's so easy to change up our appearance too! One minute I'm a prim and proper lady, the next I'm a wild rebel!<</say>>
Lily strikes a pose, her new hairstyle adding to her dramatic flair.

<<say $companionLily>>Plus, think of all the time we'd save getting ready in the morning. No more bad hair days in the Abyss!<</say>>
You can't help but laugh at Lily's enthusiasm.

:: Lily Silk Three

You reach out, a bit concerned about Lily's reckless enthusiasm.

<<say $mc>>Lily, maybe we should take it slow. We don't know all the properties of this Relic yet.<</say>>
Lily pouts, her newly styled hair softening back to its original length.

<<say $companionLily>>Aw, come on! Where's your sense of adventure? This is the Abyss, after all. Everything's a bit unpredictable here.<</say>>
She twirls the Silk Twister in her hand, her expression thoughtful.

<<say $mc>>I know, but we should be careful with artifacts we don't fully understand.<</say>>
Lily's pout transforms into a sly grin.

<<say $companionLily>>Alright, alright. But you gotta admit, it would be pretty handy. Imagine using it to create a rope in an emergency, or just to boost our confidence before a tough challenge.<</say>>
Her excitement is still evident, but she respects your caution.

<<say $companionLily>>Fine, we'll play it safe for now. But don't think I won't be dreaming up awesome hairstyles for our next break!<</say>>
With a playful wink, Lily hands the Silk Twister back to you. You tuck it safely away in your inventory

:: Saeko Star Compass One

You notice Saeko intently studying the Star Compass, her brow furrowed in concentration. She turns it over in her hands, occasionally jotting down notes in her red journal.

<<say $companionSaeko>>This Star Compass is absolutely fascinating. The way it consistently points downward, regardless of orientation, defies conventional magnetic principles. I have a theory about its mechanism.<</say>>
Saeko's eyes light up with excitement as she launches into her explanation.

<<say $mc>>Oh? What's your theory?<</say>>
She adjusts her red glasses, a gleam of intellectual curiosity in her eyes.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I believe it's responding to the concentration gradient of the Abyss's miasma. The deeper we go, the denser the corrupting influence becomes. This compass might be attuned to that somehow!<</say>>

You lean in, genuinely intrigued by Saeko's hypothesis.

<<say $mc>>That's an interesting idea. How could we use this to our advantage?<</say>>
Saeko's face lights up at your interest, and she begins to pace excitedly.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Oh, the possibilities are endless! We could use it to map the miasma density throughout the Abyss, potentially identifying safer routes or areas of particular danger. It might even help us locate unique flora that thrive in specific miasma concentrations!<</say>>
Saeko smiles as she continues explaining how that could be used, and you find yourself caught up in her enthusiasm for her ideas.

[[End your conversation|Party overview][$convo.SaekoStarCompass=true]]


:: Saeko Star Compass Three

You furrow your brow, considering Saeko's words carefully.

<<say $mc>>But if it's responding to the miasma, shouldn't it react to local concentrations too? We've seen pockets of denser miasma that don't affect it.<</say>>
Saeko's expression falters for a moment, but she quickly recovers, her scientific mind whirring.

<<say $companionSaeko>>That's a good point. Perhaps it's calibrated to respond only to large-scale gradients, filtering out local fluctuations. Or maybe...<</say>>
She trails off for a few seconds, lost in thought. After a moment, she snaps her fingers.

<<say $companionSaeko>>What if it's not just the miasma, but some other combination of factors unique to the Abyss's structure? There are all sorts of anomalies in the Abyss that could play a role.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>That sounds even more complicated. How would we even begin to test that?<</say>>
Saeko grins, the challenge clearly invigorating her.

<<say $companionSaeko>>That's the beauty of it! We'd need to design a series of experiments, carefully isolating variables. Though, it's a bit tricky given that we don't even know what properties it might be responding to, let alone how to measure those anomalies.<</say>>
She seems to pause and consider it, as if thinking through whether there's any way for her to figure out how the Star Compass really works during your expedition.

Despite your initial skepticism, you can't help but admire Saeko's passion and scientific rigor.

:: Khemia World Stone One

The camp is quiet as you settle down for the evening. Khemia approaches, his blue hair tousled from a long day of exploring. His red cape billows slightly in the gentle breeze as he sits beside you, a glint of excitement in his eyes.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Hey there, I've been thinking about that World Stone we picked up earlier. Mind if I take a closer look?<</say>>
You hand Khemia the small barbell, watching as he turns it over in his calloused hands.

<<say $mc>>What's on your mind, Khemia?<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, you know me. Always looking for ways to push the limits. This little beauty might be just what I need to give me an edge in reaching the bottom of the Abyss.<</say>>
Khemia stands, testing the weight of the World Stone with a few bicep curls. His muscles flex impressively under his shirt.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Imagine the possibilities! With this, I could train harder, recover faster, and maybe even surpass what we thought was humanly possible. What do you think? Should I give it a shot?<</say>>

You nod enthusiastically, caught up in Khemia's excitement. He grins widely, his adventurous spirit infectious.

<<say $mc>>Go for it, Khemia! If anyone can make the most of this Relic, it's you.<</say>>
Khemia's eyes light up, and he immediately drops to the ground, starting a set of push-ups with the World Stone balanced on his back.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Ha! I knew you'd understand. Just watch, partner. I'll be scaling those Abyss walls like a mountain goat in no time!<</say>>
As Khemia exercises, you notice the stone subtly changing, adapting to his strength. His movements become more powerful with each repetition.

<<say $companionKhemia>>You know, this isn't just about building raw muscle and strength. For me, it's about pushing boundaries, finding out what we're truly capable of. The Abyss has so many secrets, and with things like this... well, who knows what we might discover?<</say>>
Khemia jumps to his feet, barely winded despite the intense workout. He tosses the World Stone from hand to hand, a thoughtful expression on his face.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Thanks for backing me on this. It means a lot to have an expedition leader who understands the thrill of the unknown. Now, how about we plan our next move? With this edge, I'm feeling ready to tackle whatever the Abyss throws at us!<</say>>

:: Khemia World Stone Three

You furrow your brow, considering the implications of relying on a Relic for physical enhancement.

<<say $mc>>I don't know, Khemia. Isn't part of the challenge doing it on your own? Maybe we should be careful about using magical shortcuts.<</say>>
Khemia pauses, the World Stone held loosely in his hand. He looks at you with a mix of disappointment and respect.

<<say $companionKhemia>>I see your point. It's true, the thrill of the adventure comes from overcoming obstacles with our own strength and wit.<</say>>
He sets the World Stone down and leans against a nearby rock, his expression thoughtful.

<<say $mc>>Don't get me wrong, I know how much reaching the bottom means to you. I just worry about the risks.<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>No, you're right to be cautious. The Abyss is unpredictable enough without throwing magical enhancement into the mix. But you've got to admit, it's tempting.<</say>>

Khemia runs a hand through his blue hair, a wry smile playing on his lips.

<<say $companionKhemia>>I'll hold off for now, but if I start feeling that my current limits aren't enough, you've got to let me try, you know? It's a lot riskier to lose a fight to a tentacle beast than it is to rely on a Relic.<</say>>

:: Cloud Heart-stealing Stole One

As you're setting up camp for the night, you notice Cloud eyeing the Heart-stealing Stole with a mischievous glint in his green eyes. He saunters over, his swashbuckler-style outfit swaying with each step.

<<say $companionCloud>>Well, well, what do we have here? That stole's been calling my name all day. How about letting me take it for a spin?<</say>>
Cloud runs a hand through his tousled brown hair, a charming smile playing on his lips.

<<say $mc>>Sure, I don't see why not. Just be careful with it.<</say>>
You hand over the stole, watching as Cloud drapes it around his neck with a flourish.

<<say $companionCloud>>Ooh, now this is something else. I can practically feel the charm oozing out of me. You know, with this little accessory, I bet I could talk my way into—or out of—just about anything.<</say>>

<<say $mc>>Just don't let it go to your head, smooth talker. We don't need you stirring up more trouble than usual.<</say>>
Cloud chuckles, the stole dramatically billowing around him despite the still air.

<<say $companionCloud>>Trouble? Me? Never. But imagine the possibilities! We could charm our way past any obstacle in the Abyss that's willing to listen. No more fighting, just smooth talking. Though admittedly, there aren't many threats down here that will listen, rather than attacking on sight.<</say>>
He strikes a pose, looking every bit the dashing rogue.

<<say $companionCloud>>But you've got a point. It'd be a shame to let this do all the heavy lifting. Where's the thrill in that? Half the fun is in the challenge, right?<</say>>
Cloud unwraps the stole and hands it back to you with a wink.

<<say $companionCloud>>Besides, I like to think I've got enough natural charisma to get by. But it's nice to know we've got an ace up our sleeve if things do get dicey.<</say>>
You tuck the stole away, noticing how Cloud's eyes linger on it for a moment before he turns back to help with the camp.

A thoughtful expression crosses your face as you consider Cloud's dreams.

Cloud's eyes light up, a mix of excitement and contemplation in his gaze.

<<say $companionCloud>>Now you're speaking my language. Using a little extra charm to unite instead of divide... It could be just the ticket to get people to open their eyes and see past their own backyards.<</say>>
He paces, the stole flowing behind him like a cape.

<<say $mc>>Just be careful. Messing with people's feelings is no small thing.<</say>>
Cloud seems as if he's going to brush off your concern for a moment with a bit of bravado, but then he nods.

<<say $companionCloud>>You're right, of course. It's a fine line between persuasion and manipulation. But imagine if we could use this to get world leaders to actually talk to each other, to see the humanity in their so-called enemies.<</say>>
He removes the stole, holding it thoughtfully.

<<say $companionCloud>>This little piece of fabric could help contribute to something big.<</say>>
Cloud carefully folds the stole and hands it back to you, a new determination in his eyes. His gaze seems to linger on the stole as you put it back, before he goes back to helping with the camp.

:: Khemia Orbweaver One

As you and Khemia take a breather from your latest descent, you notice him eyeing the Orbweaver in your pack with keen interest. His blue hair is tousled from the journey, and his red cape is slightly dusty, but his eyes sparkle with excitement.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Hey, $mc.name. That Orbweaver we picked up earlier - mind if I take a closer look?<</say>>

You hand over the spider-shaped device, watching as Khemia turns it over in his calloused hands, a grin spreading across his face.

<<say $mc>>What's got you so interested, Khemia?<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, I think this little beauty could be pretty useful for us as we explore the Abyss. Imagine creating instant bridges across chasms, or sealing off dangerous passages in seconds!<</say>>

He gives the Orbweaver a gentle squeeze, watching as a glob of sticky substance oozes out and plops onto the chasm floor.

<<say $companionKhemia>>You know, I once got cornered by a whole pack of Baying Gourmets on an expedition. If I'd had this then, I could've created a quick barricade. And they'd be able to get around it, sure, but a few seconds to think of a plan can make all the difference in a situation like that. What do you say we give this thing a test run?<</say>>

[[Sure, let's try it out|Khemia Orbweaver Two][$companionKhemia.affec+=(1+$hsswear)]]
[[Maybe we should save it for emergencies|Khemia Orbweaver Three][$companionKhemia.affec-=(1+$hsswear)]]


:: Khemia Orbweaver Two

Your agreement lights up Khemia's face. He immediately starts scanning the cavern for a suitable test area.

<<say $mc>>What did you have in mind?<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Watch this!<</say>>
With a fluid motion, Khemia leaps onto a nearby boulder. He squeezes the Orbweaver, aiming at a narrow gap between two rock formations. The sticky substance shoots out, quickly bridging the gap.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Give it a few seconds to harden, and... voila!<</say>>
True to his word, the substance solidifies into a sturdy bridge. Khemia confidently strides across it, his cape billowing behind him.

<<say $companionKhemia>>See? Instant pathways wherever we need them. With this, I don't think we'll need to waste time with a rope anymore at all.<</say>>
His enthusiasm is contagious, and you find yourself smiling along with him.

<<say $companionKhemia>>What do you think? Ready to push the limits of what's possible and dive as deep as we can?<</say>>
Khemia's eyes gleam with the thrill of adventure, reminding you why he's considered the most experienced Abyss explorer alive.

:: Khemia Orbweaver Three

Khemia's smile dims slightly, but he nods in understanding.

<<say $mc>>We don't know how much substance it contains. It might be best to save it for when we really need it.<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Fair point. Caution has its place, even in the Abyss. Though I must say, in all my expeditions, I've found that sometimes taking calculated risks can lead to the greatest discoveries.<</say>>
He hands the Orbweaver back to you, a thoughtful expression on his face.

<<say $mc>>You sound like you have a story there.<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Oh, I've got plenty! There was this one time, deep in the Third Layer, when I came across a peculiar crystalline formation. Most would've passed it by, but I decided to look a little closer...<</say>>

Khemia launches into a tale of heroics that sounds like it may be slightly embellished even though it's likely based in fact, his animated gestures bringing the story to life.

<<say $companionKhemia>>...and that's how I found a hidden cache of Relics that made that expedition a pretty penny. Sometimes, a little risk can unveil wonders beyond imagination. Though they did decide that was enough for them and turned back afterwards, even though I thought some of those Relics would be useful deeper down.<</say>>

He sighs wistfully at what could have been, then gives you a wink, his earlier disappointment seemingly forgotten in the joy of sharing his experience.

<<say $companionKhemia>>But you're right, we should be prepared for anything. When the time comes to use that Orbweaver, I'll be ready with a plan!<</say>>

:: Cherry Soulseeker One

The dim light of the miasma flickers across Cherry's tired face as she eyes the Soulseeker rods in your hands. Her usual apathy seems momentarily replaced by a mix of curiosity and apprehension.

<<say $companionCherry>>Those rods... They're supposed to show what you want most, right? I don't know if I want to use them.<</say>>
Cherry shifts uncomfortably, pulling her hoodie tighter around herself.

<<say $mc>>Maybe it could help you find some direction, Cherry. Do you want to know what truly drives you?<</say>>
Cherry's eyes dart between you and the rods, a flicker of something — fear, perhaps — crossing her face.

<<say $companionCherry>>What if... what if they lead me somewhere I don't want to go? Or worse, what if they lead me to nothing?<</say>>

You gently place the Soulseeker rods in Cherry's hands. She grips them tightly, her knuckles turning white.

<<say $mc>>Sometimes, facing our fears is the first step towards overcoming them. I'll be right here with you.<</say>>
Cherry nods slowly, her eyes fixed on the rods. As she holds them out, they begin to vibrate softly.

<<say $companionCherry>>They're... they're pulling me. They're pointing upward, towards the surface.<</say>>
She closes her eyes, her brow furrowing in concentration.

<<say $companionCherry>>It feels like they're guiding me towards warmth. Like... like sunlight. I haven't really felt that in so long. When I did, well, it didn't really feel like anything...<</say>>
A tear rolls down Cherry's cheek, but for the first time since you've known her, you see the ghost of a smile on her lips.

<<say $companionCherry>>I think... I think what I want most is to feel alive again. To feel anything at all.<</say>>
Cherry opens her eyes, looking at you with a newfound spark of determination.

<<say $companionCherry>>Thank you for pushing me to try this. Maybe... maybe there is something worth fighting for after all.<</say>>
As Cherry hands the rods back to you, you notice her shoulders seem a little less slumped, her eyes a little brighter.

:: Cherry Soulseeker Three

You nod understandingly, pocketing the Soulseeker rods.

<<say $mc>>It's okay, Cherry. We don't have to use them if you're not comfortable.<</say>>
Cherry's posture relaxes slightly, but her eyes remain fixed on your pocket where the rods disappeared.

<<say $companionCherry>>I've spent so long not to feeling anything. The idea of confronting what I truly want... it's too much.<</say>>
She sighs, running a hand through her bright red hair.

<<say $mc>>Sometimes, not knowing can be its own form of protection. But remember, whenever you're ready to face it, I'll be here to support you.<</say>>
Cherry nods, a flicker of gratitude in her eyes.

<<say $companionCherry>>Maybe someday. For now, just knowing that option exists... it's both scary and oddly comforting.<</say>>
She pulls her hoodie tighter.

<<say $companionCherry>>Thanks for understanding. It means a lot.<</say>>
As you continue your journey, you can't help but wonder what the Soulseeker might have revealed, and if Cherry will ever be ready to find out.

:: Cherry Devil's Own One

Cherry sits on the edge of your camp her bright red hair contrasting sharply with the dull gray-green of her hoodie. She absently turns the Devil's Own charm over in her hands, her expression as flat and tired as ever.

<<say $companionCherry>>So... this thing's supposed to make us lucky, huh? Sounds too good to be true.<</say>>
She looks up at you, a hint of skepticism in her otherwise expressionless eyes.

<<say $mc>>That's what they say. Want to give it a try?<</say>>
Cherry shrugs, her shoulders barely moving under the weight of her perpetual exhaustion.

<<say $companionCherry>>I guess. Not like my luck could get any worse, right? Though knowing me, it probably will.<</say>>

You nod encouragingly, and Cherry sighs before clasping the charm tightly in her fist.

<<say $mc>>Come on, Cherry. Let's see what this thing can do.<</say>>
For a moment, nothing happens. Then, a small smile tugs at the corner of Cherry's mouth – the first you've seen in ages.

<<say $companionCherry>>I... I feel different. Like the weight on my shoulders is a little lighter.<</say>>
As if on cue, a beam of light breaks through the clouds above, illuminating Cherry's face.

<<say $companionCherry>>Huh. That's... kind of nice, actually.<</say>>
You watch as Cherry's posture straightens ever so slightly, a spark of life returning to her eyes.

<<say $companionCherry>>Maybe there's something to this luck thing after all. Who knows? We might even make it out of this Abyss in one piece.<</say>>
The hint of hope in her voice is unmistakable, coontrasting with her usual pessimism.

Cherry's shoulders slump even further as she pockets the charm.

<<say $mc>>Maybe we should wait for a more crucial moment to use it. We don't want to waste its power.<</say>>
Cherry lets out a bitter chuckle, shaking her head.

<<say $companionCherry>>Right. Because that's how my luck works. Saving the good stuff for later always pays off, doesn't it?<</say>>
She stands up, brushing off her hoodie with a weary motion.

<<say $mc>>Cherry, I didn't mean-<</say>>
She cuts you off with a wave of her hand. and tosses the charm back to you.

<<say $companionCherry>>It's fine. Really. I'm used to it. Let's just... keep moving. The Abyss isn't going to explore itself, and neither is my perpetual bad luck.<</say>>
As you continue on, you can't help but notice the way Cherry's hand keeps drifting to her pocket, where she used to hold the charm.

:: Cloud Creator's Bolt One

You're resting at camp when Cloud approaches, a glint of excitement in his green eyes. He's holding the Creator's Bolt, turning it over in his hands with a thoughtful expression.

<<say $companionCloud>>Hey, I've been thinking about this arrow we found. Have you considered the possibilities it opens up?<</say>>
Cloud is smiling gently as he speaks to you, casually twirling the Relic between his fingers.

<<say $mc>>What do you have in mind?<</say>>
A mischievous smile plays across Cloud's face as he straightens up.

<<say $companionCloud>>Imagine creating the perfect educational materials. We could teach people about unity, equality, and peace in ways they'd actually enjoy. It's like... planting seeds of change in their minds, you know?<</say>>
He pauses, gauging your reaction.

:: Cloud Creator's Bolt Two

You lean forward, intrigued by Cloud's enthusiasm.

<<say $mc>>That sounds interesting. What kind of educational materials did you have in mind?<</say>>
Cloud's eyes light up, and he begins pacing excitedly.

<<say $companionCloud>>Picture this: interactive stories where people from different backgrounds work together to solve problems. Or games that simulate building a society without borders. We could even create documentaries showcasing the benefits of a unified world!<</say>>
He pauses, running a hand through his brown hair.

<<say $companionCloud>>And the best part? We can tailor it to each person's interests. History buffs, sci-fi fans, whatever they're into – we make learning engaging for everyone.<</say>>
Cloud's passion is palpable as he continues brainstorming ideas.

<<say $companionCloud>>What do you think? Want to give it a shot? We could start small, maybe create something for the next village we visit.<</say>>
You consider the potential of Cloud's idea, weighing the possibilities and risks.

<<say $mc>>Alright, Cloud. Let's try it out in the next village. But we'll need to be careful about how we present these ideas.<</say>>
Cloud's face breaks into a wide grin, his eyes sparkling with excitement.

<<say $companionCloud>>Absolutely! We'll start small and see how people respond. This could be the beginning of something incredible. Thanks for giving it a chance.<</say>>
With a newfound sense of purpose, Cloud tucks the Creator's Bolt safely away, already deep in thought about the educational content you'll create together.

[[End your conversation|Party overview][$convo.cloudCreatorsBolt=true]]

You frown slightly, considering the implications of Cloud's suggestion.

<<say $mc>>I'm not sure, Cloud. Creating media to influence people's thoughts... isn't that a form of manipulation?<</say>>
Cloud's expression grows serious, and he lowers the Creator's Bolt.

<<say $companionCloud>>I understand your concern. But think about it – isn't all education a form of influence? The difference is in the intent.<</say>>
He begins to pace, gesturing passionately as he speaks.

<<say $companionCloud>>We're not talking about brainwashing here. It's about presenting ideas, sparking discussions. People would still make their own choices. We'd just be... opening their eyes to possibilities they might not have considered before.<</say>>
Cloud stops and turns to face you, his green eyes intense.

<<say $mc>>But where do we draw the line? How can we ensure we're not crossing ethical boundaries?<</say>>
He nods, acknowledging your point.

<<say $companionCloud>>That's a fair question. Maybe we start small – focus on basic concepts like empathy and cooperation. Nothing controversial. We could even ask for feedback, make sure we're not overstepping.<</say>>
Cloud's voice softens, revealing a hint of vulnerability.

<<say $companionCloud>>I just want to make a difference, you know? To create a world where no one suffers like I did. But you're right – we need to be careful about how we go about it.<</say>>

:: Saeko Flamel's Folly One

You find Saeko intently looking over the Flamel's Folly, her red glasses slightly askew as she peers at the rod. Her black hair is tied back in a messy bun, and her gray coat is draped over a nearby rock. She looks up as you approach, her eyes gleaming with excitement.

<<say $companionSaeko>>This Relic is absolutely fascinating! The implications for material science are staggering. Have you considered the potential applications?<</say>>
Saeko stands up, gesturing animatedly with the rod.

<<say $mc>>I hadn't given it much thought. What did you have in mind?<</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>Oh, where to begin! We could use it to analyze the unique properties of Abyss materials. Imagine transmuting a small portion of an unknown substance and observing the resulting reactions. It could lead to the discovery of entirely new elements!<</say>>
Saeko's enthusiasm is infectious, and you find yourself drawn into her scientific fervor.

You lean in, genuinely intrigued by Saeko's ideas.

<<say $mc>>What kind of experiments did you have in mind?<</say>>
Saeko's eyes light up behind her glasses, and she begins pacing excitedly.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Well, first, we could start with some of the unique flora we've encountered. By transmuting small portions of their cellular structure, we might uncover how they've adapted to the Abyss's environment. And then there's the mineral compositions! We could potentially create new alloys or compounds never before seen on the surface.<</say>>
She pauses, a hint of vulnerability crossing her features.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I know I can get carried away with the academic side of things, but... can you imagine the breakthroughs we could make? This could change our understanding of the very fabric of reality.<</say>>
Saeko takes a deep breath, composing herself.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Of course, we'd need to be incredibly cautious. Perhaps we should wait until we have a more controlled environment. Safety first, right?<</say>>
You nod, impressed by both her enthusiasm and her restraint.

<<say $mc>>Your passion is admirable, Saeko. When we get back, I'm sure you'll be able to conduct those experiments safely.<</say>>
Saeko smiles, a mix of gratitude and determination in her expression.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Thank you. It means a lot to have your support. For now, let's focus on our expedition. But mark my words, we're on the cusp of something revolutionary.<</say>>

<<say $mc>>Saeko, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but shouldn't we be worried about the potential dangers?<</say>>
Saeko's excitement dims a bit, but she nods thoughtfully.

<<say $companionSaeko>>You're right, of course. The Abyss is unpredictable enough without introducing elemental transmutation into the mix.<</say>>
She looks down at Flamel's Folly, her expression a mix of longing and resignation.

<<say $companionSaeko>>It's just... the potential for discovery is so tantalizing. But you're absolutely correct. We can't risk destabilizing our environment or endangering the team.<</say>>
Saeko carefully places the rod back in your pack, her movements deliberate and almost reluctant.

<<say $mc>>I'm sorry, Saeko. I know how much this means to you.<</say>>
She shakes her head, offering you a small smile.

<<say $companionSaeko>>No, don't apologize. Your caution is commendable. It's easy to get lost in the pursuit of knowledge and forget the practical concerns. This is why we make a good team, you know?<</say>>
Saeko straightens her glasses and smooths down her coat.

<<say $companionSaeko>>When we return to the surface, perhaps we can design some controlled experiments. For now, let's focus on documenting what we find naturally. The Abyss still has plenty of secrets to reveal, even without elemental manipulation.<</say>>
You nod, relieved by her understanding and impressed by her adaptability.

<<say $mc>>Agreed. And who knows? Maybe what we discover on this expedition will inform how we use Flamel's Folly in the future.<</say>>

The soft glow of the miasma illuminates your campsite as Maru fidgets with the hem of his pastel blue dress. His eyes keep darting to the Luminous Phantasmagoria in your pack, a mix of curiosity and longing in his gaze.

<<say $companionMaru>>Um... hey. That halo thingy we found earlier... do you think I could try it on? Just for a little bit?<</say>>
You notice a slight tremor in Maru's voice, his usual shyness amplified by the request.

<<say $mc>>Of course, Maru. Here, let me help you put it on.<</say>>
As you place the halo above Maru's head, it hovers gracefully, casting a soft, ethereal light that complements his blue hair.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh! It feels... warm. And kinda tingly. How do I look?<</say>>
Maru twirls slowly, his dress swirling around him. The halo seems to enhance his natural charm, making him appear even more delicate and innocent than usual.

A blush creeps across Maru's cheeks, and he fiddles with a strand of his blue hair.

<<say $companionMaru>>You really think so? I mean, I know I'm different, but sometimes it's hard to feel... accepted.<</say>>
You step closer, gently adjusting the halo above Maru's head.

<<say $companionMaru>>But you're right. This Relic, it's like a shield against judgment. Maybe... maybe I don't need it after all.<</say>>
Maru's eyes light up with a newfound determination, matching the glow of the halo. He carefully removes it and hands it back to you.

<<say $companionMaru>>Thank you. Not for the halo, but for... well, believing in me. I think I can face the surface world just as I am.<</say>>
As Maru smiles, you notice a change in his posture – a little straighter, a little more assured. Your words seem to have unlocked something within him, a spark of self-assurance that was always there, waiting to shine.

You notice the hint of disappointment in his voice and quickly add:

He straightens his dress, a look of determination crossing his features.

<<say $companionMaru>>I've always been a bit scared of how people might react to me up there. But with this... maybe I can be the one to show them that being different is okay.<</say>>
You watch as Maru's demeanor shifts, it's a side of him you haven't seen before – still gentle, but with an underlying bit of courage.

As you trudge through the fiery tentacle field, Saeko pulls up beside you, her face flushed from the intense heat. She pushes her red glasses up her nose, leaving a smudge of soot.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Have you noticed the fascinating interplay between the flora and the combustion processes here? It's utterly unprecedented.<</say>>
She gestures excitedly at the burning landscape around you, seemingly oblivious to the danger.

<<say $mc>>I'm a bit more concerned with not getting burned alive, Saeko.<</say>>
You bat away a tendril that's creeping too close to your face.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Oh, of course. But isn't it remarkable? These tentacles seem to be flame-retardant to some degree. And look at those colored fires! I hypothesize they're feeding on different chemical compounds in the tentacle flesh.<</say>>

<<say $mc>>What do you think causes the different colors?<</say>>
Saeko's face lights up, rivaling the flames around you.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Excellent question! The purple hue likely indicates the presence of potassium salts, while the green might suggest copper compounds. It's like a natural fireworks display, but infinitely more dangerous.<</say>>
She pulls out a small notebook, jotting down observations with a stubby pencil.

<<say $companionSaeko>>This layer is a goldmine of data. The implications for our understanding of the elemental makeup of the Abyss are staggering.<</say>>
Saeko pauses, a hint of vulnerability crossing her features.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I... I do hope we make it back to publish these findings. It would be a shame if all this knowledge was lost.<</say>>

<<say $companionSaeko>>You're right, of course. I apologize. It's just... we're the first to see this and potentially live to tell about it. It's hard not to get caught up in the discovery.<</say>>
Saeko's shoulders slump slightly, her excitement dampened.

<<say $mc>>I get it, but we need to survive to share what we've found. Others might have seen this, but they never made it back.<</say>>

Maru's eyes light up, a slight smile playing on his lips despite the oppressive heat and acrid smoke.

<<say $companionMaru>>Well, it's horrible, yes... but it's also beautiful in a way. Look at those purple flames! And the way the tentacles move... it's almost hypnotic. Plus, we're making history! No one has ever seen this before.<</say>>
He gestures around, his earlier fear seemingly diminished in his enthusiasm.

<<say $companionMaru>>I've always wanted to push the boundaries of what we know about the Abyss. This layer... it's full of of chaos and rebirth. Everything burning and regrowing constantly. It's terrifying, but also... kind of inspiring?<</say>>
Maru blushes slightly, realizing how carried away he's gotten.

<<say $companionMaru>>Sorry, I know that probably sounds weird. I just can't help but be amazed, even if I'm scared at the same time.<</say>>

He shivers despite the intense heat, pulling his singed dress tighter around himself.

<<say $mc>>We're explorers, Maru. We're here to uncover the Abyss's secrets. Your fear is what keeps us cautious and alive.<</say>>
Maru nods slowly, a look of determination replacing his fear.

<<say $companionCloud>>But imagine if we could harness this technology, this efficiency, and combine it with real human compassion. We could build a world where no one goes hungry, where love knows no boundaries, all without losing our humanity in the process.<</say>>
Cloud's voice drops to a whisper.

<<say $companionCloud>>This layer of the Abyss... it's a glimpse of what's possible, both the good and the bad. And I intend to learn everything I can from it.<</say>>
He turns to you with a wink, his familiar playful demeanor returning.

<<say $companionCloud>>But first, we should probably get away from those drones. I don't fancy paying getting tied to a robot overlord, do you?<</say>>

:: Cloud Layer7 Three

You shift nervously, eyeing the patrolling robots in the distance.

<<say $mc>>Maybe we should get out of here before those machines spot us. This place gives me the creeps.<</say>>
Cloud raises an eyebrow, a hint of disappointment flashing across his face before he masks it with a smirk.

<<say $companionCloud>>Aww, where's your sense of adventure? We've stumbled upon a goldmine of knowledge and technology, and you want to turn tail and run?<</say>>
He steps away from the railing, his voice taking on a more serious tone.

<<say $mc>>I just think it's dangerous. We don't know what those robots are capable of.<</say>>
Cloud nods, acknowledging your concern.

<<say $companionCloud>>Fair point. But think about it – this city is a testament to what's possible. Sure, it's gone too far, lost its humanity. But that's exactly why we need to understand it.<</say>>
He places a hand on your shoulder, his green eyes intense.

<<say $companionCloud>>Every piece of information we gather here brings us one step closer to building a better world. We just need to be smart about how we use it. But yes, we should probably slip away from them for now.<</say>>

:: Cherry Layer7 One

You and Cherry stand overlooking the vast sea of neon and metal that is the seventh layer of the Abyss. The eerie silence is punctuated only by the soft whirring of patrol robots far below. Cherry leans against a railing, her red hair a stark contrast to the metallic landscape.

<<say $companionCherry>>So... this is it. Layer seven. Deeper than anyone's ever been.<</say>>
Her voice is flat, devoid of the wonder or fear one might expect. You notice her eyes, usually dull, scanning the cityscape with a hint of... something. Interest? Resignation?

<<say $mc>>What do you think about all this, Cherry?<</say>>
She shrugs, pulling her gray-green hoodie tighter around herself.

<<say $companionCherry>>It's... different, I guess. Not sure if that's good or bad. Just... different.<</say>>

You step closer to Cherry, careful not to startle her.

<<say $mc>>Are you scared, Cherry? We're in uncharted territory here.<</say>>
For a moment, a flicker of emotion crosses her face – surprise, perhaps, at your concern.

<<say $companionCherry>>Scared? No... not really. It's all the same in the end, isn't it? Whether we die here or back on the surface... at least this view is... interesting.<</say>>
She gestures towards the sprawling cyber-dystopia below.

<<say $companionCherry>>You know, it's almost beautiful in a way. A whole city, just... existing. No people, no problems. Just machines doing their jobs. Sometimes I wonder if that would be easier...<</say>>
Her words trail off, and you're left pondering the implications of what she said. The silence stretches between you, filled only by the distant hum of the sleeping city.

:: Cherry Layer7 Three
You gesture towards the bizarre landscape stretching out before you.

<<say $mc>>This place is so strange. A whole city, buried this deep in the Abyss. What do you make of it?<</say>>
Cherry's gaze follows your hand, her expression unchanging.

<<say $companionCherry>>Strange? I guess. But isn't everything strange when you think about it? A forest, a desert, this... it's all just stuff existing where it probably shouldn't.<</say>>
A patrol robot whirs by on the street far below, its metallic footsteps echoing faintly.

<<say $mc>>But don't you find it at least a little unsettling? All these buildings, but no people?<</say>>
Cherry lets out a soft, humorless chuckle.

<<say $companionCherry>>Maybe that's the point. No people means no one to hurt, no one to be disappointed. Just machines, doing what they're supposed to do. No...<</say>>
She stops abruptly, as if catching herself. For a brief moment, you see a flicker of something – pain, perhaps – in her eyes.

<<say $companionCherry>>Anyway, we should probably move on. I'd rather not find out what happens if we stick around too long.<</say>>
With that, Cherry pushes herself away from the railing, ready to continue your journey through this strange, silent city.

:: Khemia Layer7 One

The neon lights of the city flicker ominously as you and Khemia duck behind a metallic pillar. A tax drone whirs by, its sensors scanning the area for potential "customers." Khemia's blue hair catches the glow of a nearby sign, his red cape billowing slightly in the artificial breeze or a nearby exhaust vent.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, well, well... Looks like we've stumbled into quite the dystopian nightmare, eh? Never thought I'd find a capitalist hellhole at the bottom of the Abyss.<</say>>
Khemia's eyes gleam with a mix of excitement and caution as he surveys the bizarre cityscape.

<<say $mc>>It's... not what I expected. How do you think this place came to be?<</say>>
You lean against the cool metal surface, keeping an eye out for more drones.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Now that's the question on everyone's mind, isn't it? A city this vast, this advanced... it's like nothing we've seen in the upper layers. Makes you wonder what other secrets the Abyss is hiding.<</say>>
He flashes you a roguish grin, his hand instinctively resting on the hilt of his sword.

<<say $companionKhemia>>You know, in all my expeditions, I never imagined I'd be dodging tax collectors in a ghost town of robots. It's almost poetic, don't you think? The deeper we go, the more... human our obstacles become.<</say>>

<<say $mc>>You've been on so many expeditions. How does this one compare?<</say>>
Khemia's eyes light up at your interest, a fond smile playing on his lips as he recalls his adventures.

<<say $companionKhemia>><<if $mc.appGender>5>>Oh, darling,<<else>>My friend,<</if>> this one's in a league of its own. Each layer we've passed has been more bizarre than the last, but this... this is something else entirely.<</say>>
He runs a hand through his blue hair, chuckling softly.

<<say $companionKhemia>>You know, I once thought reaching the fifth layer was the pinnacle of achievement. Now here we are, two layers deeper, in a city that shouldn't exist. It's... humbling, really. Makes you realize how little we truly know about the Abyss.<</say>>
Khemia's voice takes on a more serious tone, his usual bravado giving way to genuine awe.

<<say $companionKhemia>>But that's why we're here, isn't it? To uncover these mysteries, to push beyond what's known. And I've got to say, having you by my side makes this journey all the more thrilling.<</say>>
He winks at you, his charm never far from the surface. As you both fall silent, the hum of the robotic patrols seems to grow louder and you move on.

:: Khemia Layer7 Three

Khemia's posture shifts, becoming more alert as he considers the challenges ahead.

<<say $mc>>So, what's our next move? How do we explore this place without getting caught?<</say>>
You gesture towards the patrolling robots, concern evident in your voice.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Ah, now we're talking strategy. I like the way you think.<</say>>
He flashes you a confident grin, his eyes scanning the cityscape.

<<say $mc>>We can't just charge in sword-first this time, can we?<</say>>
You raise an eyebrow, recalling some of Khemia's more... direct approaches in the past.

<<say $companionKhemia>>You wound me! I'll have you know I'm perfectly capable of subtlety when the situation calls for it.<</say>>
He clutches his chest in mock offense, but his eyes sparkle with amusement.

<<say $companionKhemia>>But you're right, we need to be smart about this. I'm thinking we follow the local laws, play by their rules. As much as I'd love to outsmart these tin cans, we can't risk provoking them. We'll have to pay our dues and hope it grants us some freedom to explore.<</say>>
Khemia's voice carries a hint of resignation as he watches a patrol of robots march by in perfect synchronization.

<<say $companionKhemia>>One thing's for certain – we're making history with every step we take down here. And I intend to make it count, even if it means playing nice with the local bureaucracy.<</say>>
His voice carries a mix of determination and excitement, reminding you why he's considered the greatest living Abyss explorer.

:: Khemia Layer8 One

You and Khemia pause for a moment, trying to catch your breath in this disorienting landscape. The blue-haired adventurer runs a hand through his hair, his cape somehow fluttering in a non-existent breeze. His eyes dart around, taking in the impossible architecture surrounding you both.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, would you look at that? Layer eight, and we're still kicking. I've got to say, this place is giving me a run for my money.<</say>>
Khemia's usual confident grin falters for a moment as he watches a staircase fold in on itself.

<<say $mc>>How are you holding up?<</say>>
You notice Khemia's hand instinctively move to the hilt of his sword, as if seeking comfort in its familiar presence.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Me? I'm doing just fine. It's not every day you get to walk on the ceiling, is it? But I'll tell you what - this place, it's not just messing with our heads. It's messing with reality itself, somehow.<</say>>

<<say $mc>>Do you think we're even meant to be this deep in the Abyss?<</say>>
Khemia's eyes take on a thoughtful gleam, his usual bravado giving way to a more contemplative mood. He chuckles, but there's a hint of wonder in his voice.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Now that's a loaded question if I've ever heard one. Meant to be here? Hell, I don't know. But we're here all the same, aren't we?<</say>>
He gestures widely at the ever-shifting landscape around you.

<<say $companionKhemia>>You know, it's funny. The deeper we go, the more this place seems to dig into our minds. It's like... it's not just a physical place, you know? I think it's tied to us, to how we think, how we see things. Sometimes I wonder if this is even real.<</say>>
His expression grows serious, a rare sight on the usually carefree adventurer's face.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Makes you wonder, doesn't it? Are we exploring the Abyss, or is the Abyss exploring us? Hah! Listen to me, getting all philosophical. But I'll tell you this - meant to be here or not, we're making history. And that's worth all the twisted staircases in the world.<</say>>

<<say $mc>>Khemia, this place is unlike anything we've faced before. Are you sure we're prepared for what's ahead?<</say>>
Your concern seems to catch Khemia off guard. For a moment, his bravado slips, revealing a more vulnerable side. His expression softens, and he places a reassuring hand on your shoulder.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Hey now, don't you worry. We've made it this far, haven't we? But you're right, this layer... it's not playing by the rules we're used to.<</say>>
He glances around, his keen eyes scanning for potential threats.

<<say $mc>>What do you think is our biggest challenge here?<</say>>
Khemia furrows his brow, considering the question carefully.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's not just the physical dangers - though those dolls and fear manifestations are plenty to worry about. It's the way this place messes with your mind. Time, space, even our own perceptions - they're all twisted here. And we don't want to get lost with limited supplies.<</say>>
He taps his temple with a finger, a wry smile on his face.

<<say $companionKhemia>>We need to stay sharp, keep our wits about us. Trust your instincts, but don't trust your eyes. And whatever you do, don't let go of that determination that got us this far. We're making history, and I'll be damned if we don't see it through to the end.<</say>>

:: Lily Layer8 One

As you navigate the mind-bending corridors of the eighth layer, Lily skips alongside you, her pink hair defying gravity as she occasionally walks on the walls or ceiling. Her eyes sparkle with excitement, drinking in the impossible architecture around you.

<<say $companionLily>>Hey, hey! Can you believe this place? We can just go wherever we want around here!<</say>>
Lily does a cartwheel that somehow ends with her standing upright on a nearby wall. She grins at you, clearly thrilled by the surreal environment.

<<say $mc>>It's definitely... something. How are you so comfortable here?<</say>>
You struggle to maintain your balance as gravity shifts unexpectedly, making you suddenly feel lighter.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh, you know me! I've always got an ace up my sleeve. But seriously, this layer is wild! I've never seen anything quite like it. The Abyss really outdid itself this time!<</say>>
She hops from the wall to the ceiling, then back to the floor beside you, barely missing a beat.

<<say $companionLily>>You know, it's kinda like those trippy dreams where everything keeps changing, but you somehow know exactly where you are. Except this is way cooler because we're actually here!<</say>>

You raise an eyebrow at Lily's nonchalant attitude, impressed by her adaptability.

<<say $mc>>So, what do you think about the nature of the Abyss? Especially now that we're this deep?<</say>>
Lily's eyes light up at your question, and she does a little twirl that somehow defies the laws of physics.

<<say $companionLily>>Ooh, deep question for a deep place! You know, I think the Abyss is like... a living, breathing entity. Each layer is like a different facet of its personality.<</say>>
She gestures widely at the impossible architecture surrounding you.

<<say $companionLily>>This eighth layer, it's like we're inside the Abyss's imagination! It's showing us that reality isn't as fixed as we think. Maybe it's trying to expand our minds, you know?<</say>>
Lily's enthusiasm is infectious, and you find yourself smiling despite the disorienting surroundings.

<<say $companionLily>>And the deeper we go, the more I think the Abyss is testing us. Not just our physical strength, but our mental flexibility. It's like it's asking, 'How far can you push your understanding of reality?'<</say>>
With a wink, Lily does a backflip that somehow lands her on a staircase that wasn't there a moment ago.

<<say $companionLily>>But hey, that's just my take! And what do I know, anyway? What do you think? Isn't it exciting to be part of something so vast and mysterious?<</say>>
Her question hangs in the air, inviting you to ponder the true nature of your surreal surroundings.

Your brow furrows as you consider the potential dangers lurking in this twisted landscape.

<<say $mc>>Lily, aren't you worried about the risks here? We've gone deeper than anyone before us.<</say>>
Lily's smile softens, and she walks over to you, somehow managing to defy gravity and step onto a vertical wall to meet your eye level.

<<say $companionLily>>Aw, don't worry so much! Sure, it's dangerous, but that's what makes it exciting! Besides, we've made it this far, haven't we?<</say>>
She reaches out and pokes your nose playfully, then does a graceful flip back to the "floor."

<<say $mc>>But what about those fear manifestations? And the doll-like beings?<</say>>
Lily's expression becomes thoughtful, a rare sight that reminds you there's more to her than just boundless enthusiasm.

<<say $companionLily>>You know, those are tricky. But here's the thing - fear only has power if you let it. Those manifestations? They're just the Abyss trying to psych us out. And those dolls? Well, they're creepy for sure, but we'll face them together!<</say>>
She winks at you, a mischievous glint in her eye that hints at hidden depths of experience.

<<say $companionLily>>Listen, I know it seems impossible, but that's the beauty of it! We're writing history here, exploring where no one else has gone before. Just stick with me, and we'll turn this maze into our playground!<</say>>

Maru's eyes light up at your question, a mix of curiosity and apprehension swirling in them.

<<say $mc>>That's an interesting thought, Maru. What do you think about the nature of the Abyss?<</say>>
Maru pauses, gathering his thoughts as he watches a staircase above you suddenly invert itself.

<<say $companionMaru>>I've always believed the Abyss was just a dangerous, unexplored part of our world. But now... I'm not so sure. This layer, it feels like we've stepped into a place where the laws of physics don't apply.<</say>>
He gestures around, his movements graceful despite the unsettling environment.

<<say $companionMaru>>The way space and time bend here, it's as if we're witnessing the impossible become possible. Each layer seems to challenge our understanding of reality in new ways.<</say>>
Your companion's insightful observation surprises you, revealing a depth of thought behind his usual shy demeanor.

<<say $companionMaru>>What if... what if the Abyss is a manifestation of the unknown? A place where the boundaries of our world break down? It's like we're peering through cracks in reality itself.<</say>>
Maru's brow furrows as he continues his train of thought.

<<say $companionMaru>>Maybe each layer represents a different aspect of our world pushed to its extreme. The forest layer might be nature unbound, while this one... it could be the very concept of space and dimensions taken to its illogical conclusion.<</say>>
He looks at you, a mix of excitement and trepidation in his eyes.

<<say $companionMaru>>If that's true, what does it mean for us as we descend further? Are we leaving our reality behind bit by bit? And what awaits us at the bottom... if there even is one?<</say>>
He shudders, but tries to bush the weighty implications off.

<<say $companionMaru>>But I don't really know, I guess. I mean, I don't even know if I <i>can</i> know. So we've just got to keep doing our best, no matter what this place is!<</say>>
His willingness to push past his fears is somehow reassuring, even in a place like this.

<<say $companionMaru>>Thank you. It's just... those things we keep seeing at the edge of our vision. They remind me of the dolls I used to play with as a child, but twisted somehow.<</say>>
He shudders, his hair falling across his face as he looks down.

Your words seem to bolster Maru's courage. He straightens up, smoothing out his dress with newfound determination.

<<say $companionMaru>>You're right. We've made it this far, haven't we? Farther than anyone else. Maybe... maybe that means we're meant to be here, to uncover the Abyss's secrets.<</say>>
A spark of excitement replaces the fear in Maru's eyes, and you're reminded of the experienced diver beneath his delicate exterior.

As you navigate the mind-bending corridors of the eighth layer, you notice Saeko scribbling furiously in her notebook, her brow furrowed in concentration. She adjusts her red glasses, pushing them up the bridge of her nose.

<<say $companionSaeko>>This layer... the spatial distortions here are truly remarkable. From a scientific perspective, it's more interesting than anything else we've encountered, but I must admit, it's also rather... disconcerting.<</say>>
She glances around nervously, her modest gray coat seeming to blend with the stark white surroundings.

<<say $mc>>It's certainly a lot to take in. What do you make of it all?<</say>>
You watch as Saeko's expression shifts, her academic curiosity battling with a hint of fear.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Well, from what I can observe, the laws of physics as we know them are being completely rewritten here. It's as if space itself is... malleable. What worries me most is the complete absence of any recognizable plant life. In a place where even space bends without any apparent reason, how would life adapt?<</say>>
She pauses, her voice dropping slightly.
<<say $companionSaeko>>Though I can't help but wonder about the toll this environment might take on our minds. Have you noticed any... strange occurrences? Visions, perhaps?<</say>>

You lean against a plain white wall, and probe her about her thoughts on the Abyss.

<<say $mc>>What are your thoughts on the nature of the Abyss, especially now that we've reached this deep?<</say>>
Saeko's eyes light up at the question, her academic passion momentarily overshadowing her unease.

<<say $companionSaeko>>It's a complex question, isn't it? The Abyss defies our understanding of natural laws, and this layer exemplifies that perfectly. I have several theories, though none are fully satisfactory.<</say>>
She gestures to the impossible architecture around you.

<<say $companionSaeko>>One possibility is that the Abyss is a convergence of multiple dimensions, each layer representing a different plane of reality bleeding into our own. Another theory is that it's an ancient construct, perhaps created by a long-lost civilization with technology far beyond our comprehension. Or it could be a natural phenomenon, a weak point in the fabric of our universe where the laws of physics break down.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Those are fascinating theories. Do you think understanding the nature of the Abyss could help us navigate it better?<</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>In theory, yes. Knowledge is our best tool here. The more we understand about the Abyss, the better equipped we are to face its challenges. But...<</say>>
She hesitates, her voice wavering.
<<say $companionSaeko>>I fear that truly comprehending the Abyss might be beyond human capability. We might be like ants trying to understand quantum physics. Still, we must try. For science, for humanity, and for ourselves.<</say>>

Saeko's shoulders relax slightly, and a small, grateful smile crosses her face.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Thank you. I... I try to maintain a professional demeanor, but this place... it challenges everything I thought I knew about reality. The logical part of my brain is fascinated, but another part is... well, terrified.<</say>>
She takes a deep breath, her hand unconsciously gripping the fabric of her gray coat.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I've been seeing things. Shadows at the corner of my vision, shapes that shouldn't exist. And sometimes, I swear I can hear whispers in languages I don't understand. Is it just me, or...?<</say>>

<<say $mc>>You're not alone, Saeko. I've experienced similar things. This layer seems designed to play tricks on our minds.<</say>>
Relief washes over Saeko's face, and she nods.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Of course. It's likely a consequence of the spatial distortions affecting our perception. We should document these experiences thoroughly. They could provide valuable insights into the nature of this layer and its effects on human cognition.<</say>>
Her academic instincts kick in, providing a sense of familiarity and comfort to her.

:: Khemia Joyous Sunder

Khemia's practicing with the newly modified Joyous Sunder, its blade glinting as he moves through a series of fluid motions.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Check this out. This Joyous Sunder is something else entirely.<</say>>
You approach, watching as Khemia effortlessly slices through a nearby boulder, leaving a perfectly smooth cut.

<<say $mc>>That's impressive. How does it compare to your usual sword?<</say>>
Khemia grins, twirling the blade with expert precision.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's like night and day. My regular sword requires technique, strength, and precision. This thing? It's almost too easy. Watch this.<</say>>
In a blur of motion, Khemia swings the Joyous Sunder through a thick tree trunk. The top half slides off with a soft thud, revealing a mirror-smooth surface.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Incredible, right? But here's the thing – it's almost *too* powerful. In a real fight, I'll actually have to be careful not to hurt myself or anyone nearby.<</say>>
You nod, understanding the double-edged nature of such a potent Relic.

<<say $mc>>I can see how that could be dangerous. Do you think it'll be useful on our expedition?<</say>>
Khemia's eyes light up with excitement.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Absolutely! This beauty could make short work of anything we could encounter. Or at least, anything I could possibly fight! Plus, think of all the obstacles we could clear. Blocked passages, ancient sealed doors – nothing could stand in our way!<</say>>
He pauses, a mischievous glint in his eye.

<<say $companionKhemia>>And between you and me, I've always wanted to carve my name on the moon. Think this could reach that far?<</say>>
You can't help but laugh at his exaggerated enthusiasm.

<<say $mc>>Let's focus on reaching the bottom of the Abyss first, shall we?<</say>>
Khemia chuckles, sheathing the Joyous Sunder with a flourish, ensuring the weapon is fully secured by the handle so that the blade can't touch the sheath.

<<say $companionKhemia>>True enough. But mark my words, this Relic is going to be a game-changer. The secrets of the Abyss won't stand a chance against us now.<</say>>
