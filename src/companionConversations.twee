Maru cheerfully brings you a meal he made, checking to see if it is as satisfying as he hopes it is.

:: Maru Convo1 Childhood
<<set $companionMaru.affec+=(1+$hsswear)>>\
<<say $mc>>Could you tell me something about your<<if $IQdrop >15>>, like,<</if>> childhood?<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>> Well, I was mostly raised by my big sister. She was nice, but not exactly the most gentle person ever. Maybe overprotective would be a better way to describe it. When I was younger I wasn't really allowed to play outside or do anything that might be too rough. Sometimes it was a little annoying, but I understand why she was doing it.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>I can <<if $IQdrop >15>>you know, totally <</if>>imagine that was a little tough.<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>>Yeah, but it wasn't all bad. I think she was just looking out for me, since I am the youngest. We were a very tight family, so we did a lot of stuff with each other. And in a way it forced me to learn to cook and sow as well, since I wanted to do things with my sister.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Is that also the reason why you are wearing <<if $IQdrop >20>>, like super duper<</if>> feminine clothing? Were they<<if $IQdrop >10>>, like,<</if>> forcing you to do this?<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>> No! No, nothing like that. As a child I think I looked pretty feminine.  Well, even more than now I mean. My sisters liked to play dress-up with me, and I actually liked it too. Sometimes I thought that I shouldn't be doing it, but eventually I realized that if it makes me happy, then there's no reason I should stop.<</say>>
He pauses for a moment as he seems to gather his thoughts.

<<say $companionMaru>> Over time I really began to appreciate how well my sisters cared for me. I don't know if it's the same for everyone, but I was glad they accepted what I liked and we could do things together and be happy.<</say>>
You ponder his story for a bit.

<<say $mc>> Thanks for<<if $IQdrop >20>>, like,<</if>> sharing that with me. How are your sisters doing?<</say>>
His expression falls, and he looks down in silence for a few seconds before responding. 

<<say $companionMaru>>They all left.<</say>>
After a few more moments he forces a smile and continues. 

<<say $companionMaru>> Anyway, don't let your meal get cold!<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Oh, sure, thanks for the <<if $IQdrop >15>>totally yummy <</if>>meal!<</say>>
As you take in the food, you realize it takes shockingly good for something made with such limited ingredients. How did he manage to get the texture just right and the flavors perfectly balanced all the way down here? Maru giggles as he looks at you eating his food.

<<say $companionMaru>> Well, if you like it this much, I'll be sure to make it like this more often!<</say>>

<<say $mc>>Why do you wear<<if $IQdrop >10>>, like,<</if>> such feminine clothes if you're a guy? It's <<if $IQdrop >15>>, like totally,<<else>>really<</if>> weird.<</say>>
Maru almost chokes on his food and starts nervously stammering.

<<say $companionMaru>> I... I don't know, it just started as a kid and now I just like it I guess.<</say>>

Maru looks a bit downward. He opens his mouth as if to say something before closing it again. After a moment he replies.

<<say $mc>>Like it? It's absolutely delicious!<</say>>
Maru smiles widely at your comment.

<<say $companionMaru>> Well, in that case it would be cruel for me to not tell you the recipe! Even if it is made from the limited ingredients we have with us here!<</say>>
Maru tells you in detail how he prepared the dish. It's actually pretty simple, but he added some herbs with subtle flavors which seem to have a made a big difference in the final product. And his cooking method was precise to ensure the texture ended up perfect!

You give Lily a big hug and you immediately feel her firmly squeezing you back, even lifting your feet a litlle bit from the ground in her excitement.

<<say $mc>>Hey! Yeah, I'm $mc.name, and I'm<<if $IQdrop >10>>, like,<</if>> so happy that you're joining our team!<</say>>
She releases her grip on you and smiles widely.

<<say $companionLily>>I didn't expect such a warm welcome, but hey I'm not complaining! Especially from such a cute <<PerceivedGender>>.<</say>>
She winks at you and grins as she finishes her comment. You weren't sure if you were going for the cute vibe, but at the very least you want to be taken seriously as an adventurer. On the other hand, you suppose it's good that your new teammate likes you.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh my, we only just met and you already know what to say to get my engine running!<</say>>
Lily steps forward to approach you, and it almost seems like she's leaning in for a kiss. But before you can react, you suddenly feel a hard pat on your back and open your eyes to see Lily with the widest grin possible on her face.

<<say $companionLily>>But let's not jump the gun here <<mrms>> cassanova. We have a whole adventure ahead of us to get to know each other better.<</say>>

<<say $companionLily>>Haha! Don't worry about it <<mrms>> hero. I can take pretty good care of myself. But I'll be sure to let you know just in case I find some other damsel in distress you can save.<</say>>
She starts snicker at her own joke. You're not quite sure if it's a joke at your expense, but she doesn't seem to clarify. Regardless, she seems to be in good spirits and that's what's important in the end, right?

You close your eyes and move your face close to kiss her. But as your face approached hers, your cheeks are suddenly grabbed with suprising strength as Lily pushes you back with an annoyed scoff.

<<say $companionLily>>There is something to be said about being so forward... But there's also something about not reading signals correctly, right?<</say>>

Lily sighs deeply and her face lightens up a little bit as she raises her eyebrows.

<<say $companionLily>>Yeah, maybe I do know? Well, I guess I am an awfully cute little angel, right?<</say>>
She frames her face between her hands as she gives you a sly smile once again.

Lily grins, straightens her back, and puts on a mock formal voice.

<<say $companionLily>>Well thank you for asking <<mrms>> boss <<PerceivedGender>>. My hobbies include listening to pop music and traveling. I've traveled to lots of the countries around this world already! What can I say? I guess I'm just the adventurous type. <</say>>
You mimic her tone and play along.

<<say $mc>> Ah yes, <<if $IQdrop >15>>, like, super duper<<else>>excellent<</if>> to hear that miss Lily, what would you<<if $IQdrop >5>>, like,<</if>> say your...<</say>>
Before you can finish your sentence, she interrupts you.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh, and anime too! The best thing is if I can combine both! I once travelled half way around the world for this awesome anime convention. You wouldn't believe the cute little snacks they had over there. Sometimes I wish I could go back, but in my life I prefer to always move forward and not get fixated on the past. Oh, but there was this other time where...<</say>>
In the end Lily rambles on for quite a while about her various travels, what anime see likes, what songs she like, and what anime songs she likes. Even if you can't quite follow all of her stories or don't know much about the places she mentions, she seems happy as long as you make an effort and nod along.

Lily looks you over with a raised eyebrow after which a smile quickly forms on her face.

She pokes you in your sides playfully as she talks.

<<say $companionLily>>So tell me more about yourself. What do you like? Do you do these kinds of expeditions often? I always really love going on new adventures and exploring!<</say>>
You talk for quite some time afterwards. She is actually quite attentive and interested in what you have to say, although she does tend to go on a rambling streak from time to time when you give her the chance.

Lily seems to almost immediately perk up out of her stupor.

<<say $companionLily>>The future, to be honest.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Ow yeah, that's pretty different from the past. So what about the future?<</say>>
Lily scratches her head and looks up.

<<say $companionLily>>I don't know and that's a little bit the issue. I have some clear idea's on what I want but I'm not sure how to make them compatible.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Well surely if you think about it you can try to make it work! What do you exactly want that seems so incompatible to you?<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>Well on the one hand I like to have a vibrant social life! Maybe I should say I need it. If I start sharing all my awesome stories with tree they'll lock me up before long!<</say>>
You both giggle a bit at that mental image.

<<say $companionLily>>But more seriously, I want to have friends and maybe even a family of my own at some point.

She lets out a passionate sound that resembles a high pitched moan. Then she continues to pull her bra down, revealing her perfect breasts, one of which has a single bead of milk dangling from the nipple.

<<say $companionLily>>Come here, sweety.<</say>>
She pushes your head against the nipple of her breast. You put up something of a weak struggle, as you don't want to hurt her, but you're willing to go along with her at this point. Her strong arms don't move an inch.

<<say $companionLily>>Very good, I'm so proud on you.<</say>>
Lily lets out a soft moan and firmly holds your head to her breast.

<<say $companionLily>>This feels so much better already... You and me, we're going to do this more often.<</say>>
She lets out a small giggle as she strokes your $app.hair hair softly as you continue to drink.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, I don't mean to brag, but I did almost beat a Dune Devouring Borer once. It was a shame I broke my sword on its rock-hard hide, but I was almost able to subdue it anyway. I swear if I had a stronger weapon then I could have even killed the beast!<</say>>

He suddenly cuts you off before you're able to finish your thought.

<<say $companionKhemia>>And once, we were running low on supplies and  everybody thought they were done for. Things were getting really desperate and the main diver was even saying some prayers, like he didn't think we were gonna make it. But I led them through a cave complex I'd known from a previous dive, showed them a shortcut to a nice foraging spot and a quicker path back up to the surface. By the time we were back to the surface we even had a few days of supplies to spare! <</say>>

You pause for a moment, taking stock of where you are. Looking back, you notice that Khemia has picked up a stick and appears to be performing some kind of sword kata. You watch him, fascinated by his movements. The way he darts and spins, always keeping his balance over where he is, or where he's going to be. He flows between forms, dodging imaginary opponents, and apparently dispatching them one after another. The more you watch though, the more you think this isn't just some memorized kata, he's improvising, creating a dynamic scenario in his head, and reacting to it.

He performs an improbable flip in the air, lashing out with the stick, and then driving it down into the dirt on his landing.

He's breathing heavily, but there's no trembling in his motions as he stands and looks over at you. He smirks.

Your voice rises high as you charge towards Khemia. You swing your stick at his head, trying to wipe the smug expression from his cool, unfliching face. But Khemia moves like a serpent, effortlessly dodging the blow, and slips a foot in right in front of your trailing leg, kicking it back, and throwing you completely off balance. You flail about, your momentum taking you forward and down, and in spite of your efforts you land face first on the ground, your stick bouncing out of your hand. You feel Khemia gently touch your back with his own stick, and then you hear him let out a booming laugh.

Khemia's expression goes flat, controlled. You can tell there's something he wants to say, but he doesn't seem to have trouble holding back as his body language and voice become cold.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Very well.<</say>>
You're nearly certain he's lost quite a bit of respect for you.

Cherry stares at you, then a minute passes. Finally, Cherry exhales.

You chuckle a bit at your own joke. Surely your succesful art-themed joke will resonate with her and lighten the mood!

Cherry's eyes focus on you, and for a moment you think you see a hint of an emotion. However, her eyes still look haunted, and she doesn't say anything in response to your brilliant humor.

As you both set off again, her gait isn't energetic. But still she walks, with a trudging endurance, bearing a burden that you don't understand. In some ways, it's even more impressive that she's able to keep moving on a journey like this despite her emotional state.

A silent wave of anguish washes over her, an obvious change, but one with only subtle manifestations on her face.

A tear rolls down her cheek, but she doesn't seem to notice as she continues staring into the distance.

<<say $companionCherry>>Sometimes things just happen around me. That time, she paid the price.<</say>>
A few more wet trails join the first rolling down her face.

She still looks sad, and you suspect she has more issues than simply grief, since so little of the world seems to make it through to her. But perhaps you've helped lessen her pain just a little bit.

Her tears are drying, and you can see a small seed of resolve growing in her.
As you both rise to resume your exploration of the Abyss, there's a hint of discipline and energy in her steps that wasn't there before. Her problems definitely haven't been solved after one conversation, but perhaps you've taken the first big step on a path to help her through them.

She desperately evades your eye contact, her eyes burrow a hole deep into the ground between you.

<<say $mc>>But now that you've admitted it, maybe we can work something out.<</say>>
You wink at her and reveal a breast. But Cherry starts blinkng rapidly as she turns around to give you some privacy.

<<say $companionCherry>>No, no, I definitely didn't mean it that way. I really was only interested in the milk itself.<</say>>
You dress yourself once again upon hearing her say that and look at her, a hint of confusion obvious on your face.

<<say $mc>>Oh, okay, I'm sorry about that. Why do you want the milk?<</say>>
<<say $companionCherry>>You probably think it's stupid, but I've been called the black cat of the family for the longest time. And now I'm kind of living up to that nickname, and I sort of want some milk right now...<</say>>
Her voice trails off, as if she can't bring herself to explain her desires to you so openly.

<<say $mc>>Not the black sheep?<</say>>
<<say $companionCherry>>No, the black cat. I guess it's because I've always been an unlucky omen for them. And I guess some part of me wished I was really a black cat, and not a person.<</say>>
<<say $companionCherry>> I wouldn't have to interact with people anymore and nobody would expect anything of me. I could finally live a peaceful, happy life.<</say>>
She looks down in silence. Her embarassment has faded, leaving her with an empty expression, as if she's stopped caring about anything in the world.

<<say $mc>>Cherry that's...<</say>>
<<say $companionCherry>> I know, I know. But, well, ever since I got <<if $companionCherry.curses.some(e => e.name === "Fluffy Ears")>>these ears<<else>>this tail<</if>> I've been somewhat...<</say>>
<<say $companionCherry>> Happier...<</say>>
She looks at you and gives you a weak smile. It isn't joyful, but it's something. Which really is saying something for someone like Cherry.

<<say $companionCherry>>I just thought drinking milk from a saucer like a cat could add to that. But, well, milk is pretty hard to come by down here so... Yeah...<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Ah, I get it. But I'm not sure I've ever seen a real cat drink milk from a saucer and I think we don't have proper saucers here.<</say>>
Cherry's face turns into a pout, and manages to wordlessly cut off any complaints you have about the situation.

<<say $mc>>You know what, give me a second.<</say>>
You grab one of the dishes from your backback and squeeze your nipple a few times to squirt some milk onto it. You repeat to process until at least the bottom of the dish is covered with a creamy, white fluid. Then you cover yourself again and turn to Cherry.

<<say $mc>>Like this?<</say>>
You place the dish with milk on the ground and see Cherry's eyes widen, as if she didn't expect you to comply with such an usual desire she had. At first she seemed bashful that you're not leaving her alone, but eventually, she gets on all fours, as if she fully embraced a feline identity. Then she slowly approaches the milk and begins lapping it up.

<<say $mc>>You know, you're pretty cute like this.<</say>>
You start petting her on her head and run your hands through her hair, causing her to tense up, but eventually she relaxes and even leans into your hand as your pet her.

You can't help but crack up a little at the absurdity of the proposal.

<<say $companionCloud>>Why are you asking?<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Uh, I don't know. I, uh... just wanted to know how good you were I guess?<</say>>
After an awkward moment, he starts to break out in a grin once again.

<<say $companionCloud>>Ah, I see. Well, if I'm being honest, then the answer is yes, I have.<</say>>
You can't help but hold you breath in anticipation of the story.

<<say $companionCloud>>I always slay at parties! People have told me I'm dangerously funny. <</say>>
The awkwardness is defused as he walks off, laughing at his own joke, and leaving you standing there feeling a little silly.

:: Cloud Convo1
As you were walking, Cloud suddenly sprints ahead a few meters and kneels by the side of the road. When you walk over, you see him hunched over a body with multiple injuries which seem to be bullet wounds, or maybe stab wounds?

<<say $mc>> What do you think happened to him? Do you think it could have been the bandits we were warned about earlier?<</say>>
<<say $companionCloud>> Hard to say for sure, but it it were bandits, they were either cruel or simple amateurs, who wouldn't pose a real threat to us.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> What makes you say that? <</say>>
Cloud points to a spot on the back of the corpse.

<<say $companionCloud>> Look, here. He was shot in the back. <</say>>
You see cloud moving the body onto its belly to point at a gunshot wound in the upper back.

<<say $companionCloud>> But it seems off target, if you look at the angle of entry and the trauma around the shoulders, the bullet is probably lodged in there somewhere near the shoulder blades.<</say>>
He then pushes the body onto its back and points at the other wounds.

<<say $companionCloud>> And these are stab wounds, but every single one missed a vital organ. Based on the amount of blood here, my guess is that he bled out in the end after managing to get away at first.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> That sounds pretty gruesome, why would they do that to him? <</say>>

You hunch to check the bag as you speak.

<<say $companionCloud>> Of course, I am a notorious former bandit. I'm surprised you didn't know.<</say>>
Cloud grins and you simply stare at him in shock.

<<say $companionCloud>> I became quite infamous after stealing the hearts of countless ladies and a few men with my daring escapades. Alas, those days are long gone and now I must work to change things in the world above so that all people can have true freedom, without fear of governments or bandits.<</say>>
He looks up wistfuly and has a big, goofy grin on his face, seemingly not worried about your response. You laugh a bit, but a part of you wonders whether it was truly a joke or if it had a hint of truth within.

You have to be willing to get your hands dirty and do what it takes to get an advantage here. We didn't hurt him and its not like he'll be using the coins any more, right? We might as well make use of anything we can to make sure we survive. With the way the world is right now, that's what you have to do to survive.<</say>>
He opens the pack on the ground, pulls out a few dubloons and tosses them your way. 

<<say $companionCloud>> Don't get me wrong, it's good you have some moral compass.<</say>>
He pauses and steels his gaze even more

<<say $companionCloud>> But I hate naieve people as they tend to end up like this.<</say>>
Cloud looks up wistfully as if at some unseen dream, but then shakes his head.

<<say $companionCloud>> You seem to be leaking.<</say>>
You feel an intense heat fill your cheeks as you blush a deep red. Meanwhile Cloud seems nonplussed at his statement of fact.

<<say $mc>>Yeah, sorry, I'm still not used to the fact that I'm lactating.<</say>>
<<say $companionCloud>> I can tell. But I think you should probably try to get used to it, since it may last quite a while.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Yeah, I know, but I didn't think they would start leaking already.<</say>>
Cloud seems to consider this for a moment, then he comes up with an idea.

	You turn around and raise your arms above your head.
	<<say $mc>>Why exactly am I doing this?<</say>>
	<<say $companionCloud>>So this is easier.<</say>>
	Cloud lifts off your clothes, leading you to attempt to cover your breasts at the sudden exposure. When you look back, he's standing there with a wide, disarming smile.

	Cloud shrugs, apparently discarding his planned solution.
	<<say $companionCloud>> Because I was about to do something for you. But nevermind, I hope you work it out.<</say>>

	<<set $companionCloud.affec+=(1+$hsswear)>>\
	<<say $mc>>Okay, I trust you.<</say>>
	With some hesitation, you turn around again and put your arms up. Cloud quickly finishes the process of disrobing you, leaving you with your bare breasts out and exposed.

	<<say $companionCloud>> Now, this is the part where you need to relax, just close your eyes and think of wide, green, peaceful fields.<</say>>
	You do as he says and close your eyes while you imagine yourself in a field back on the surface, the sun shining on your face and the grass is tickling your feet.

	You feel Cloud's hands touch your breasts and slowly begin to massage them. He has a very tender touch despite his strength and even though your breasts are sensitive, it is quite pleasant.

	<<say $companionCloud>> Now, follow my lead.<</say>>
	You feel his hands slowly guiding you down to your knees and bending you forward on your hands. He softly begins to tug your teats and milk starts spurting out. You feel an immediate sense of relief from your breasts as your stockpile of milk is reduced.
	
	<<say $mc>>That does feel good.<</say>>
	<<say $companionCloud>>I told you it would. I used to do something like this quite a bit, back in the day.<</say>>
	You startle, but any movement is blocked by Cloud's body that is hunched over you.

	<<say $mc>>You massaged a lot of breasts?<</say>>
	<<say $companionCloud>> Ha, I'm neither going to confirm nor deny that, but that's not what I meant.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>>Oh, okay?<</say>>
	You relax a bit a imagine yourself in the green pastures again.

	<<say $companionCloud>> No, back in the day I had some experience with dealing with restless cows.<</say>>
	Cloud moves over to the side, while continuing to massage the milk out of your teats.
	
	<<say $companionCloud>>I wasn't a farmer, but sometimes I'd travel and it was good to get something from them. So I would slowly approach them, cuddle them a bit from the side, and then I could help myself to the freshest possible milk, while helping them relieve their swollen udders.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>>Are you calling me a cow??<</say>>
	Suddenly, you can only imagine youself in the same green pasture, with Cloud milking your udders. The thought is surprisingly more pleasant and less insulting than you expected.

	<<say $companionCloud>> Chill out, I'm not calling anybody anything. I'm just saying I know how to help you.<</say>>
	You ponder what he means and the fact that he has been able to help quite a bit already. Then, finally, Cloud squirts the last of your milk out from your nipples with a bit more force, giving you an incredibly satisfying sense of release.

	<<say $mc>><<if $IQdrop>20 >>HmmmMMMooooo! <<else>>Hmmmmmm! <</if>><</say>>
	<<say $companionCloud>> That's what I thought. You know where you can find me, if your udders get swollen again.<</say>>
	He releases your breasts and gives you a solid slap on your butt, then lets out a hard laugh as he walks away to let you recover.

She cocks an eyebrow as a response.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Magical wonders? You don't seem to understand the gravity of what we will be encountering in the Abyss. It is not that there are simply a series of 'magical' wondrous things that we can enjoy, it is an apparent gap in our understanding of the rules of the universe. Even the simplest of the Relics or Wonders we will observe in the Abyss simply break the rules that humans have held dear for hundreds of years. We need to rethink everything that we know about the universe. But they do follow their own rules, so they can be scientifically studied.<</say>>
Saeko seems to be getting more invested now, she begins speaking more enthusiastically about Abyssal research.

<<say $companionSaeko>>And while I don't expect to immediately understand why the Abyss does what it does, I think we can at least understand how it works on a surface level. How does Miasma alter developmental processes? How long have the species in the Abyss been evolving? Can we make use of the mutational effects of the miasma intentionally in a controlled manner, perhaps cure medical conditions? The potential is nearly limitless and we need to see what we can learn from it.<</say>>
Saeko continues to talk about recent advances in research regarding the Abyss and the immense potential that the Abyss has, if we could only understand it well enough to use it. You don't get much of a chance to speak, but it is very informative.

<<set $companionSaeko.affec+=(1+$hsswear)>>\
<<say $mc>>Yeah, I'm thrilled to delve into all the mysteries the Abyss holds!<</say>>
You see a twinkle in her eyes and the edges of her lips curl upwards.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Me too! I actually have a new theory about the effects of miasma on the flora and fauna native to the Abyss. I hypothesize that while some organisms display the effects of an acute mutation due to miasma exposure, others show an evolution over a long period of time in the Abyss. And I think if we can identify which species have evolved in the Abyss, then we can identify their most recent common ancestor with known surface species. If we do that, we can get a better understanding of what changes long-term colonization of the Abyss had on them and even when the species diverged!<</say>>
She blushes a bit, noticing she may be getting a bit carried away.

<<say $companionSaeko>>But yeah, you might not want to hear all about it. I understand. Suffice to say that I think there is a lot we can learn and I'm quite interested in learning it.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>No, please continue! I don't know if I'll be completely able to understand, but maybe it could be useful for the trip.<</say>>
Saeko smiles widely and perks up at your interest.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Well, if you say so. Anyway, I think that if we can see the common ancestors of Abyssal species to surface species, then we can create bounds on the age of the Abyss. Like if the flairabou of the 4th layer diverged from a surface mammal 500,000 years ago, then we can conclude the Abyss must be at least 500,000 years old. That's just an example, I haven't analyzed the flairabou yet. Though I hypothesize the oldest diverging species may be on the lower levels, so if we don't go deep enough then we won't be able to put an upper bound on the age of the Abyss. <</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>And also, we may be able to learn about how the Abyss alters the evolution of the species within. If we raised a flairabou outside the Abyss, would it have the same properties or does it rely on the miasma of the Abyss to mutate its body in a certain way to stay alive? Do we need to worry about Dune Devouring Borers colonizing the Sahara if someone brought them to the surface? Right now, no one knows, but I think these are important questions to ask and I hope that further analysis of Abyssal flora and fauna can provide answers to these questions.<</say>>
Saeko continues her explanation for a while, posing more questions, hypotheses, and experiments she'd like to do to test them. You can't quite follow everything she says, as she's clearly a better researcher than teacher, but she's glad you're paying attention and tries to explain anything you ask about.

	<<say $companionAI>> Or maybe you like to take the Chain of Lorelei to make seem a little bit more feminine by changing your voice to melodic singers voice.<</say>>

	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_lecturing.png">> <<say $companionAI>> The final Relic I have info on is a bit of an odd one though, the Creepy Doll. It seems a few people have taken it before, but somehow it always ended up back in the Abyss. There were a few groups that said it did absolutely nothing besides looking creepy, but others who were traveling by themselves and said that the doll 'kept them safe'.

	<<say $mc>> Can you be serious for a second, Ai?<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_plotting.png">> <<say $companionAI>> To be honest, I was only half joking there. You need to be careful though, because while they are mild, they also won't give you much corruption.<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>>Pick up too many Relics and you'll be forced to go down a layer to get enough corruption to come back up, or wave goodbye to <<if $app.breastsCor > 1 >>those nice huggable assets of yours<<elseif $app.penisCor>1>>that fun tool between your legs<</if>>, since Shrunken Assets is the only Curse that will give a lot of corruption on this layer.<</say>>

	<<say $mc>> Thanks for the heads up.<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>>Oh also, if you take a Dizzying Heights Curse, your fate is sealed.<</say>>

	<<say $companionAI>>I mean that you can't cheat the Abyss. If you choose to shrink, and then get rid of the Curse at the Icon of Mercy that's somewhere on this layer, the Abyss will remember and you'll continue to shrink in the future, no matter what the source of the change is.<</say>>

	<<say $mc>> So it basically a refund?<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> Yes, exactly!<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Well, that doesn't sound too useful unless I make a bad choice with a Curse I don't want.<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_lecturing.png">> <<say $companionAI>> First of all, we are on the very first layer. Of course the wonder is not going to be some omnipotent marvel...<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> And second of all, there are more reasons than simple regret. <</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_lecturing.png">> <<say $companionAI>>Some divers get random inflictions of Curses from the Abyss. So it can be very helpful to get rid of such unwanted Curses. But you could also strategize around using a Curse temporarily.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Why would I do that?<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> Some Curses could give you a benefit while exploring the Abyss, even if you'd want to get rid of it later, not all Curses are purely negative.<</say>>

	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_smirk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Things on this layer can get wild! The baying gourmet is a quadrapedal beast that roams through this dark forest. It has a ravenous appetite, so it will probably come after you if it smells food, then the ravenous beast may end up ravishing you. What a delicious feast your body could be!<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> If you're done with a the double entendres, maybe you could tell me how to deal with it?<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_bummed.png">> <<say $companionAI>> You can be a real killjoy, you know that?<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_lecturing.png">> <<say $companionAI>> To be honest, the beast is only a beast if you seem like easy prey. If you seem like a tough foe or put up a serious fight it'll run away with it's tail between its legs.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> What would make me seem threatening to it?<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> You could be in a large group of divers, but others ways could work as well. Scaring it off with some combat-oriented Relics or getting changed by Curses that make you seem like a big threat could also work.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Hmm... I think I might be able to use that. Thanks AI.<</say>>

	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_sassy_talk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Where would you be without me?<</say>>

	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_annoyed.png">> <<say $companionAI>> How about this crappy micro chip detaches itself from your phone and you can figure out the rest?<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Okay, Okay. I'm sorry already. Just tell me about the Relics on this layer okay? <</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> Very well, first of all I will strongly advise you to pick up the Heart-Stealing Stole as it hopefull will make you a bit more suffarable to me and your other companions. You seem to need it.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Ouch...<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> The World Stone, might also not be a bad idea for you.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Why?<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_smirk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Because when everybody inevitably leaves you, you can atleast train your body more so you can haul back all Relics by yourself.<</say>>

		Suddenly it dawns on you that she is refering to the altered state of your body and how it increases the risk of you actually wetting yourself and you blush deeply.

		<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_neutral_happy.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Well if you really want some insight in how you will end up, you might also pick up the Dream Glazer.

		<<say $mc>> That's.. actually pretty usefull advise.<</say>>

	<<say $mc>> ...My what?<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_plotting.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Don't pretend to be more innocent then you are. Remember, I have access to all your phone data...<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Are you messing with me again, Ai?<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> Maybe... Maybe not. Anyway, if you truly don't want anything to do with the animalistic Curses that manifest on this layer then you can still use them to your advantage.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> I'm all ears.<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_smirk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Well, if you're into cute, fuzzy ears then there is a Curse for that to on this layer. But I meant that you if you get the Maximum Fluff Curse here, and the hairless Curse afterwards on the first layer. Et voila! Free corruption!<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> That's actually not a bad strategy, but it does require me to move back up again... Thanks Ai, I'll keep it in mind for when it's convenient. Anything else?<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_excited_excited.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Well my favorite two Curses are also on this layer. Futa Fun and Sex Switcheroo. Anyone would be interested in those! <</say>>

		You cock an eyebrow at her avatar.

		<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_drooling.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Second of all, lets say I have some experience with those 'curses' and it can lead to some pretty steamy situations...<</say>>
		<<say $mc>> Okay... Anything else I could use?<</say>>
		<<say $companionAI>> Hmmmmm <</say>>
		<<say $mc>> Hello? Earth to AI? <</say>>

	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_grin.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Hey, it's nothing to be embarassed about! Maybe later I can give you some tips about how to best take advantage of your new parts.<</say>>

	<<say $mc>> Can you give me some information on any Wonders on this layer?<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> Sure! There are two here, but I guess it might be a little late to give you info on the Empty-handed Broker, so that leaves us with the Fate-Crossing Star's pond. If you enter it then you'll wake up as somebody else entirely! It will always be one of your traveling companions though.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Uh... that sounds as intrusive as it gets. I don't think anyone would be happy if I did that<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_plotting2.png">> <<say $companionAI>> You bet they would be pissed, but what will they do? Go back up alone and leave their original body behind? I don't think you need to worry about them leaving you if you're in their body.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> You can be pretty scary, you know... What would I even get if I change bodies?<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_excited_excited.png">> <<say $companionAI>> First of all, you get corruption for it. Beside that there are loads of other options with it, but the most important one is the possible gender swap!<</say>>
	You sigh, recognizing the obvious pattern in the topics Ai seems to enjoy.

	<<say $mc>> I get the feeling, you're more personally interested in switching my gender than any way it would help me in the Abyss. I don't know know if I'd want to risk the ire of my companions for your pleasure.<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_plotting.png">> <<say $companionAI>>Well, you have my full permission to swap boddies with me!<</say>>
	You start laughing as you look down at the smartphone in your hands.

	<<say $mc>> Haha, good one Ai.<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_angry.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Stop Laughing! Is my body not good enough for you?<</say>>
	You stifle another round of laughter before you respond.

	<<say $mc>> No no, Ai, your body is beautiful but it's also very much virtual and not a physical body.<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_bummed.png">> <<say $companionAI>> ...Well. You know what, you got me there. I guess I forgot how much you flesh people care about that stuff.<</say>>
	She seems to lose herself in thought for a moment.

	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_lecturing.png">> <<say $companionAI>> On the other hand, there isn't any information in my database that says the Fate-Crossing Star can't use virtual body. Maybe it could be possible...<</say>>
	You look at her blankly for a second.

	<<say $mc>> Are you serious?<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_lecturing.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Actually... Yes.<</say>>
	<<if $app.sex=='male'>>

<<set $companionAI.name= $app.name>>
<<set $mc.name= 'Ai'>>
<</nobr>>

You open your eyes and realize your body feels undescribably strange, almost as if it weren't there at all. It takes a moment to remember slipping into that pond, but your eyes feel heavy and it's a large effort to make yourself get up. But the effort doesn't make a difference, and when your eyes are finally open you still don't see anything, as if you are blindfolded. You try to get pull off the blindfold but you can't seem to grab it. You can't even feel it on your face.

In fact, you can't even feel your arms.

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_annoyed.png">> <<say $companionAI>> What the fuck is this?<</say>>
Just as you start to wonder how your voice sounds you hear a scream. You feel as if you are moved around while simultaneously not feeling anything at all. It's very disorienting, making it hard to keep track of what's going on.

<<say $mc>> I'm real! I'm real! I'm actually real!<</say>>
Suddenly you feel youself moving even more and light finally streams into your eyes, and you see... yourself?

<<say $mc>> You actually did it! You actually did it! This is amazing, thank you so much!<</say>>
And then it dawns on you what must have happened.

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_mortified.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Oh no... Did I actually switch with you?! I didn't think it would really work.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> I know, me neither! But I'm so glad you tried! This is going to be awesome.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_shocked.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Oh my fucking... I actually lost my body? Now what am I? A virtual avatar? What the hell am I going to do? You tricked me into this!<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Slow down sister, I didn't trick you into anything. I just pondered on if it was possible and you went ahead yourself and tried it.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_crying.png">> <<say $companionAI>> I don't want this anymore, Ai. I want my body back. You stole my body, give it back.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Wow wow, don't go all panic mode on me, okay? I'm not some evil AI that wants to snatch everybody's body and take over the world. I just want to have some fun. So how about we just have some fun today, and then we'll switch back afterwards? Maybe you like all the power that comes with being a high-tech AI and we can do this more often!<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_bummed.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Okay, maybe it's not so bad to be an AI for a little bit.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_neutral_happy.png">> <<say $companionAI>> I do look pretty cute now!<</say>>
<<say $mc>> You bet your cute little rear of yours that you do!<</say>>
<<say $companionAI>> Yeah, let's just enjoy the experience and then change back tonight! Can we go back into the Fate-Crossing Star pond and switch back?<</say>>
<<say $mc>> I don't know, you're the one with the data on the Abyss now.<</say>>
<<say $companionAI>> Oh right! So how do I access this data on the Abyss...<</say>>
The moment you start thinking about the data of the Abyss, you start to remember that the Abyss has a certain origin, exits and nine layers. When you focuss your thought on the layers, you feel yourself remembering the second layer more specifcally. Remembering the second layer in turn floods your head with new memories on the threats, Relics, biome, lay-out untill you remember the wonders and start focussing on those, more specifcally the Fate-Crossing Star. You go over all the information you suddenly remembered about it.

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_shocked.png">> <<say $companionAI>>... <</say>>
<<say $mc>> Did you access the data?<</say>>
<<say $companionAI>>Yes... It only works one time.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Oh, that's inconvenient, I guess you'll be a virtual sister for a bit longer.<</say>>
She giggles, sounding strange with her mannerisms coming out of your mouth.

<<say $mc>> Anyway, where do we need to go to reverse this?<</say>>
You frantically start going through all the data, layer by layer, all Wonders, all Curses, all Relics but nothing with body swapping properties shows up.

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_mortified.png">> <<say $companionAI>>I    can't    find    anything... <</say>>
You start to feel very tired all of a sudden.

<<say $mc>> Whoa, slow down, you're overclocking the yourself quite a bit. You're draining your battery and if you're not careful you'll damage your system!<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_crying.png">> <<say $companionAI>>There has to be a way, there has to be! <</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_clueless.png">> <<say $companionAI>>Wait a second! When you proposed this, you must surely have known a way to reverse this, right Ai? <</say>>
<<say $mc>> Well, not really. You didn't ask about, so I can't remember even looking for that data<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_angry.png">> <<say $companionAI>>What do you mean I didn't ask about it? Is this a joke to you?<</say>>
Ai seems to frown as well.

<<say $mc>> Yeah, actually it sort of was. You were the person who took the joke one step further and stepped into a magical pond, remember? I didn't plan for this to happen at all, I don't have access to all the data all the time. I'm high-tech, not an omniscient god. This was not my choice nor even what I wanted to happen!<</say>>
You make yourself calm down as realize Ai is right, and you'll need her to fix this. If this is even fixable at all...

And so a new adventure starts. Although this time you are not the main character, but the sidekick. You keep sifting through the data and find that in the deepest part of the Abyss there may be a possible solution, but it would be quite the journey to get there. Ai does her best to advance in the Abyss as much as possible, but the Abyss keeps getting tougher to traverse with each layer, and her will to swap back with you wavers. 

At first Ai consulted you about which Curses she would take on, but over time she started to take more and more Curses of her own accord. Changing "your" body to that of a small, pink-haired girl. When you complained about it she brushed you off, telling you that she also needs to feel confortable in her... your body. As time went on, you felt less and less sure that you would reach the bottom of the Abyss. Moreover, would Ai even want to change back at that point?

Until then the best you can do is brief Ai on the ins and outs of the Abyss and hope her adventure reaches a conclusion you can also live with.

But unfortunately, this is no longer your story, it's hers.

:: AI ConvoL3 Wonder
	<<say $mc>> Can you give me some information on any Wonders on this layer?<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> Of course I can! There are two here, Gossamary Scale and the Skewed Shrine.<</say>>
	<<say $companionAI>> The Gossamary Scale is pretty straight forward and how you want to use it depends a bit on what you're running low on and what you have a lot at the moment.<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_sassy_talk.png">><<say $companionAI>>Although if you're really smart you try to create a situation where it would result in a lot of corruption, as that is the more valuable resource.<</say>>

:: Forbidden Grimoire Select
[img[setup.ImagePath+"Relics/forbiddengrimoire.png"]]
A grisly-looking ragged book written in an indecipherable language. Words can only be seen on the page when a person reads it alone, and they vanish as that one person reads them. This will take whatever skills the reader possesses and improve them greatly, leaving a blank, non-useful book behind. Mechanically speaking, if you let a companion use it, it would double the specific numeric benefit of their special ability - Khemia would reduce travel costs by 4 days, Cloud would redduce bullet costs by 4 (minimum 1), Cherry would reduce status effect lengths by2, and so on. (It doesn't really affect, say, Khemia's ability to slay monsters so much - he's already trained to nearly the maximum human limits, and if there's a monster he can't defeat, it's more about the monster simply being durable beyond the human body's limits than it is about any imperfections in his fighting sills.) Using it on yourself could help you in your normal life, but probably not very much on your journey - the benefit would be substantially less than that from using it on a companion, anyways. If one person were to read it twice (such as through Kin Shifter), the second use would have no benefit - best to spread it out among multiple companions.

It's useless once it's been used once of course, so choose wisely who will get the benefit.

Who do you want to give the grimoire to improve their skills?

:: Forbidden Grimoire Maru
While Maru great appreciates your gift and improves the taste of his cooking, you don't gain any material benefit on your journey from giving it to him.

:: Forbidden Grimoire Lily
After reading from the book, Lily's tongue seems just the slightest bit quicker and she sounds more convincing than ever. You now gain 20 extra dubloons when selling Relics with her on the surface.\
<<set $sellAdd += 10>>

:: Forbidden Grimoire Khemia
After reading from the book, Khemia's seems to always spot even more efficient routes than before, as if he were intuitively able to tell the best paths through the Abyss. Travel times in the Abyss are now reduced by 4 days instead of 2 while he is with you.\
<<set $timeRed += 2>>

:: Forbidden Grimoire Cherry
After reading from the book, Cherry seems to somberly ponder what she read for a few minutes, occasionally looking at her own body as if she were truly seeing it for the first time. The duration of status effects with a predetermined length is now reduced by 2 days instead of 1.\
<<set $statRed += 1>>

:: Forbidden Grimoire Cloud
After reading from the book, Cloud lines up his finger with a rock in the distance, mime's a gunshot, then turns to you and smiles. <q>I've got to test out some of the stuff I saw in there, it's crazy stuff.</q> You now have to spend 4 less bullets for any task instead of 2 less.\
<<set $bullRed += 10>>

After reading from the book, Saeko's looks a bit sad as she turns the last page, as if hoping there was more to learn. After that, she is able to use innovative techniques you've never seen before to minimzie your exposure to the miasma whenever possible. You now subtract 10 from all corruption costs in the Abyss, rather than 5.\

:: Maru Layer 1

<<say $companionMaru>>I love how pretty the flowers are here, and just look at those glowing mushrooms! I bet they're really tasty. Thanks for taking me along, this is fun.<</say>>
Maru spreads his arms and whirls in a circle. It doesn't raise your confidence in his ability to face some of the dangers that are supposedly down here, but you smile in spite of yourself. It's nice to have someone cheerful along on the journey.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 1

<<say $companionLily>>This part of the Abyss is alright, but it's not my favorite. There's just not enough going on. Yes, it's pretty, but it also gets kind of boring unless you brought along a hang-glider or a kayak.<</say>>
Lily looks at you and glances over the equipment you're carrying, sees no evidence that you brought any extreme sport equipment, and then sighs. 

<<say $companionLily>>There might be a couple Relics that are useful to you here, but in general the Relics in this part aren't that valuable. I don't know, this layer is just not really my cup of tea. If you want to hang around here, we can, but I'd rather we went somewhere with more going on. Ideally some good music. Do you know the song that goes like...<</say>>
Lily starts humming and occasionally bursts out into full blown singing. This might not be her favorite part of the Abyss, but in spite of that, she seems to be having a good time.	
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 1

Khemia is smiling and nodding as he takes in the landscape around you. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>It feels great to be back down here. This layer is pretty nice. There are some bandits who try to steal Relics from people coming back up, and supplies from people coming down, but they're not so tough. If you brought a weapon, just hand it to me, and I'll take care of them. You'd think they'd get strong stealing Relics from exhausted parties, but you'd be wrong. They're pretty incompetent and I don't think they can ever pick up any of the really strong Relics.<</say>>
Khemia's grin is infectious, and he strides forward, leaping up onto the top of a nearby rock. It's clear he's in his element here.
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 1

<<say $companionCherry>>This place is okay. It reminds me of some things I thought I'd forgotten.<</say>>
Cherry's eyes are focused out in the distance. You decide that now isn't the time to press her on what she meant.
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 1

<<say $companionCloud>>There are some people who live down on this layer who seem pretty decent. They've made a town, and are living in harmony. We've got bigger plans and responsibilities though and the real secrets of this place are further down. Let's keep moving.<</say>>
You find yourself marveling at his confident charm. Did you hire him to help with your adventure, or did you just pay him for the privilege of coming along on his?
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 1

<<say $companionSaeko>>The miasma in this layer isn't very dense, but it can concentrate under certain conditions. Some of the water has concentrated miasma in it, and there are some plants and fungi that hyper-accumulate the miasma.<</say>> 
She gestures at a glowing mushroom on the side of the path as she speaks.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Initially I thought it was a defensive mechanism, but that doesn't make sense when most of the organisms in the Abyss can tolerate miasma quite well and even incorporate it into their own life cycles. It's not my primary area of study, but perhaps someday I'll get to do some experiments on it. I'd love to understand why some species accumulate the miasma so much more than others.<</say>>
Then she suddenlt looks a little bit self conscious and starts muttering. 

<<say $companionSaeko>>Errr... sorry, sometimes I can't help myself.<</say>>
Despite her apology it's clear that she's hoping you also care about this stuff.
<br>
:: Maru Layer 2

<<say $companionMaru>>Berries!<</say>>
Maru jumps up and down with excitement at the sight of the small, sweet fruits. He seems to be loving the forest down here, since he's constantly laughing about various plants. This is certainly a grand adventure to him.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 2

<<say $companionLily>>Slippery when wet!<</say>>
 Lily shouts and laughs as she slides down a slick rock. When she lands, she smiles at you. 

 <<say $companionLily>>And down here, absolutely everything is wet.<</say>>
 She casually flicks a drop of water out of your hair, then she steps backwards and does a cartwheel over a large root jutting into the path. Unconcerned that her hands just got covered in mud, she runs them through the vegetation on either side of the narrow path you're following, cleaning them off, mostly. You pause for a second, then ask 
<<if ~($ConvoHandicapSmall || $ConvoHandicapLarge)>>\
	<<say $mc>>Who maintains this path anyway?<</say>>
	She laughs at the question for a moment before she answers. 

	<<say $companionLily>>Maintains? Nobody maintains it. There are a bunch of them down here. They're made by wandering adventurers like us, or maybe the Abyss just makes them on its own, or maybe they're just a bunch of Baying Gourmet trails.<</say>>
	You stop in your tracks, suddenly getting nervous. She looks back at you and rolls her eyes.

	<<say $companionLily>>Oh, they're out there, but there's no point in getting all scared. We're in this together. We'll face what comes, and we shall triumph!<</say>>
	She pumps her fist in the air, and expertly slides down another root, vanishing into a rustle of leaves as the path turns. You're not sure if Lily is one of the bravest people you've ever met, or just one of the craziest. You're glad you're not alone down here though.	
<</if>>\
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 2

<<say $companionKhemia>>When I first started coming down here, I just tried running over all these plants. Ha, I fell on my face a few times when my foot got snagged. There's a trick to it, winding your way through them, lopping off anything blocking the best path forward.<</say>>
He looks towards you and launches into a tale. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>There was one time when a Baying Gourmet jumped one of my party members. An on that dive, the party leader was a cheapskate who hadn't brought along a sword or any other weapons. I got lucky and dodged its claws and somehow was able to jump on its back, but the damn thing took off with me on top of it! I hung on, not wanting it to get loose and turn on me, and managed to ride it for what must have been at least a kilometer, up and down multiple trees, it was a blast. Eventually it just whimpered and laid down in the mud.<</say>>
He smiles broadly, clearly pleased at his impressive escapade.

<<say $companionKhemia>>So I left it there, but when I tracked down the rest of my party, they'd hardly moved at all! Initiative, that's the biggest thing that sets the good explorers apart from the bad ones. So don't get rattled, just do what needs to be done, and if I should get hauled away, do try to come find me.<</say>>
Khemia smirks, and continues leading the way through the thick foliage.	
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 2

<<say $companionCherry>>I like the rain down here. The mist, the plants, all of it... It's peaceful.<</say>>
The forest might strike some people as a bit unnerving, but you're glad that at least Cherry is finding some solace in it.	
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 2

<<say $companionCloud>>I think you might find a Relic on this layer that could enhance your abilities as a leader. There are some who claim that it's better to be feared than loved, but I've never agreed with that precept. If we are to make the world a better place, we must do it through love.<</say>>
The gently falling drops of water seem to bounce off Cloud's hair, and his footing never falters on the wet ground. You can't quite explain how he manages to maintain such calm poise in a jungle like this, but he does, and his presence is reassuring.	
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 2

<<say $companionSaeko>>I love this place.<</say>>
There's a look of eager wonder in Saeko's eyes as she examines the flora around you. The mist and dripping condensation remind you of a phrase you once heard: 'where there is water, there is life'. Saeko certainly seems energized by the quantity of slightly exotic biomass around you. She occasionally stoops down to take a small sample or examine one of the organisms you're passing along the journey. Every now and then she points to an insect, slug, or flower and mentions something about its genus and species or stares in wonder because she doesn't know what it is.

There is something endearing about her passionate curiosity. Sometimes it seems to you that her mind is a place of indexed facts, almost robotic in its logic, but other times the full vitality of a lively brilliance shines through her normally controlled demeanor. It's good she's excited, but you also hope her sample collecting doesn't slow you down too much.
<br>
:: Maru Layer 3

<<say $companionMaru>>You know, these dark caves aren't my favorite place. I always feel like something is going to come out of the darkness and grab me.<</say>>
His normally enthusiastic attitude has turned to muted anxiety. Maybe you shouldn't linger in the darkness of these caves for too long.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 3

<<say $companionLily>>This place is a mixed bag. One the one hand, it's so dark and gloomy that it's sure to drive you bonkers. On the other hand, the echoes are totally sweet.<</say>>
She raises her voice and sings a few notes, making the caverns send the echoes back to you, producing an oscilating set of musical chords that is both beautiful and unnerving. It's also way too loud! You look at her wide-eyed with alarm, not sure what is out there that might have just heard her in the dark. She laughs and pats you on the shoulder.

<<say $companionLily>>Don't worry, you've got me, and I'm sure we'll be fine. Might as well have a bit of fun, or you'll be bonkers in no time.<</say>>
You close your eyes briefly, thinking that the stress of her echoing voice isn't helping much, but then you breathe. Whatever comes will come. It doesn't lessen the dark and oppressive nature of the stone around you, but somehow the exchange makes you feel a little bit better about it. Lily might act carefree, but she knows what she's doing, hopefully.
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 3

<<say $companionKhemia>>They say you can't map the Abyss, and this is true, but if you come down here enough you begin to get a feel for it. You start to recognize things, like the curvature of a particular stalagmite or the patterns of the echoes. I couldn't draw you a map of these caves, but I can help you find your way through them and back out again.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 3

<<say $companionCherry>>It's very dark here. I'm not afraid of the dark or anything, but... the darkness leaves us alone in our thoughts. Stay close, this is not the kind of place we want to get lost or separated.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 3

<<say $companionCloud>>Perception and thought are the key to overcoming most obstacles. The darkness here obscures some helpful things, and some dangerous ones. Staying calm and alert will see us through any of the challenges we face here.<</say>>
Cloud smiles at you, and the darkness feels a bit less oppresive.
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 3

<<say $companionSaeko>>The macroscopic biodiversity is lower on this layer of the Abyss, but there are still some thriving fungi, a few animals, and lots of microbes. My knowledge of what is deeper down starts to get pretty scant, but this layer is still fairly well-documented. There are a few protists that I've heard form communities down here and do some fascinating things. If I only could manage to get a sample...<</say>>
She trails off, then nods her head. 

<<say $companionSaeko>>Lead on, I'll be right behind you.<</say>>
She gives you a somewhat nervous smile. You're not entirely reassured, but continue on your way through the seemingly endless caverns.
<br>
:: Maru Layer 4

Maru throws a snowball at you, laughing. 

<<say $companionMaru>>This place is fun!<</say>>
You brush some powdered snow out of your hair, and raise an eyebrow at him. Lately his cooking has been exceptional, but you're surprised how well he's holding up. Then a chill wind whistles through the pass, carrying a sense of foreboding with it. Maru looks around nervously that hurries closer to you, huddling in on himself against the cold. You force yourself to smile at him, despite your own unease and he gives a nervous smile back.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 4

A snowflake lands on a Lily's hair. She responds with an exhasperated half-smile before blowing a jet of air at it. You watch as the snowflake rejoins the wind and floats away. Normally you can't get her to stop talking, but here she's uncharacteristically quiet sometimes. The crunch of your footsteps through the snowy path is strange, like multiple little pops. Lily's thoughts seem to be mirroring your own.

<<say $companionLily>>Do you think any of this snow ever melts? I'd guess not, but if it doesn't, how deep does it go?<</say>>
There's a pause while you both worry about falling down into a 100 meter snowdrift or a hidden crevice in the ice. Then Lily seems to come back to herself, a true smile once again upon her face as she begins chattering and looks up at the icy peaks that tower above you. In this frozen landscape, she's a good friend to have.
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 4

Khemia stands atop a rock jutting out of the snow and ice peering into the distance. A chill wind whips around him, but he seems unfazed.

<<say $companionKhemia>>There's a foe that lurks on this layer that I cannot touch. Almost everything in the Abyss stays on its own layer, but not this one. It doesn't bother those of us with the purity gene, but you are in danger, and neither I nor anyone else can protect you. From here on out, it would be wise not to dither too much.<</say>>
Snow whips around both of you in this barren landscape of rock and ice. Sometimes Khemia is reassuring or awe inspiring, and sometimes he's a bit frightening. His advice is probably sound though, as you do feel like something dark is watching you more intently each day you spend here.
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 4

Cherry trudges along a bit behind you, but the snow doesn't seem to bother her. In fact, she seems to hardly notice the cold. Her breath condenses into small clouds that part around her face. She briefly meets your eyes and gives you a small smile. You're not sure how she conveys so much with a simple expression, but you sense that she's more at peace down here, trudging through the snow, then she has been in some time.
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 4

<<say $companionCloud>>The glaciers here tell a story, a tale of countless snows beyond measure. This place has never known the warmth of spring. In some ways it is akin to the world above; harsh, unforgiving, where life is a struggle for most, and even those who aren't struggling are afraid that they might fall, and struggle again. I do not know what force makes this layer of the Abyss the way it is, but my instincts tell me that one who could bring peace and prosperity to a place like this, could also heal the world above.<</say>>
Cloud stares out at the frozen peaks and deep chasms in this frigid place. 

<<say $companionCloud>>Could one with a sufficiently warm heart thaw even this ice, or would the attempt merely freeze their heart? There is power in the cold, but it is not kind, and is ill-suited for bringing joy to anyone.<</say>>
Normally Cloud radiates confidence, but here he seems wistful, or even worried. His reveries are probably not useful to the task at hand though, and after a few more moments he returns to walking. Deep truths will wait for now, there are Relics to find and places to go.
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 4

<<say $companionSaeko>>Negative fourteen degrees C.<</say>>
Saeko sighs, apparently measuring the temperature once again, as you have seen her do many times while here.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I don't understand it. No matter where we go in this layer, it's negative fourteen degrees C. It's like there's some giant thermostat carefully maintaining the temperature. Even if I insulate the thermostat, it read negative fourteen degrees C.<</say>>
She shakes her head. 

<<say $companionSaeko>>The algae in these glaciers have processed the miasma in such a way that they make things ingesting them bigger or smaller, but why, and how? Where does the mass even come from? Where does it go?<</say>>
Saeko is apparently frustrated, but then a spark comes into her eyes.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Ah, unrelated, but I have a hypothesis to test. The drifting swallowers on this layer, big floaty things that try to eat you, some previous researchers thought they used hydrogen or helium to keep themselves afloat, but I think it's simpler than that. I think they're just heating the air in the gasseous sacks with their body temperature. I bet they've got blood vessels that contract and expand around those sacks to regulate how buoyant they are by the temperature of the air inside them, and thus how much they expand. It's just like a hot air balloon, only... they try to eat you. There might be a way to use that to our advantage.<</say>>
<br>
:: Maru Layer 5

<<say $companionMaru>>Flowers and sand!<</say>>
Maru is shouting.

<<say $companionMaru>>Sand and flowers, Flowers and Sand. Everything is flowers and sand.<</say>>
You find yourself agreeing with him. His outburst might not be especially insightful, but you understand his exasperation. At first this flowery sandy desert was a lot of fun to walk through but now it's just tiring. All the flowers start to look the same after a while, and all the petals that blow across the dunes are dry. Every now and then interesting rocky outcroppings peak out of the sand, but for the most part, in spite of the flowers, the terrain is painfully monotonous. Here you are, in the middle of this vast plain of sand beneath a bright "sky" that seems like it shouldn't be there... You're pretty sure you're actually beneath the planet's crust right now, aren't you? What exactly is going on here?
<br>
:: Lily Layer 5

<<say $companionLily>>Okay, I'm officially tired of walking through all this sand. I'm tired of these stupid flowers too.<</say>>
Lily spits out a petal that floated into her mouth as she complains.

<<say $companionLily>>Look, I get it, we've got to keep moving, but seriously we should figure out how to ride one of those Dune Devouring Borers, because they seem like they can move way faster.<</say>>
You give Lily a meaningful look, but she doesn't relent.

<<say $companionLily>>No, I'm serious, it would be fun, and efficient; it's a good idea.<</say>>
You'll have to think about how you might attempt such a thing the next time a Dune Devouring Borer attacks your party, but it doesn't seem like something you'd be able to do easily.

:: Khemia Layer 5

<<say $companionKhemia>>This is as deep as I've ever gone in past dives. The desert is huge, and often deadly and the Relics are often hidden in trapped passages and tombs. Most explorer parties that venture into the Abyss turn back before this point, and many that make it this far make it back up.<</say>>
Khemia sighs as he looks out at the landscape of unforgiving sands.

<<say $companionKhemia>>I once accompanied a man named Phillip, he was a pretty good leader, but this desert was the death of him.<</say>>
Khemia gestures around at the scorching, inhospitable sands, then gives you a very direct look.

<<say $companionKhemia>>The most important part of my job is to try to get you back out of this place alive. Make sure you have enough supplies, and if you get hurt, use a medkit. If something goes badly wrong, consider settling rather than dying. This desert has its own kind of peace, and even though it's not where I'd want to spend the rest of my life, it's better than losing the rest of your life to death.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 5

<<say $companionCherry>>It's too bright here<</say>>
Cherry squints against the light as she complains.

<<say $companionCherry>>That's not even really the sun. Ugh... nevermind, it's not important. Let's just keep going.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 5

<<say $companionCloud>>A trillion petals fly across this desert made of dreams, but now we're far beneath the earth and naught is what it seems. We must swim across this ocean of slow moving waves of sand, to find some precious Relics that can help restore our land. Threats rise up to greet us for they know not why we've come, but none can stand against us beneath this artificial sun.<</say>>
Cloud sighs deeply, breathing in the dry desert air.

<<say $companionCloud>>Sometimes words help us, but not always. This journey has brought us far, let us make it worth the trip.<</say>>
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 5

<<say $companionSaeko>>How are there all these flowers with so little water? Normal flowers are extremely delicate, the petals are turgid with water pressure, the process of pollination and seed development is extremely vulnerable to drought-like conditions, the anthers and stigma require sufficient water for the process to work. These flowers though, they're everywhere, but they don't actually have any reproductive organs on them. They're not doing what flowers are supposed to do. On top of that, they're practically anhydrous.<</say>>
Saeko runs her fingers through her hair as she paces back and forth.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I don't get it. I've taken careful notes, and the physiology indicates there are at least 17 species of these flowers down here, really just flowers, slender stalks supporting petals with no roots to speak of, and they're clearly reproducing like mad, but there's no water in them, and they're not even engaging in any kind of reproduction I understand. Are they vegetatively propagating? Are the petals themselves a means of tissue separation and dispersal? I've heard there might be a research facility in this vast desert somewhere, have they figured out what's going on here?<</say>>
She seems to mostly be talking to herself, but eventually her eyes lock on yours.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I don't know how these pseudo-flowers are doing what they're doing, but you and I, we need water. Our cells are full of water, they only work because they're full of water. You're the leader here. Make sure we've got enough water, and for goodness sake, do not let us get eaten by one of those giant worms.<</say>>
<br>
:: Maru Layer 6

<<say $companionMaru>>No, nonono, I said NO you stupid tentacle!<</say>>
Maru shouts, repeatedly kicking at one of the many tentacles that keeps trying to climb up his skirt. You look back at him with some sympathy. Not far away you can see the river Dycx, and you hear the rumbling of a flock of Omen Eyes. Every now and then you have come across a deep pit that curves down under the land. Even the walls of those pits have been lined in tentacles. Eventually Maru stops attacking the tentacle and rushes to catch up with you.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 6

<<say $companionLily>>Well this is different.<</say>>
Lily speaks with a rye smile on her face.

<<say $companionLily>>I'd heard a couple stories, but I've never actually talked with anyone who's gone this deep before. To think, hell is just full of a bunch of perverted tentacles. It's quite a sight to...<</say>>
She brushes another questing tentacle away from her thigh...

<<say $companionLily>>Feel.<</say>>
She rolls her eyes, then looks into the distance at a great roaring fire that's searing part of the vast tentacle fields a kilometer away.

<<say $companionLily>>Let's also try to avoid getting burned. This place is super weird, but hey, sometimes you've just gotta roll with it.<</say>>
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 6

Khemia has been acting strangely ever since you got here. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>Wow, I still can't believe we've actually made it. I've heard stories, but... I finally got a leader with the ambition and ability to plunge this deep. It's exciting.<</say>>
He grins at you, but then his expression becomes a bit more uncertain.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's also a bit much at first. All the earlier layers I've had experience on, but this place is weirder than I thought it would be.<</say>>
His eyes seem to gain a glint as he looks at the surroundings.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Don't worry though, we've got this. The same skills that brought us this far will see us through whatever we face next. I do think we should be careful about spending too much time here unless we can find some way to deal with these tentacles though. The ones burning with multicolored flames seem pretty sinister.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 6

Cherry looks around skeptically at the endless fields of writhing tentacles, and burning tentacles, and slowly shifting infernos that leave behind only ash. She sighs.

<<say $companionCherry>>Lead the way.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 6

A calculating look comes over Cloud's face as he whispers.

<<say $companionCloud>>Here there be dragons.<</say>>
He glances acorss the landscape and seems to take it in. 

<<say $companionCloud>>It's not enough though. There are powerful Relics here in this disturbing place, but I think we'd need to go deeper. We'll also need to find a way to deal with some of the hexed magic we're already being exposed to. If we don't, the longer we stay here the more it will slow us down, and it will be unpleasant to boot.<</say>>
He gives you a very direct look.

<<say $companionCloud>>Unless you're super fond of tentacles, we need to get back to the surface, and we need to survive the attempt. Don't forget our purpose, and don't underestimate the danger, but I can feel it in my bones that there's something important deeper down.<</say>>
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 6

Saeko shies away from a particularly vigorous tentacle in the path and shakes her head.

<<say $companionSaeko>>This is very weird.<</say>>
You look at her in surprise. Normally Saeko is full of detailed observations and theories, but not today. You ask her what's wrong, and she just shakes her head again.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Look, I don't have an explanation for burning fields of tentacles. I thought the tentacle beasts we saw earlier might have been related to surface cephalopods, but now that seems much less likely. They probably share some common ancestor with these... field tentacles, but I have no idea what that would be. And I really don't like walking around this infernal place that doesn't even have a single plant, but I'll do my best to keep us protected from the effects of the miasma while we're down here. I'm just going to focus on that for right now.<</say>>
<br>
:: Maru Layer 7

<<say $companionMaru>>I almost like this place, but with all this advanced technology, all they have are the same barely-edible vending machine rations. It's really not much to work with.<</say>>
Maru shakes his head, looking indignant at the cullinary limitations of this city.

<<say $companionMaru>>I'll tell you, robots just don't appreciate good food. Whoever built them must have given up and left out of sheer boredom from eating these same terrible rations day in and day out. There are no mushrooms, no berries, not even a rat. What kind of a city doesn't even have rats?<</say>>
<br>
:: Lily Layer 7

Lily looks quizically at the city around you.

<<say $companionLily>>It just seems silly, you know? Why all these buildings? Why are there these jobs? What are all these robots even doing? Taxes? Taxes in the Abyss? It just seems so ridiculous.<</say>>
You give her a sideways smile, she does have a point, but she's not done... alas, Lily is never, ever done talking.

<<say $companionLily>>Why on earth do robots need houses? Couldn't they all just power down and be content? Now mind you, I've never been a robot, and I don't think I'd want to be one, because being a robot sounds insufferably boring, but if I were a robot, I'd have a hard time rationalizing my programming that was telling me to do all these ridiculous things that make no sense. Move rocks around? Paint stuff? You're a robot, just program yourself to be satisfied with the way things are. Unless... do you think it's the Abyss that's programming them somehow? Wait, I have an idea, we could program them to play music. I don't know how to do that, but it would be super fun. Do you have any Relics that could make all these silly robots sing a song together? No? Ah... that's okay.<</say>>
The monologue never ends...
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 7

Khemia looks a bit shaken.

<<say $companionKhemia>>This place... I've never even imagined anything like this.<</say>>
He looks down at his hands and almost seems to tremble for a moment.

<<say $companionKhemia>>What good is swordsmanship against limitless armies of metal machines?<</say>>
You try to cheer him up a bit, but he just shakes his head.

<<say $companionKhemia>>There's some impressive stuff here, but to me, this all just feels a bit wrong. I thought I knew what the Abyss was about, but the deeper we go, the less sure I am.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 7

<<say $companionCherry>>It's frozen.<</say>>

<<if ~($ConvoHandicapSmall || $ConvoHandicapLarge)>>\
	<<say $mc>>What?<</say>>
<<else>>\
	You try to make clear you don't understand what she means.
<</if>>\

<<say $companionCherry>>This place. It looks alive, but it isn't. All these robots, they move, but they're also frozen. Everything here is waiting, waiting for a day that will never come.<</say>>

Her tone is hollow, but this is more than Cherry usually says. Somehow, deep down, you know that she has spoken a truth.
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 7

<<say $companionCloud>>Yes, this is the place. But, where are they? The ones who designed and created this, where have they gone? Their machines still whir about, but... could it be that they are no more?<</say>>
Cloud is unusually agitated, still in command of himself, but not exactly calm.

<<say $companionCloud>>Regardless, the technology here, the power here, this could change the world. Between the Relics on this layer and the ones on the upper layers, it's possible for us to do something big. Let's gather what we can.<</say>>
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 7

<<say $companionSaeko>>To think, this has been down here, all this technology, all this power, and we didn't even know. How long has it been like this? Is this an evolving robotic society, or just... no, it doesn't seem like it. These systems, they lack something vital about them. They're artificial, not organic.<</say>>
You ask her how she knows. She gives you a faint smile.

<<say $companionSaeko>>It's just a hypothesis, I don't have the experimental data I'd really need to justify that conclusion, but just look at the robots. They're mass produced, you can tell. Look at how they move. Those movements are a result of programming, not a biological intelligence that's making subtle mistakes and correcting them. Have you ever really watched a colony of ants? Ants are pretty alien to us, their thinking is strange, their movements are strange, but even ants display far more characteristics of life in their actions that any of these robots do. Ant brains are simple, but they still think. It's different from calculation. These robots, none that I've seen seem to be displaying indications of actual thought.<</say>>
<br>
:: Maru Layer 8

<<say $companionMaru>>I feel like we're at a tea party inside a doll house, but that the person throwing the tea party isn't very nice.<</say>>
You look over at Maru, he's dealing with all of this better than you'd have expected.

<<say $companionMaru>>My sisters used to have tea parties with me when I was young, they taught me how to make crumpets and scones, they gave me lessons on properly preparing the tea, and manners... I really miss them. Being down here, it reminds me of all the fun we had. They were really nice. They weren't perfect or anything, everyone has flaws, but they tried to be nice. I think that whoever is throwing this tea party doesn't understand kindness or love. Still, we're down here together, I'll do my best to make up for what they were missing.<</say>>
<br>
:: Lily Layer 8

<<say $companionLily>>I've got to tell you, when we first came down here I thought that all this crazy space-warping architecture would drive me nuts. However, I'm starting to like it. Oh, don't get me wrong, this place is totally screwed up, creepy puppet things lurking around corners, weird nightmares, endless hallways of rooms that are all just a bit too eerie, but you know, it's also kind of fun. Sure this place is all messed up, but it's our adventure. I've never heard of anyone who actually came down this far before, and as explorers, we're pretty cool.<</say>>
Lily puffs out her chest and strikes a pose of supreme confidence then gets a mischevious grin on her face.

<<say $companionLily>>Do you think that we never hear about people coming this deep because their balloons don't reach the surface, and nobody who comes this deep is able to return alive?<</say>>
Despite her joking tone, you get a slight chill down your spine. This unnerving place has been giving you that impression the whole time you've been on this layer, but Lily laughs.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh relax. We'll get out of here, and then they're going to tell stories about us for ages. The team that cracked the 8th seal, $app.name and Lily, the paladins of doom and their journey beyond time and space. Okay, maybe that's a bit overly dramatic, but we're making history here. Keep your chin up, and stay stylish, we've got this.<</say>>
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 8

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, these doll things that keep following us are easy to take down, but their movements are weird. I wonder how many of them there are in this place, and what they even are. Where do they come from?<</say>>
He's looking a bit more confident than he did back on layer 7, but he's still clearly a bit on edge. He smiles. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's strange, I love exploring, adventure, combat, all this stuff. I'm the most experienced companion in the entire guild, but I feel a little torn about this place now that we're so deep. Since we came down into this labyrinth of stairways and empty rooms, I've had this prickle on the back of my neck. There's something about this place that's very dangerous, and I love it, I love the creepy adventure of it all, but at the same time, I'm not quite sure I can handle it.<</say>>
Khemia peeks his head around a hallway corner, checking for danger.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's like this violin is holding one high note the whole time we're down here, and I can't decide if I'm in love with this layer, or if I hate it. Every time we turn a corner I'm expecting something horrific to happen. Am I going crazy?<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 8

<<say $companionCherry>>Games... do you ever wonder why we play their games?<</say>>
You look at Cherry quizically, and she stares back blankly.

<<say $companionCherry>>I mean it's obvious, right? Everything here is a puppet. Nothing here is entirely real, it's all a game.<</say>>
You still don't understand what she means. She sighs.

<<say $companionCherry>>I just can't help but wonder if we're not puppets too. Is there something out there, pulling on our strings, forcing us to do these things? Nothing down here makes sense, except that.<</say>>
Then she is silent, and just trails along after you as you proceed along yet another uncanny corridor.
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 8

Cloud appears somewhat distressed.

<<say $companionCloud>>This place... it should not be.<</say>>
He looks at you intensely.

<<say $companionCloud>>Can't you feel it? There's something very wrong here. These endless stairs to nowhere, these passages, the weird dolls, the food, the water, everything is just... wrong.<</say>>
Part of you isn't sure what he's talking about, because everything in the Abyss has felt kind of wrong to you, though not always in a bad way. Another part of you resonates strongly with what he said though. There is something deeply unnerving about this layer that's different from the ones before it.
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 8

<<say $companionSaeko>>Okay, I'm trying not to freak out, but this place is unnerving. Physics isn't working properly here. That in and of itself should be very alarming. The "food" and "water" both seem to have neuro-degenerative effects, which personally terrifies me. And when I look at surfaces through my microscope, do you know what I see?<</say>>
You shake your head, unaware of her observations.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Nothing! No fungal spores, no bacteria, no tiny insects, nothing. I can do my best to keep us protected, but even my best efforts aren't really enough. This place should not exist. We probably shouldn't be here. These animated doll-like things just aren't right. I saw one of them earlier that looked just like you, but it was wrong and I knew it wasn't anything like you. I'm afraid here, and you should be too.<</say>>
<br>

:: LilyConvoLac Rep
<<say $companionLily>>Come here sweety, it's time to drink up again.<</say>>
Without protesting you go to Lily. She sits down and bares her breast, exposing her enticing nipple for you. You lay your head in her lap and take her nipple in your mouth, then begin to gently suck.

<<say $companionLily>>Drink as much as you can, so can become big and strong.<</say>>
Lily whispers softly to you, in a way that makes it seems she's really getting into this fantasy. You suckle her sweat breastmilk while she runs he hand through your hair lovingly.

<<say $companionLily>>Well, maybe don't become <i>too</i> big and strong.<</say>>
She giggles as you continue to drink your fill, her nourishing milk flowing freely through your lips. 

:: CherryConvoLac Rep
Cherry is hovering around you again, as if she is anticipating something. The fact she is actually approaching you likely means something, and you suspect you know what it is.

<<if ~($ConvoHandicapSmall || $ConvoHandicapLarge)>>\
	<<say $mc>>Give me a moment.<</say>>
<<else>>\
	You smile gently and nod to her, giving a signal to get closer to you.
<</if>>\
You pull out a dish and fill it with your breastmilk, then present it to her.

<<if ~($ConvoHandicapSmall || $ConvoHandicapLarge)>>\
	<<say $mc>>Here, kitty!<</say>>
<<else>>\
	You whistle to get her attention and she slowly approaches.
<</if>>\
Cherry seems happy to come over to you, or at least it seems a little less like a chore than everything else she does. She brushes up against you as she approaches the plate. You pet her head and run your hands through her hair while she laps it up.
<<set $companionCherry.affec +=1>><br>

:: CloudConvoLac Rep
<<say $companionCloud>>You're leaking again.<</say>>
Cloud speaks matter-of-factly, a simple statement of fact. But he follows through on those implications as he approaches you. You look down to check your clothes, but Cloud is already helping you out of them. He bends you over while he sits on his knees beside you.

<<say $companionCloud>>Just relax, I know you enjoy these sessions. Sometimes, it's good to relax and let things flow. Let me take control here.<</say>>
You can hardly argue with him as he begins to massage your breasts. The gentle sensation spreads a wave of relief through your body as it clears you of your stockpile of milk. You feel the pressure in your chest alleviated as his massage squeezes the liquid from your breasts.

<<say $companionCloud>>Who's a good <<PerceivedStature>> <<PerceivedGender>>?<</say>>
<<say $mc>> <<if $IQdrop>20>>Mooooo!<<else>>Hmmmmm!<</if>><</say>>
You can't think of much else to say, but you continue to enjoy the sensations.
<<set $companionCloud.affec +=1>><br>
