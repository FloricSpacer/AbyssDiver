Maru cheerfully brings you a meal he made, checking to see if it is as satisfying as he hopes it is.

:: Maru Convo1 Childhood
<<set $companionMaru.affec+=(1+$hsswear)>>\
<<say $mc>>Could you tell me something about your<<if $IQdrop >15>>, like,<</if>> childhood?<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>> Well, I was mostly raised by my big sister. She was nice, but not exactly the most gentle person ever. Maybe overprotective would be a better way to describe it. When I was younger I wasn't really allowed to play outside or do anything that might be too rough. Sometimes it was a little annoying, but I understand why she was doing it.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>I can <<if $IQdrop >15>>you know, totally <</if>>imagine that was a little tough.<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>>Yeah, but it wasn't all bad. I think she was just looking out for me, since I am the youngest. We were a very tight family, so we did a lot of stuff with each other. And in a way it forced me to learn to cook and sow as well, since I wanted to do things with my sister.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Is that also the reason why you are wearing <<if $IQdrop >20>>, like super duper<</if>> feminine clothing? Were they<<if $IQdrop >10>>, like,<</if>> forcing you to do this?<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>> No! No, nothing like that. As a child I think I looked pretty feminine.  Well, even more than now I mean. My sisters liked to play dress-up with me, and I actually liked it too. Sometimes I thought that I shouldn't be doing it, but eventually I realized that if it makes me happy, then there's no reason I should stop.<</say>>
He pauses for a moment as he seems to gather his thoughts.

<<say $companionMaru>> Over time I really began to appreciate how well my sisters cared for me. I don't know if it's the same for everyone, but I was glad they accepted what I liked and we could do things together and be happy.<</say>>
You ponder his story for a bit.

<<say $mc>> Thanks for<<if $IQdrop >20>>, like,<</if>> sharing that with me. How are your sisters doing?<</say>>
His expression falls, and he looks down in silence for a few seconds before responding. 

<<say $companionMaru>>They all left.<</say>>
After a few more moments he forces a smile and continues. 

<<say $companionMaru>> Anyway, don't let your meal get cold!<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Oh, sure, thanks for the <<if $IQdrop >15>>totally yummy <</if>>meal!<</say>>
As you take in the food, you realize it takes shockingly good for something made with such limited ingredients. How did he manage to get the texture just right and the flavors perfectly balanced all the way down here? Maru giggles as he looks at you eating his food.

<<say $companionMaru>> Well, if you like it this much, I'll be sure to make it like this more often!<</say>>

Maru almost chokes on his food and starts nervously stammering.

<<say $mc>>Like it? It's absolutely delicious!<</say>>
Maru smiles widely at your comment.

<<say $companionMaru>> Well, in that case it would be cruel for me to not tell you the recipe! Even if it is made from the limited ingredients we have with us here!<</say>>
Maru tells you in detail how he prepared the dish. It's actually pretty simple, but he added some herbs with subtle flavors which seem to have a made a big difference in the final product. And his cooking method was precise to ensure the texture ended up perfect!

:: Maru Wetting
<<say $mc>>You seemed to be making the most of the delay I caused earlier.<</say>>
A light blush tinges your cheeks as you recall the damp, urine-soaked bedding that caused the delay.

<<say $companionMaru>>Yeah, I've been thinking about your, um, predicament. I think I have a solution.<</say>>
Your eyes widen in surprise.

<<say $mc>> Oh? And what might that be?<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>>Behold! Ta-da!<</say>>
Maru beams with pride as he pulls something from his belongings. It appears to be a pair of underwear, but noticeably bulkier.

<<say $mc>> Underwear?<</say>>
<<if $app.appAge < 12>>\
	<<say $companionMaru>>Not exactly, it's actually a diaper. I made it from clothes I no longer needed. Despite being made of cloth, it's super absorbent! Perfect for someone like you!<</say>>

Maru appears slightly disheartened.

<<if $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Lily")>>\

	A tense silence fills the space, and Maru's cheeks flush a rosy hue.
	<<say $companionLily>>What's this?<</say>>
	As she speaks, Lily snatches the 'protective underwear' from Maru's grasp. She scrutinizes it and glances at you. A mischievous grin spreads across her face.

	<<say $companionLily>>Ah, I understand. This is for your little 'issue,' $app.name, isn't it?<</say>>

	<<say $mc>>Yes, Maru made it, but I just told him I'll handle it myself.<</say>>

		Unable to summon the courage to decline Lily again, you relent.

		<<say $mc>>You're probably right, Lily<</say>>
		You take the cloth diaper from her hands and move to a secluded spot to put it on. As anticipated, it feels bulky between your legs, causing an awkward waddle. You return to Lily and Maru.
	
		<<say $companionLily>>Oh my, you look absolutely adorable, you know that!<</say>>
		As she speaks, she tugs your clothes aside to reveal the cloth diaper. She pats it approvingly a few times.
	
		<<say $companionLily>>Wow, it looks fantastic on you and fits so snugly. Maru, I'm genuinely impressed that you made this here. How did you manage that?<</say>>
		Maru's face beams with pride upon hearing the praise.

		<<say $companionMaru>>I just used cloth scraps and my sewing kit!<</say>>
		<<say $companionLily>>Maru, you must be an incredibly talented tailor! You'll have to make something for me too – not a diaper, of course – but I have some ideas for a dress...<</say>>

	<<else>>\
		<<say $mc>>I appreciate your concern, Lily, but I can handle it. Don't worry.<</say>>
		<<say $companionLily>>Well, if you insist.<</say>>
		Lily continues to examine the cloth diaper, still in her possession.

		<<say $companionLily>>It looks as if it's straight from a store, even up close. Maru, you really made this?<</say>>
		<<say $companionMaru>>Yes, I just used cloth scraps and my sewing kit!<</say>>
		<<say $companionLily>>Remarkable! You have to make something for me too – not a diaper, of course – but I have some ideas for a dress...<</say>>

:: Maru Wetting Accepted 
<<say $mc>> Thank you, this is really thoughtful. I hope it will help me.<</say>>
You accept the cloth diaper with a hint of reluctance, unsure of how to feel. Maru's eyes twinkle with anticipation as they watch you, and a brief but palpable silence fills the air between you both.

<<say $companionMaru>> Um, perhaps you could try it on. If it doesn't fit snugly, it won't be much help, you know.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Oh yes, of course.<</say>>
You take the cloth diaper from Maru's hands and find a secluded spot to put it on. As expected, the fabric feels bulky between your legs, resulting in a slightly awkward waddle. You return to Maru, who meticulously inspects the edges of the diaper upon your arrival.

<<say $companionMaru>> I think I managed to get your measurements right! It seems to fit quite well!<</say>>
Grateful, you thank Maru once more and decide to carry on with your journey, now equipped with a little extra padding for comfort.

<<say $mc>>Hey! Yeah, I'm $mc.name, and I'm<<if $IQdrop >10>>, like,<</if>> so happy that you're joining our team!<</say>>
She releases her grip on you and smiles widely.

<<say $companionLily>>I didn't expect such a warm welcome, but hey I'm not complaining! Especially from such a cute <<PerceivedGender $app>>.<</say>>
She winks at you and grins as she finishes her comment. You weren't sure if you were going for the cute vibe, but at the very least you want to be taken seriously as an adventurer. On the other hand, you suppose it's good that your new teammate likes you.

You wink back to her <<if $IQdrop >10>>and giggle <</if>>and Lily seems to give you a sly smile in return.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh my, we only just met and you already know what to say to get my engine running!<</say>>
Lily steps forward to approach you, and it almost seems like she's leaning in for a kiss. But before you can react, you suddenly feel a hard pat on your back and open your eyes to see Lily with the widest grin possible on her face.

<<say $companionLily>>But let's not jump the gun here <<mrms>> cassanova. We have a whole adventure ahead of us to get to know each other better.<</say>>

She starts snicker at her own joke. You're not quite sure if it's a joke at your expense, but she doesn't seem to clarify. Regardless, she seems to be in good spirits and that's what's important in the end, right?

You close your eyes and move your face close to kiss her. But as your face approached hers, your cheeks are suddenly grabbed with suprising strength as Lily pushes you back with an annoyed scoff.

<<say $companionLily>>There is something to be said about being so forward... But there's also something about not reading signals correctly, right?<</say>>
Flustered, you find yourself at a loss for words and don't manage to find a response quickly enough.

<<say $mc>>I'm so sorry... I<<if $IQdrop >15>>,like totally,<</if>> just thought that... You know...<</say>>
Lily sighs deeply and her face lightens up a little bit as she raises her eyebrows.

<<say $companionLily>>Yeah, maybe I do know? Well, I guess I am an awfully cute little angel, right?<</say>>
She frames her face between her hands as she gives you a sly smile once again.

Lily grins, straightens her back, and puts on a mock formal voice.

<<say $companionLily>>Well thank you for asking <<mrms>> boss <<PerceivedGender $app>>. My hobbies include listening to pop music and traveling. I've traveled to lots of the countries around this world already! What can I say? I guess I'm just the adventurous type. <</say>>

Before you can finish your sentence, she interrupts you.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh, and anime too! The best thing is if I can combine both! I once travelled half way around the world for this awesome anime convention. You wouldn't believe the cute little snacks they had over there. Sometimes I wish I could go back, but in my life I prefer to always move forward and not get fixated on the past. Oh, but there was this other time where...<</say>>
In the end Lily rambles on for quite a while about her various travels, what anime see likes, what songs she like, and what anime songs she likes. Even if you can't quite follow all of her stories or don't know much about the places she mentions, she seems happy as long as you make an effort and nod along.

Lily looks you over with a raised eyebrow after which a smile quickly forms on her face.

She pokes you in your sides playfully as she talks.

<<say $companionLily>>So tell me more about yourself. What do you like? Do you do these kinds of expeditions often? I always really love going on new adventures and exploring!<</say>>
You talk for quite some time afterwards. She is actually quite attentive and interested in what you have to say, although she does tend to go on a rambling streak from time to time when you give her the chance.

She playfully wets a finger with her mouth and sticks it in your ear. You jump from the unpleasant sensation as Lily bursts into laughter.

<<say $mc>>What the hell, Lily! I thought we were having a serious conversation.<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>Haha, you must have misheard me. I love to travel, even more than you probably know.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>But I thought you just said...<</say>>
Lily dismisses your confusion with a wave of her hand.

<<say $companionLily>>Yeah, yeah, I get it. I love to travel all the time, so I can't have a family. And I'd like to have a family, so I can't travel all the time. It's just, I'm not good at not getting what I want, and I want both of those things!<</say>>
She looks up with a smile.

<<say $mc>>What's the problem with having a family?<</say>>
Lily lets out a heavy sigh, her delicate shoulders rising and falling.

<<say $companionLily>>I was afraid you wouldn't understand...<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Did I say something wrong?<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>No, no, it's just... I thought by now you knew I was sent from the heavens, and someday I'll have to return there.<</say>>
Lily gives a playful pout, placing her hands beneath her chin.

<<say $mc>>Ah yes, of course. How could I forget? You're a fallen angel, with more important things to attend to than starting a family.<</say>>
She playfully taps your nose as she makes a buzzing sound.

<<say $companionLily>>Wrong! I don't have more important things to do. The people around me will be important, but it can't be the only thing in my life. What if it gets boring? I don't want to have friends or a family and then feel unhappy because they're holding me back from discovering more about myself or the world.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Hmm, I think I understand. You want to travel and start a family, but you're worried about finding the balance between the two.<</say>>
She taps your nose again and repeats the buzzing sound.

<<say $companionLily>>Wrong again! I'm not worried and I never said I thought I couldn't find a balance. I just haven't figured it out yet. I know I'll get everything I want in the end, I just have to keep working towards it. In the meantime, I'll settle for having you as my surrogate family as we go on all these exciting adventures in the Abyss!<</say>>
She sticks out her tongue and continues on her way, a twinkle in her eye.

<<say $mc>>A family sounds a bit dull, to be honest. I'd rather stick to the adventures of the road!<</say>>
Lily rolls her eyes.

<<say $companionLily>>Yeah, great story <<if $app.sex == "male">>bro<<else>>sis<</if>>. How many meatheads and traveling bimbos have told me that over the years? It gets tiring, and to be honest, it's a bit sad to hear.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>But isn't it kind of true? You experience something new every day while traveling.<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>I'll give you a pass on that one, since traveling the Abyss is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience for most. But I've heard that same line so many times before. People go to the same type of bars and do the same things for years, just with different people every once in a while. That's not discovering new experiences, that's just being lonely and pretending otherwise. I bet many people with families experience more new things in the end.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Okay, so start a family then and experience those things.<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>You still don't get it. I don't think travel is stupid, not the real travel, the kind where you go to truly new places and experience truly new things. I could never, and I mean never, give that up. You see, I want both! To have a social circle and a family, but also to travel the worlds indefinitely.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>World, singular.<</say>>
Lily rolls her eyes again and lets out another sigh.

<<say $companionLily>>Seriously, could you be any more square right now?<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Sorry, Lily. I'm just trying to wrap my head around it. So you want to have a family and friends around you all the time, but also travel the world indefinitely?<</say>>
Lily gives you a sweet peck on the cheek.

<<say $companionLily>>See, you do get it. With enough help from me, of course. I just need to figure out how to make it all work. In the meantime, I'll settle for having you as my surrogate family as we go on all these exciting adventures in the Abyss!<</say>>

The moment she hears you speak, Lily makes a high pitched squeak and jumps up, startled. She then drops the World Stone she was holding.

<<say $mc>>Oh, sounds like you really keep yourself in shape then!<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>Yeah, I put on some loud music and just work up a good sweat. How else do you think I keep this angelic body?<</say>>
She puffs out her chest a bit and gestures widely over her whole body.

<<say $companionLily>>Anyway, not to say that this whole journey is not a good workout on its own, buuut... When I saw the World Stone, I started wondering if it could be even better. This could be a golden opportunity to get in better shape than ever before!<</say>>

When you glance at Lily's wet blouse, she catches you staring at her. She cocks an eyebrow at you and frowns.

<<say $companionLily>>Yeah, that's right. This is your doing, isn't it?<</say>>
<<say $mc>>I... uh... I'm sorry, Lily...<</say>>
You look down, slightly ashamed at the obvious contempt she is showing you.

	Lily stretches her arms to pick up your diminutive body.

	<<say $companionLily>>Of course sweety. If you really don't want this, I'll get dressed again and we'll just continue as expedition partners. Or...<</say>>

<<say $companionLily>>I...<</say>>
It actually happened. Lily is actually at a loss for words. Although you'd typically make light of the situation, you actually feel bad for her right now.

<<say $companionLily>>Ssssshh<</say>>
She gently presses a finger against your lips, silencing your protest.

<<say $companionLily>>It's okay, mommy does know, even if you don't.<</say>>
And with that definitive statement, she pulls her bra down, revealing her perfect breasts, one of which already has a single bead of milk dangling from the nipple.

<<say $companionLily>>Come here, sweety.<</say>>
She pushes your head against the nipple of her breast. You put up something of a weak struggle, as you don't want to hurt her, but you're willing to go along with her at this point. Her strong arms don't move an inch.

<<say $companionLily>>Don't fight it, just help mommy. Do it for me, okay?<</say>>
Resigned, you latch on and start sucking a little. You taste something sweet. In your curiosity, you suck slightly harder so that more of the sweet milky flavor invades your mouth. It isn't as bad as you would have expected and within a few moments you settle into a steady rhythm of suckling.

<<say $companionLily>>Very good, I'm so proud on you.<</say>>
Lily lets out a soft moan and firmly holds your head to her breast.

He puffs up his chest a little bit and smiles.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, I don't mean to brag, but I did almost beat a Dune Devouring Borer once. It was a shame I broke my sword on its rock-hard hide, but I was almost able to subdue it anyway. I swear if I had a stronger weapon then I could have even killed the beast!<</say>>

He suddenly cuts you off before you're able to finish your thought.

<<say $companionKhemia>>And once, we were running low on supplies and  everybody thought they were done for. Things were getting really desperate and the main diver was even saying some prayers, like he didn't think we were gonna make it. But I led them through a cave complex I'd known from a previous dive, showed them a shortcut to a nice foraging spot and a quicker path back up to the surface. By the time we were back to the surface we even had a few days of supplies to spare! <</say>>

You pause for a moment, taking stock of where you are. Looking back, you notice that Khemia has picked up a stick and appears to be performing some kind of sword kata. You watch him, fascinated by his movements. The way he darts and spins, always keeping his balance over where he is, or where he's going to be. He flows between forms, dodging imaginary opponents, and apparently dispatching them one after another. The more you watch though, the more you think this isn't just some memorized kata, he's improvising, creating a dynamic scenario in his head, and reacting to it.

He performs an improbable flip in the air, lashing out with the stick, and then driving it down into the dirt on his landing.

He's breathing heavily, but there's no trembling in his motions as he stands and looks over at you. He smirks.

You can't help but laugh at the flustered expression on Khemia's face, his deep blush making it even more apparent.

<<say $mc>>Hahaha. Don't sweat it, I'm not upset! No need to for embarrassment!<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Embarrassed? Me? Of course not! Anyway, the tent is ready. Let's just move on.<</say>>
With that, Khemia hastily stuffs the last pieces of the tent into the bag, using slightly more force than necessary, and you continue your journey together.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Wow, you look absolutely stunning.<</say>>
You're taken aback by Khemia's unexpected compliment.

<<say $mc>>Uh, thanks, I guess?<</say>>
An awkward silence settles between you.

<<say $companionKhemia>>I just wanted to tell you, since you changed gender, I thought... I don't know... It might not be easy.<</say>>
He averts his gaze as he speaks. You reward him with a warm smile.

<<say $mc>>That's very sweet of you. I appreciate it.<</say>>
His face lights up at your response.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Not a problem! If anyone gives you a hard time about this, just come to me. I've got your back!<</say>>
He punctuates his declaration with a confident wink.

<<say $mc>>Uh, sure. I'll keep that in mind.<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Also, being a woman might affect your strength! Here, allow me.<</say>>
Without waiting for your consent, he reaches for your luggage.

<<say $mc>>Oh, don't worry, it's...<</say>>
He's already lifting your bag before you can finish your sentence.

<<say $companionKhemia>>No, it's you who shouldn't worry. I've got this.<</say>>
With a cheeky wink and a playful side hug, he assures you of his protective nature - a side you've not seen before. You're left wondering if this new dynamic is a welcome change or not.

As dawn breaks and you begin to dismantle the campsite, the tent becomes your nemesis, stubbornly refusing to fold neatly.

<<say $mc>>Khemia, could you lend me a hand over here?<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Of course, no problem.<</say>>
Khemia's gaze lingers on you, curiosity gleaming in his eyes.

<<say $mc>>Khemia, help please?<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Oh, right! On my way!<</say>>
He rushes over, assisting with the uncooperative tent. Despite his help, you notice him stealing glances at you.

<<say $mc>>Is there something on my face?<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Oh no, it's just... you're not as delicate as you once were.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Well, that's... blunt.<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>I didn't mean it in a bad way... You've gotten tougher! Down here, that's not a bad thing, right?<</say>>
You give a noncommittal shrug.

<<say $mc>>I suppose so, considering where we are.<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Cheer up! I was only teasing! You know me.<</say>>
He playfully nudges your shoulder, the unexpected strength momentarily catching you off guard.

<<say $mc>>Hey! That kind of hurt!<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Ah, sorry. I forgot you were still a lady for a moment.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Gee, thanks.<</say>>

You find Khemia's eyes on you once again, his lingering gaze punctuated by a thoughtful sigh.

<<say $mc>>Is there something wrong, Khemia?<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Oh, nothing at all. Why do you ask?<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Well, you keep glancing my way and sighing.<</say>>
He releases another sigh, laced with something that sounds like regret.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's a bit of a shame, that's all.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>What exactly is a shame?<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, you were such a stunning woman. And now... It's not like you're ugly, it's just... different. But hey, your new look is quite striking! I bet you would still turn heads now, right?!<</say>>
He flashes a wide grin, but the ensuing silence seems to dampen his enthusiasm.

<<say $mc>>Alright... can we just move on? Khemia, can you take these?<</say>>
<<if $app.armCount<2>>\
	You gesture toward some equipment, but Khemia hesitates. Rolling his eyes, he eventually grabs the gear.
	<<say $companionKhemia>>Alright, alright. But only because you're at a disadvantage, and you're paying me.<</say>>
	You're taken aback by his sudden change. He may not be eyeing you like before, but this new Khemia is a bit unsettling.

	You hold out some equipment to him, but Khemia makes no move to take them.

	<<say $companionKhemia>>What's the matter, can't lift them yourself?<</say>>
	<<say $mc>>Well, no, but you usually carry these...<</say>>
	You're left confused by his sudden reluctance.

	<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, you're the expedition leader, aren't you? Time to show us what you're made of! This could be a great opportunity for you to build up your strength. And men like us need to be strong down here, you know?<</say>>

Cherry's eyes focus on you, and for a moment you think you see a hint of an emotion. However, her eyes still look haunted, and she doesn't say anything in response to your brilliant humor.

As you both set off again, her gait isn't energetic. But still she walks, with a trudging endurance, bearing a burden that you don't understand. In some ways, it's even more impressive that she's able to keep moving on a journey like this despite her emotional state.

Her voice trails off, as if she can't bring herself to explain her desires to you so openly.

<<say $mc>>Not the black sheep?<</say>>
<<say $companionCherry>>No, the black cat. I guess it's because I've always been an unlucky omen for them. And I guess some part of me wished I was really a black cat, and not a person.<</say>>
<<say $companionCherry>> I wouldn't have to interact with people anymore and nobody would expect anything of me. I could finally live a peaceful, happy life.<</say>>
She looks down in silence. Her embarrassment has faded, leaving her with an empty expression, as if she's stopped caring about anything in the world.

<<say $mc>>Cherry, that's...<</say>>
<<say $companionCherry>> I know, I know. But, well, ever since I got <<if $companionCherry.curses.some(e => e.name === "Fluffy Ears") && $curse17.variation == "furry cat" >>these ears<<else>>this tail<</if>> I've been somewhat...<</say>>
<<say $companionCherry>> Happier...<</say>>
She looks at you and gives you a weak smile. It isn't joyful, but it's something. Which really is saying something for someone like Cherry.

<<say $companionCherry>>I just thought drinking milk from a saucer like a cat could add to that. But, well, milk is pretty hard to come by down here so... Yeah...<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Ah, I get it. But I'm not sure I've ever seen a real cat drink milk from a saucer, and I think we don't have proper saucers here.<</say>>
Cherry's face turns into a pout, and manages to wordlessly cut off any complaints you have about the situation.

<<say $mc>>You know what, give me a second.<</say>>
You grab one of the dishes from your backpack and gently squeeze your nipple a few times to squirt some milk onto it. You repeat the process until at least the bottom of the dish is covered with a creamy, white fluid. Then you cover yourself again and turn to Cherry.

<<say $mc>>Like this?<</say>>
You place the dish with milk on the ground and see Cherry's eyes widen, as if she didn't expect you to comply with such an unusual desire she had. At first, she seems bashful that you're not leaving her alone, but eventually, she gets on all fours, as if she fully embraced a feline identity. Then she slowly approaches the milk and begins lapping it up.

<<say $mc>>You know, you're pretty cute like this.<</say>>
You start petting her on her head and run your hands through her hair, causing her to tense up, but eventually, she relaxes and even leans into your hand as you pet her.

<<say $mc>>This seems good for you, let me know any time you want some milk.<</say>>

Cherry's presence feels closer than usual, her proximity betraying a hesitation that lingers in the air. Her eyes suggest a question on the tip of her tongue, but she seems to change her mind every time.

<<say $companionCherry>>Um, well, I just wanted to say...<</say>>

<<say $companionCloud>>If you really need something then I can make it happen for you, but you'll need to pay it back with interest, so be sure it's worth it.<</say>>
There is no hint of his typical casual suavity in his face, he looks deadly serious.

<<say $companionCloud>>Or maybe you can try one of those surprise hugs on the shopkeeper, and we can see if you'll get enough of a discount to afford everything we need. Ha ha ha!<</say>>
You can't help but crack up a little at the absurdity of the proposal.

He touches your chin lightly so you look each other in the eyes and smiles.

After an awkward moment, he starts to break out in a grin once again.

<<say $companionCloud>>Ah, I see. Well, if I'm being honest, then the answer is yes, I have.<</say>>
You can't help but hold you breath in anticipation of the story.

<<say $companionCloud>>Lies will get people killed. Lie to me again and I won't take kindly to it. If you don't know somethinng, just say so. This is no place to play pretend and you'll need to be able to recognize your own weakness to be able to survive in the Abyss.

:: Cloud Convo1
As you were walking, Cloud suddenly sprints ahead a few meters and kneels by the side of the road. When you walk over, you see him hunched over a body with multiple injuries which seem to be bullet wounds, or maybe stab wounds?

<<say $mc>> What do you think happened to him? Do you think it could have been the bandits we were warned about earlier?<</say>>
<<say $companionCloud>> Hard to say for sure, but it it were bandits, they were either cruel or simple amateurs, who wouldn't pose a real threat to us.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> What makes you say that? <</say>>
Cloud points to a spot on the back of the corpse.

<<say $companionCloud>> Look, here. He was shot in the back. <</say>>
You see cloud moving the body onto its belly to point at a gunshot wound in the upper back.

<<say $companionCloud>> But it seems off target, if you look at the angle of entry and the trauma around the shoulders, the bullet is probably lodged in there somewhere near the shoulder blades.<</say>>
He then pushes the body onto its back and points at the other wounds.

<<say $companionCloud>> And these are stab wounds, but every single one missed a vital organ. Based on the amount of blood here, my guess is that he bled out in the end after managing to get away at first.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> That sounds pretty gruesome, why would they do that to him? <</say>>

Alas, those days are long gone and now I must work to change things in the world above so that all people can have true freedom, without fear of governments or bandits.<</say>>

He opens the pack on the ground, pulls out a few dubloons and tosses them your way.

He pauses and steels his gaze even more

You sense Cloud's hands gently cup your breasts and begin to tenderly massage them. His touch is surprisingly delicate despite his formidable strength, and although your breasts are sensitive, the sensation is quite pleasurable.

<<say $companionCloud>> Now, follow my lead.<</say>>
You feel his hands guiding you to your knees and bending you forward onto your hands. He tenderly pulls at your nipples, and milk begins to stream out. A wave of relief washes over you as the pressure within your breasts subsides.

<<say $mc>>That feels amazing.<</say>>
<<say $companionCloud>>I told you it would. I used to perform a similar technique quite a bit back in the day.<</say>>
You're momentarily taken aback, but any movement is restrained by Cloud's body hovering protectively over you.

<<say $mc>>You massaged a lot of breasts?<</say>>
<<say $companionCloud>> Ha, I won't confirm or deny that, but that's not what I meant.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Oh, okay?<</say>>
You relax slightly and allow your thoughts to drift back to the serene pasture.

<<say $companionCloud>> No, back in the day, I had some experience dealing with restless cows.<</say>>
Cloud shifts to your side, all the while continuing to skillfully draw milk from your nipples.

<<say $companionCloud>>I wasn't a farmer, but sometimes during my travels, I'd find it useful to get something from them. So, I'd gently approach them, softly caress them from the side, and then help myself to the freshest possible milk while relieving their engorged udders.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Are you calling me a cow??<</say>>
Unexpectedly, the image of yourself in the same green pasture, with Cloud milking your udders, surfaces in your mind. The thought is more pleasant and far less offensive than you anticipated.

<<say $companionCloud>> Relax, I'm not calling you anything. I'm just saying I know how to help you.<</say>>
You contemplate his words and acknowledge that he has indeed been helpful thus far. Finally, Cloud expresses the last droplets of milk from your nipples with a bit more force, providing you with an indescribably satisfying release.

<<say $mc>><<if $IQdrop>20 >>HmmmMMMooooo! <<else>>Hmmmmmm! <</if>><</say>>
<<say $companionCloud>> That's what I thought. Remember, you know where to find me if you need relief again.<</say>>
He relinquishes his hold on your breasts, delivers a playful slap to your buttocks, and lets out a hearty laugh as he strolls away, leaving you to collect yourself.

<<set $companionSaeko.affec-=(1-$hsswear)>>\
You give Saeko a firm hug, after a few seconds of surprise she returns your hug limply.

<<say $mc>>I'm $mc.name, I'm happy to have you on the team with me.<</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>I can tell after that unusal greeting, you certainly seem very eager to get close to me.<</say>>
She speaks matter of factly, as if she were simply stating the sky was blue.

<<say $companionSaeko>>But I'm also glad to join you on this expedition. I think there will be some great opportunities down there and I'd like to see how well I can apply my theoretical knowledge.<</say>>

:: Saeko Convo0 Magical
<<set $companionSaeko.affec-=(1-$hsswear)>>\
<<say $mc>>Yeah, I'm excited to discover all the magical wonders the Abyss has in store for us!<</say>>
She cocks an eyebrow as a response.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Magical wonders? You don't seem to understand the gravity of what we will be encountering in the Abyss. It is not that there are simply a series of 'magical' wondrous things that we can enjoy, it is an apparent gap in our understanding of the rules of the universe. Even the simplest of the Relics or Wonders we will observe in the Abyss simply break the rules that humans have held dear for hundreds of years. We need to rethink everything that we know about the universe. But they do follow their own rules, so they can be scientifically studied.<</say>>
Saeko seems to be getting more invested now, she begins speaking more enthusiastically about Abyssal research.

<<say $companionSaeko>>And while I don't expect to immediately understand why the Abyss does what it does, I think we can at least understand how it works on a surface level. How does Miasma alter developmental processes? How long have the species in the Abyss been evolving? Can we make use of the mutational effects of the miasma intentionally in a controlled manner, perhaps cure medical conditions? The potential is nearly limitless and we need to see what we can learn from it.<</say>>
Saeko continues to talk about recent advances in research regarding the Abyss and the immense potential that the Abyss has, if we could only understand it well enough to use it. You don't get much of a chance to speak, but it is very informative.

:: Saeko Convo0 MysteryTour
<<set $companionSaeko.affec+=(1+$hsswear)>>\
<<say $mc>>Yeah, I'm thrilled to delve into all the mysteries the Abyss holds!<</say>>
You see a twinkle in her eyes and the edges of her lips curl upwards.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Me too! I actually have a new theory about the effects of miasma on the flora and fauna native to the Abyss. I hypothesize that while some organisms display the effects of an acute mutation due to miasma exposure, others show an evolution over a long period of time in the Abyss. And I think if we can identify which species have evolved in the Abyss, then we can identify their most recent common ancestor with known surface species. If we do that, we can get a better understanding of what changes long-term colonization of the Abyss had on them and even when the species diverged!<</say>>
She blushes a bit, noticing she may be getting a bit carried away.

<<say $companionSaeko>>But yeah, you might not want to hear all about it. I understand. Suffice to say that I think there is a lot we can learn and I'm quite interested in learning it.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>No, please continue! I don't know if I'll be completely able to understand, but maybe it could be useful for the trip.<</say>>
Saeko smiles widely and perks up at your interest.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Well, if you say so. Anyway, I think that if we can see the common ancestors of Abyssal species to surface species, then we can create bounds on the age of the Abyss. Like if the flairabou of the 4th layer diverged from a surface mammal 500,000 years ago, then we can conclude the Abyss must be at least 500,000 years old. That's just an example, I haven't analyzed the flairabou yet. Though I hypothesize the oldest diverging species may be on the lower levels, so if we don't go deep enough then we won't be able to put an upper bound on the age of the Abyss. <</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>And also, we may be able to learn about how the Abyss alters the evolution of the species within. If we raised a flairabou outside the Abyss, would it have the same properties or does it rely on the miasma of the Abyss to mutate its body in a certain way to stay alive? Do we need to worry about Dune Devouring Borers colonizing the Sahara if someone brought them to the surface? Right now, no one knows, but I think these are important questions to ask and I hope that further analysis of Abyssal flora and fauna can provide answers to these questions.<</say>>
Saeko continues her explanation for a while, posing more questions, hypotheses, and experiments she'd like to do to test them. You can't quite follow everything she says, as she's clearly a better researcher than teacher, but she's glad you're paying attention and tries to explain anything you ask about.

You stand a bit akwardly and wave hello over at her.

<<say $mc>>So, uh, I'm $mc.name, and we are going on an expedition into the Abyss together, I guess.<</say>>
She looks at you with a rather blank expression, as if she was merely drifting through the formalities of introductions.

:: Saeko Convo0 Contribute
<<say $mc>>Uh, of course! So um, what do you think you can contribute to the expedition? <</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>Well, I can identify safe sources of water and food in the Abyss, at least in the upper layers where it has been studied and where safe sources are even available. Deeper than layer 5 no one knows much of anything, and in some layers even with knowledge there's no perfectly safe food or water. And, uh, I have stuff for some nice tea if you want some I suppose.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Oh good so we can have some tea without being corrupted in the Abyss. It's good to have comforts like that on a journey like this.<</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>Haha, I hadn't thought of it that way, but I think you're right, it will be a nice reminder of home.<</say>>

You hand her the equipment she'll need to be carrying.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Oof. Are you sure this is only half of the equipment? It seems pretty heavy.<</say>>
You nod, but after a minute you hear her once again.

<<say $companionSaeko>> Did you take the weight of this bag into account when dividing the equipment? I think my portion may be too large. It might be more optimal if we moved some of the equipment around...<</say>>
Perhaps you should have just carried it yourself, you thinkn as you end up spending a while sorting through the gear to lighten Saeko's load.

:: Saeko Plant
Saeko persistently hovers around you, her eyes examining you with intense curiosity.

<<say $mc>>Um, Saeko, could I have some personal space, please?<</say>>
Saeko's cheeks redden slightly, but she complies and steps back.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Oh, I apologize. I got a bit carried away.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Carried away with what?<</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>With you! You're absolutely fascinating. I just want to...<</say>>
She hesitates, biting her lip.

<<say $mc>>You want to...?<</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>...cut you open!<</say>>
Alarmed, you quickly take a few steps back.

<<say $mc>>Are you out of your mind? Why would you want to attack me?!<</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>Attack you? That's not what I... <</say>>
She adjusts her glasses, looking flustered.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I see there's been a misunderstanding. You could be a tremendous asset for my PhD thesis. The miasma has imbued you with plant-like characteristics, and you undoubtedly share some traits with the local flora. However, this transformation is miasma-induced, not an evolutionary leap. You would be an excellent subject to cross-reference local flora characteristics against, in order to identify which traits have arisen due to environmental pressure and...<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Alright, I get it. I could be useful for your thesis.<</say>>
Saeko frowns and mumbles under her breath.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I was nearly finished with my explanation, but essentially; yes.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>But can you promise not to kill me while doing that?<</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>Kill you? I don't want to kill you.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Then what's all this about cutting me open?<</say>>
Saeko looks down, adjusting her glasses once more.

<<say $companionSaeko>>It appears the misunderstandings are piling up today. I only need to make a small incision, a few millimeters at most, to draw blood, collect skin tissue, and observe the healing process as to...<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Saeko, could you give me the summary, please?<</say>>
She blushes again.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Right, right. I merely want to conduct a few minor tests that won't cause you any real inconvenience. I promise! Please?<</say>>
Her attempt at a smile is so unnatural that it borders on unsettling.

If you accept her tests, the soreness and minor cuts she inflicts on you will increase your next 1 travel time by 1 day.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Incredible! You can't fathom how much this will aid my research. Frankly, I'm not even certain of its full impact yet. Allow me to gather my equipment.<</say>>
Saeko darts back and forth, assembling her gear. It appears she has a plethora of these 'minor' tests in store, as she begins connecting you to an array of measurement devices.

<<say $mc>>Ouch, that stings!<</say>>
You wince as Saeko deftly makes a small incision with a scalpel.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Would you mind maintaining a professional demeanor throughout this process?<</say>>
You spend a significant portion of the day undergoing tests.

<<say $mc>>Do these lights need to be so glaring? My skin feels like it's starting to prickle uncomfortably under their intense brightness.<</say>>
You attempt to shield your face from the piercing light that has been shining down on you for the better part of an hour.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Intriguing. Is it a tickling sensation or more akin to a burning feeling? Could you rate your discomfort on a scale from 1 to 10?<</say>>
As she speaks, she diligently records data from the computer monitor connected to various other pieces of equipment. By the end, you feel utterly drained and know you'll need some downtime to recuperate.

Saeko raises an eyebrow and gives you a piercing glare.

<<say $companionSaeko>> Which day? <</say>>
You blush, embarrassed.

<<say $mc>> The day we had to wait an extra day to dry all my equipment...<</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>> You mean when you urinated on them? <</say>>
<<say $mc>>Yes...<</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>> So, we had to deviate from the schedule and waste resources because you couldn't manage a basic task that most 5-year-olds can do? <</say>>
<<say $mc>>Jeez, I get it. You were upset.<</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>> Indeed, I don't appreciate such unexpected disruptions. However, I believe I've already devised a solution.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Oh? What's that? <</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>> Sometimes, when small children experience persistent bedwetting, adhering to a strict schedule helps. <</say>>
<<say $mc>> But I'm not a small child. <</say>>

<<say $companionSaeko>> Regardless, it's the principle that matters. If we establish a strict schedule for when you urinate and when and how much you drink, particularly in the evening, your bladder should be empty before you sleep, thus preventing any further unforeseen delays. <</say>>

<<say $companionSaeko>>Yes, I do. <</say>>
<<say $mc>>Can I have it? <</say>>

:: Pulse Bloom Forced
<<print "<<set _companion  = $companion"+ $PulseBloomUse +" >>">> 	<<set _string = "Layer" + $currentLayer + " Hub">>
Silently, you approach _companion.name,  moving stealthily to catch them off guard. You aim to coax <<if _companion.sex=="male">>him<<else>>her<</if>> into a subdued state and wrestle <<if _companion.sex=="male">>him<<else>>her<</if>> into submission.

You ignore the soft, trembling pleas echoing in the cold air, your eyes locked on the task at hand. The Pulse Bloom, vibrant and robust, rests within your grip, ready to perform its unusual magic. An uncanny silence punctuates your forceful extraction of the life fluid, the bloom absorbing it greedily, a vampire of the plant kingdom.

:: Pulse Bloom Transformation[nobr]
<<set _string = "Layer" + $currentLayer + " Hub">>
You tenderly clutch the Pulse Bloom, drawing it closer to your face, as you take a deep breath, inhaling its crimson vapors. Your nostrils flare, savoring the intoxicatingly sweet and pungent scent. Yet, oddly, nothing seems to occur immediately. Exhaling, you proceed to draw in more of these ruby-hued emissions, until the Pulse Bloom has no more to offer. You stand there in quiet anticipation, but nothing appears to be taking place.<br>
Minutes trickle by, only for you to suddenly sense your heartbeat accelerating, each pulse resonating through your veins, making your blood buzz. You're seized by an alarming dizziness, and your body flushes with a heat that is almost too much to bear. Disoriented, you stagger, attempting to regain your balance when you feel the transformation seeping into you like ink in water.<br><br>

<<if $app.heightCor < $PulseBloomStorage.heightCor>>
	Your perspective begins to warp, distorting like a reflection in a funhouse mirror. It's as if the world is towering around you, elongating and expanding. This is a disconcerting sensation, so you lower your gaze in an effort to ground yourself. But, as you do, it feels as though you're softly sinking into the earth, yet your feet remain anchored. Comprehension dawns - it isn't the world expanding; it's you, shrinking.<br><br>
<<elseif $app.heightCor > $PulseBloomStorage.heightCor>>
	It seems as if the world around you is contracting, the familiar landscape appears to become a miniature set. This surreal experience compels you to fix your gaze downwards, to regain a sense of reality. However, as you do, you feel a gentle buoyancy, as if you're lifting away from the ground, even though you're still standing still. It takes a moment, but you finally realize, it's not the world shrinking. It's you, growing.<br><br>
<</if>>

<<if $app.breastsCor > 0 && $PulseBloomStorage.breastsCor == 0>>
	The focal point of the warmth converges towards your nipples, and the surrounding areas. An irritating itch begins to take root, blossoming beneath your touch. You cup them instinctively, seeking relief, only to recoil in shock as your fingers meet with soft, pliable flesh. You knew that $PulseBloomUse had breasts, but the reality of their growth still leaves you agape.
<</if>>
<<if $app.breastsCor > $PulseBloomStorage.breastsCor >>
	The heat intensifies around your breasts. As you pant from the strain of transformation, they chafe against the confines of your clothing. You cup them, trying to stabilize the shifting mass. To your astonishment, you can feel them swelling under your touch, slowly but surely. As you lean forward, you sense a new weight tugging at you, an unfamiliar heaviness that becomes more pronounced with each passing moment. Eventually, the growth seems to stall, leaving you clutching your $app.breastsLabel cup breasts.<br><br>
<<elseif $app.breastsCor < $PulseBloomStorage.breastsCor >>
	An enveloping warmth swells around your breasts. As you gasp from the strain of the transformation, they rasp uncomfortably against your clothing. You hold them, endeavoring to secure their shifting form. Startlingly, you can feel them retracting under your touch, as if sinking into your body. In alarm, you let them go. Yet, the usual tension that accompanies such a release is conspicuously absent, replaced by a peculiar lightness. Your breasts have indeed become smaller.
<</if>>
<<if $app.breastsCor < $PulseBloomStorage.breastsCor && $app.breastsCor != 0>>
	When you gather the courage to touch them again, you find them reduced to a mere $app.breastsLabel cup size.<br><br>
<<elseif $app.breastsCor == 0 && $PulseBloomStorage.breastsCor > 0>>
	The process relentlessly continues until any sign of your breasts vanishes. You pat your chest in disbelief, almost as if in search of them. But they've disappeared, leaving you with nothing but a flat chest.<br><br>
<</if>>

<<if $app.penisCor > 0 && $PulseBloomStorage.penisCor == 0>>
	A tantalizing tingling sensation originates in your crotch. As your attention diverts towards this stirring sensation, you are jolted by waves of pleasure. The sensation is reminiscent of someone rubbing your clit, almost causing your knees to buckle. You clutch at your groin instinctively, but find nothing amiss. Nevertheless, the sensation persists, forcing you to stifle a moan. You clutch your groin even tighter and are met with a surprising sensation, as if you're encasing your clit with your whole hand, but it's disconcertingly different. As you release your hold, you glimpse a bulge forming there. Incredibly, you're growing a penis!
<</if>>
<<if $app.penisCor > $PulseBloomStorage.penisCor >>
	A wave of heat inundates your penis. It feels as though someone is gently pulling at it, a feeling both uncomfortable and tantalizingly arousing. It strains against the confines of your clothing, more and more as the transformation progresses. Eventually, a wave of pleasure washes over you, culminating in a mini climax, after which the sensations seem to ebb. When you gather the nerve to inspect it, you're presented with a $app.penisCor inch penis.<br><br>
<<elseif $app.penisCor < $PulseBloomStorage.penisCor >>
	A surge of warmth fills your penis. It feels as though a phantom hand is pushing against it, a sensation both discomforting and tantalizing. As the transformation progresses, the strain against your clothing dwindles.
<</if>>
<<if $app.penisCor < $PulseBloomStorage.penisCor && $app.penisCor != 0>>
	Eventually, you're overcome by a mini orgasm, after which the sensations seem to dissipate. Looking down, you find your penis has receded to a mere $app.penisCor inches.<br><br>
<<elseif $app.penisCor == 0 && $PulseBloomStorage.penisCor > 0>>
	At some point, the sensation of being pushed grows more intense, it feels as though you're being penetrated. This intense sexual stimulation from within you is unsettling yet thrilling. Overwhelmed, you experience a mini orgasm, after which all sensations in your groin seem to retreat. Once you regain your breath and inspect your groin, you find nothing but a smooth, feminine mound between your legs.<br><br>

It seems a few people have taken it before, but somehow it always ended up back in the Abyss.

	<<say $companionAI>> Very well, first of all I'll strongly advise you to pick up the Heart-Stealing Stole as it will hopefully make you a little more sufferable to me and your other companions. You seem to need it.<</say>>

	<<say $mc>> I'm all ears.<</say>>
	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_smirk.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Well, if you're into cute, fuzzy ears then there is a Curse for that to on this layer. But I meant that you if you get the Maximum Fluff Curse here, and the hairless Curse afterwards on the first layer. Et voila! Free corruption!<</say>>
	<<say $mc>> That's actually not a bad strategy, but it does require me to move back up again... Thanks Ai, I'll keep it in mind for when it's convenient. Anything else?<</say>>

	<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_plotting2.png">> <<say $companionAI>> You bet they would be pissed, but what will they do? Go back up alone and leave their original body behind? I don't think you need to worry about them leaving you if you're in their body.<</say>>

<<set $companionAI.name= $app.name>>
<<set $mc.name= 'Ai'>>
<</nobr>>

You open your eyes and realize your body feels undescribably strange, almost as if it weren't there at all. It takes a moment to remember slipping into that pond, but your eyes feel heavy and it's a large effort to make yourself get up. But the effort doesn't make a difference, and when your eyes are finally open you still don't see anything, as if you are blindfolded. You try to get pull off the blindfold but you can't seem to grab it. You can't even feel it on your face.

In fact, you can't even feel your arms.

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_annoyed.png">> <<say $companionAI>> What the fuck is this?<</say>>
Just as you start to wonder how your voice sounds you hear a scream. You feel as if you are moved around while simultaneously not feeling anything at all. It's very disorienting, making it hard to keep track of what's going on.

<<say $mc>> I'm real! I'm real! I'm actually real!<</say>>
Suddenly you feel youself moving even more and light finally streams into your eyes, and you see... yourself?

<<say $mc>> You actually did it! You actually did it! This is amazing, thank you so much!<</say>>
And then it dawns on you what must have happened.

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_mortified.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Oh no... Did I actually switch with you?! I didn't think it would really work.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> I know, me neither! But I'm so glad you tried! This is going to be awesome.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_shocked.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Oh my fucking... I actually lost my body? Now what am I? A virtual avatar? What the hell am I going to do? You tricked me into this!<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Slow down sister, I didn't trick you into anything. I just pondered on if it was possible and you went ahead yourself and tried it.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_crying.png">> <<say $companionAI>> I don't want this anymore, Ai. I want my body back. You stole my body, give it back.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Wow wow, don't go all panic mode on me, okay? I'm not some evil AI that wants to snatch everybody's body and take over the world. I just want to have some fun. So how about we just have some fun today, and then we'll switch back afterwards? Maybe you like all the power that comes with being a high-tech AI and we can do this more often!<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_bummed.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Okay, maybe it's not so bad to be an AI for a little bit.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_neutral_happy.png">> <<say $companionAI>> I do look pretty cute now!<</say>>
<<say $mc>> You bet your cute little rear of yours that you do!<</say>>
<<say $companionAI>> Yeah, let's just enjoy the experience and then change back tonight! Can we go back into the Fate-Crossing Star pond and switch back?<</say>>
<<say $mc>> I don't know, you're the one with the data on the Abyss now.<</say>>
<<say $companionAI>> Oh right! So how do I access this data on the Abyss...<</say>>
The moment you start thinking about the data of the Abyss, you start to remember that the Abyss has a certain origin, exits and nine layers. When you focuss your thought on the layers, you feel yourself remembering the second layer more specifcally. Remembering the second layer in turn floods your head with new memories on the threats, Relics, biome, lay-out untill you remember the wonders and start focussing on those, more specifcally the Fate-Crossing Star. You go over all the information you suddenly remembered about it.

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_shocked.png">> <<say $companionAI>>... <</say>>
<<say $mc>> Did you access the data?<</say>>
<<say $companionAI>>Yes... It only works one time.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Oh, that's inconvenient, I guess you'll be a virtual sister for a bit longer.<</say>>
She giggles, sounding strange with her mannerisms coming out of your mouth.

<<say $mc>> Anyway, where do we need to go to reverse this?<</say>>
You frantically start going through all the data, layer by layer, all Wonders, all Curses, all Relics but nothing with body swapping properties shows up.

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_mortified.png">> <<say $companionAI>>I    can't    find    anything... <</say>>
You start to feel very tired all of a sudden.

<<say $mc>> Whoa, slow down, you're overclocking the yourself quite a bit. You're draining your battery and if you're not careful you'll damage your system!<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_crying.png">> <<say $companionAI>>There has to be a way, there has to be! <</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_clueless.png">> <<say $companionAI>>Wait a second! When you proposed this, you must surely have known a way to reverse this, right Ai? <</say>>
<<say $mc>> Well, not really. You didn't ask about, so I can't remember even looking for that data<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_angry.png">> <<say $companionAI>>What do you mean I didn't ask about it? Is this a joke to you?<</say>>
Ai seems to frown as well.

<<say $mc>> Yeah, actually it sort of was. You were the person who took the joke one step further and stepped into a magical pond, remember? I didn't plan for this to happen at all, I don't have access to all the data all the time. I'm high-tech, not an omniscient god. This was not my choice nor even what I wanted to happen!<</say>>
You calm yourself down as realize Ai is right, you'll need her to fix this. If this is even fixable at all.

And so a new adventure starts. But this time you aren't the main character, this time, you're the sidekick. You keep sifting through the data and find that in the deepest part of the Abyss there may be a possible solution, but it would be quite the journey to get there. Ai does her best to descend through the Abyss as far as possible, but it continually gets tougher to traverse with each layer, and her decision to swap back with you wavers. 

At first Ai consulted you about which Curses she would take, but over time she began to take more and more Curses of her own accord. Changing "your" body to that of a small, pink-haired girl. When you complained about it she brushed you off, telling you that she also needs to feel confortable in her... your body. As time went on, you felt less and less sure that you would reach the bottom of the Abyss. Moreover, would Ai even want to change back at that point?

Until then, the best you can do is brief Ai on the ins and outs of the Abyss and hope her adventure reaches a conclusion you can also live with.

But unfortunately, this is no longer your story, it's hers.

:: Forbidden Grimoire Select
[img[setup.ImagePath+"Relics/forbiddengrimoire.png"]]
A grisly-looking ragged book written in an indecipherable language. Words can only be seen on the page when a person reads it alone, and they vanish as that one person reads them. This will take whatever skills the reader possesses and improve them greatly, leaving a blank, non-useful book behind. Mechanically speaking, if you let a companion use it, it would double the specific numeric benefit of their special ability - Khemia would reduce travel costs by 4 days, Cloud would redduce bullet costs by 4 (minimum 1), Cherry would reduce status effect lengths by2, and so on. (It doesn't really affect, say, Khemia's ability to slay monsters so much - he's already trained to nearly the maximum human limits, and if there's a monster he can't defeat, it's more about the monster simply being durable beyond the human body's limits than it is about any imperfections in his fighting sills.) Using it on yourself could help you in your normal life, but probably not very much on your journey - the benefit would be substantially less than that from using it on a companion, anyways. If one person were to read it twice (such as through Kin Shifter), the second use would have no benefit - best to spread it out among multiple companions.

It's useless once it's been used once of course, so choose wisely who will get the benefit.

Who do you want to give the grimoire to improve their skills?

:: Forbidden Grimoire Maru
While Maru great appreciates your gift and improves the taste of his cooking, you don't gain any material benefit on your journey from giving it to him.

:: Forbidden Grimoire Lily
After reading from the book, Lily's tongue seems just the slightest bit quicker and she sounds more convincing than ever. You now gain 20 extra dubloons when selling Relics with her on the surface.\
<<set $sellAdd += 10>><<set $grimoireLily = 1>>

:: Forbidden Grimoire Khemia
After reading from the book, Khemia's seems to always spot even more efficient routes than before, as if he were intuitively able to tell the best paths through the Abyss. Travel times in the Abyss are now reduced by 4 days instead of 2 while he is with you.\
<<set $timeRed += 2>><<set $grimoireKhemia = 1>>

:: Forbidden Grimoire Cherry
After reading from the book, Cherry seems to somberly ponder what she read for a few minutes, occasionally looking at her own body as if she were truly seeing it for the first time. The duration of status effects with a predetermined length is now reduced by 2 days instead of 1.\
<<set $statRed += 1>><<set $grimoireCherry = 1>>

:: Forbidden Grimoire Cloud
After reading from the book, Cloud lines up his finger with a rock in the distance, mime's a gunshot, then turns to you and smiles. <q>I've got to test out some of the stuff I saw in there, it's crazy stuff.</q> You now have to spend 4 less bullets for any task instead of 2 less.\
<<set $bullRed += 10>><<set $grimoireCloud = 1>>

:: Forbidden Grimoire Saeko
After reading from the book, Saeko's looks a bit sad as she turns the last page, as if hoping there was more to learn. After that, she is able to use innovative techniques you've never seen before to minimzie your exposure to the miasma whenever possible. You now subtract 10 from all corruption costs in the Abyss, rather than 5.\

:: Maru Layer 1

<<say $companionMaru>>I love how pretty the flowers are here, and just look at those glowing mushrooms! I bet they're really tasty. Thanks for taking me along, this is fun.<</say>>
Maru spreads his arms and whirls in a circle. It doesn't raise your confidence in his ability to face some of the dangers that are supposedly down here, but you smile in spite of yourself. It's nice to have someone cheerful along on the journey.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 1

<<say $companionLily>>This part of the Abyss is alright, but it's not my favorite. There's just not enough going on. Yes, it's pretty, but it also gets kind of boring unless you brought along a hang-glider or a kayak.<</say>>
Lily looks at you and glances over the equipment you're carrying, sees no evidence that you brought any extreme sport equipment, and then sighs. 

<<say $companionLily>>There might be a couple Relics that are useful to you here, but in general the Relics in this part aren't that valuable. I don't know, this layer is just not really my cup of tea. If you want to hang around here, we can, but I'd rather we went somewhere with more going on. Ideally some good music. Do you know the song that goes like...<</say>>
Lily starts humming and occasionally bursts out into full blown singing. This might not be her favorite part of the Abyss, but in spite of that, she seems to be having a good time.	
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 1

Khemia is smiling and nodding as he takes in the landscape around you. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>It feels great to be back down here. This layer is pretty nice. There are some bandits who try to steal Relics from people coming back up, and supplies from people coming down, but they're not so tough. If you brought a weapon, just hand it to me, and I'll take care of them. You'd think they'd get strong stealing Relics from exhausted parties, but you'd be wrong. They're pretty incompetent and I don't think they can ever pick up any of the really strong Relics.<</say>>
Khemia's grin is infectious, and he strides forward, leaping up onto the top of a nearby rock. It's clear he's in his element here.
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 1

<<say $companionCherry>>This place is okay. It reminds me of some things I thought I'd forgotten.<</say>>
Cherry's eyes are focused out in the distance. You decide that now isn't the time to press her on what she meant.
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 1

<<say $companionCloud>>There are some people who live down on this layer who seem pretty decent. They've made a town, and are living in harmony. We've got bigger plans and responsibilities though and the real secrets of this place are further down. Let's keep moving.<</say>>
You find yourself marveling at his confident charm. Did you hire him to help with your adventure, or did you just pay him for the privilege of coming along on his?
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 1

<<say $companionSaeko>>The miasma in this layer isn't very dense, but it can concentrate under certain conditions. Some of the water has concentrated miasma in it, and there are some plants and fungi that hyper-accumulate the miasma.<</say>> 
She gestures at a glowing mushroom on the side of the path as she speaks.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Initially I thought it was a defensive mechanism, but that doesn't make sense when most of the organisms in the Abyss can tolerate miasma quite well and even incorporate it into their own life cycles. It's not my primary area of study, but perhaps someday I'll get to do some experiments on it. I'd love to understand why some species accumulate the miasma so much more than others.<</say>>
Then she suddenlt looks a little bit self conscious and starts muttering. 

<<say $companionSaeko>>Errr... sorry, sometimes I can't help myself.<</say>>
Despite her apology it's clear that she's hoping you also care about this stuff.
<br>
:: Maru Layer 2

<<say $companionMaru>>Berries!<</say>>
Maru jumps up and down with excitement at the sight of the small, sweet fruits. He seems to be loving the forest down here, since he's constantly laughing about various plants. This is certainly a grand adventure to him.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 2

<<say $companionLily>>Slippery when wet!<</say>>
 Lily shouts and laughs as she slides down a slick rock. When she lands, she smiles at you. 

 <<say $companionLily>>And down here, absolutely everything is wet.<</say>>
 She casually flicks a drop of water out of your hair, then she steps backwards and does a cartwheel over a large root jutting into the path. Unconcerned that her hands just got covered in mud, she runs them through the vegetation on either side of the narrow path you're following, cleaning them off, mostly. You pause for a second, then ask 

<<if !($ConvoHandicapSmall || $ConvoHandicapLarge)>>\
	<<say $mc>>Who maintains this path anyway?<</say>>
	She laughs at the question for a moment before she answers. 

	<<say $companionLily>>Maintains? Nobody maintains it. There are a bunch of them down here. They're made by wandering adventurers like us, or maybe the Abyss just makes them on its own, or maybe they're just a bunch of Baying Gourmet trails.<</say>>
	You stop in your tracks, suddenly getting nervous. She looks back at you and rolls her eyes.

	<<say $companionLily>>Oh, they're out there, but there's no point in getting all scared. We're in this together. We'll face what comes, and we shall triumph!<</say>>
	She pumps her fist in the air, and expertly slides down another root, vanishing into a rustle of leaves as the path turns. You're not sure if Lily is one of the bravest people you've ever met, or just one of the craziest. You're glad you're not alone down here though.	
<</if>>\
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 2

<<say $companionKhemia>>When I first started coming down here, I just tried running over all these plants. Ha, I fell on my face a few times when my foot got snagged. There's a trick to it, winding your way through them, lopping off anything blocking the best path forward.<</say>>
He looks towards you and launches into a tale. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>There was one time when a Baying Gourmet jumped one of my party members. An on that dive, the party leader was a cheapskate who hadn't brought along a sword or any other weapons. I got lucky and dodged its claws and somehow was able to jump on its back, but the damn thing took off with me on top of it! I hung on, not wanting it to get loose and turn on me, and managed to ride it for what must have been at least a kilometer, up and down multiple trees, it was a blast. Eventually it just whimpered and laid down in the mud.<</say>>
He smiles broadly, clearly pleased at his impressive escapade.

<<say $companionKhemia>>So I left it there, but when I tracked down the rest of my party, they'd hardly moved at all! Initiative, that's the biggest thing that sets the good explorers apart from the bad ones. So don't get rattled, just do what needs to be done, and if I should get hauled away, do try to come find me.<</say>>
Khemia smirks, and continues leading the way through the thick foliage.	
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 2

<<say $companionCherry>>I like the rain down here. The mist, the plants, all of it... It's peaceful.<</say>>
The forest might strike some people as a bit unnerving, but you're glad that at least Cherry is finding some solace in it.	
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 2

<<say $companionCloud>>I think you might find a Relic on this layer that could enhance your abilities as a leader. There are some who claim that it's better to be feared than loved, but I've never agreed with that precept. If we are to make the world a better place, we must do it through love.<</say>>
The gently falling drops of water seem to bounce off Cloud's hair, and his footing never falters on the wet ground. You can't quite explain how he manages to maintain such calm poise in a jungle like this, but he does, and his presence is reassuring.	
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 2

<<say $companionSaeko>>I love this place.<</say>>
There's a look of eager wonder in Saeko's eyes as she examines the flora around you. The mist and dripping condensation remind you of a phrase you once heard: 'where there is water, there is life'. Saeko certainly seems energized by the quantity of slightly exotic biomass around you. She occasionally stoops down to take a small sample or examine one of the organisms you're passing along the journey. Every now and then she points to an insect, slug, or flower and mentions something about its genus and species or stares in wonder because she doesn't know what it is.

There is something endearing about her passionate curiosity. Sometimes it seems to you that her mind is a place of indexed facts, almost robotic in its logic, but other times the full vitality of a lively brilliance shines through her normally controlled demeanor. It's good she's excited, but you also hope her sample collecting doesn't slow you down too much.
<br>
:: Maru Layer 3

<<say $companionMaru>>You know, these dark caves aren't my favorite place. I always feel like something is going to come out of the darkness and grab me.<</say>>
His normally enthusiastic attitude has turned to muted anxiety. Maybe you shouldn't linger in the darkness of these caves for too long.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 3

<<say $companionLily>>This place is a mixed bag. One the one hand, it's so dark and gloomy that it's sure to drive you bonkers. On the other hand, the echoes are totally sweet.<</say>>
She raises her voice and sings a few notes, making the caverns send the echoes back to you, producing an oscilating set of musical chords that is both beautiful and unnerving. It's also way too loud! You look at her wide-eyed with alarm, not sure what is out there that might have just heard her in the dark. She laughs and pats you on the shoulder.

<<say $companionLily>>Don't worry, you've got me, and I'm sure we'll be fine. Might as well have a bit of fun, or you'll be bonkers in no time.<</say>>
You close your eyes briefly, thinking that the stress of her echoing voice isn't helping much, but then you breathe. Whatever comes will come. It doesn't lessen the dark and oppressive nature of the stone around you, but somehow the exchange makes you feel a little bit better about it. Lily might act carefree, but she knows what she's doing, hopefully.
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 3

<<say $companionKhemia>>They say you can't map the Abyss, and this is true, but if you come down here enough you begin to get a feel for it. You start to recognize things, like the curvature of a particular stalagmite or the patterns of the echoes. I couldn't draw you a map of these caves, but I can help you find your way through them and back out again.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 3

<<say $companionCherry>>It's very dark here. I'm not afraid of the dark or anything, but... the darkness leaves us alone in our thoughts. Stay close, this is not the kind of place we want to get lost or separated.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 3

<<say $companionCloud>>Perception and thought are the key to overcoming most obstacles. The darkness here obscures some helpful things, and some dangerous ones. Staying calm and alert will see us through any of the challenges we face here.<</say>>
Cloud smiles at you, and the darkness feels a bit less oppresive.
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 3

<<say $companionSaeko>>The macroscopic biodiversity is lower on this layer of the Abyss, but there are still some thriving fungi, a few animals, and lots of microbes. My knowledge of what is deeper down starts to get pretty scant, but this layer is still fairly well-documented. There are a few protists that I've heard form communities down here and do some fascinating things. If I only could manage to get a sample...<</say>>
She trails off, then nods her head. 

<<say $companionSaeko>>Lead on, I'll be right behind you.<</say>>
She gives you a somewhat nervous smile. You're not entirely reassured, but continue on your way through the seemingly endless caverns.
<br>
:: Maru Layer 4

Maru throws a snowball at you, laughing. 

<<say $companionMaru>>This place is fun!<</say>>
You brush some powdered snow out of your hair, and raise an eyebrow at him. Lately his cooking has been exceptional, but you're surprised how well he's holding up. Then a chill wind whistles through the pass, carrying a sense of foreboding with it. Maru looks around nervously that hurries closer to you, huddling in on himself against the cold. You force yourself to smile at him, despite your own unease and he gives a nervous smile back.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 4

A snowflake lands on a Lily's hair. She responds with an exhasperated half-smile before blowing a jet of air at it. You watch as the snowflake rejoins the wind and floats away. Normally you can't get her to stop talking, but here she's uncharacteristically quiet sometimes. The crunch of your footsteps through the snowy path is strange, like multiple little pops. Lily's thoughts seem to be mirroring your own.

<<say $companionLily>>Do you think any of this snow ever melts? I'd guess not, but if it doesn't, how deep does it go?<</say>>
There's a pause while you both worry about falling down into a 100 meter snowdrift or a hidden crevice in the ice. Then Lily seems to come back to herself, a true smile once again upon her face as she begins chattering and looks up at the icy peaks that tower above you. In this frozen landscape, she's a good friend to have.
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 4

Khemia stands atop a rock jutting out of the snow and ice peering into the distance. A chill wind whips around him, but he seems unfazed.

<<say $companionKhemia>>There's a foe that lurks on this layer that I cannot touch. Almost everything in the Abyss stays on its own layer, but not this one. It doesn't bother those of us with the purity gene, but you are in danger, and neither I nor anyone else can protect you. From here on out, it would be wise not to dither too much.<</say>>
Snow whips around both of you in this barren landscape of rock and ice. Sometimes Khemia is reassuring or awe inspiring, and sometimes he's a bit frightening. His advice is probably sound though, as you do feel like something dark is watching you more intently each day you spend here.
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 4

Cherry trudges along a bit behind you, but the snow doesn't seem to bother her. In fact, she seems to hardly notice the cold. Her breath condenses into small clouds that part around her face. She briefly meets your eyes and gives you a small smile. You're not sure how she conveys so much with a simple expression, but you sense that she's more at peace down here, trudging through the snow, then she has been in some time.
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 4

<<say $companionCloud>>The glaciers here tell a story, a tale of countless snows beyond measure. This place has never known the warmth of spring. In some ways it is akin to the world above; harsh, unforgiving, where life is a struggle for most, and even those who aren't struggling are afraid that they might fall, and struggle again. I do not know what force makes this layer of the Abyss the way it is, but my instincts tell me that one who could bring peace and prosperity to a place like this, could also heal the world above.<</say>>
Cloud stares out at the frozen peaks and deep chasms in this frigid place. 

<<say $companionCloud>>Could one with a sufficiently warm heart thaw even this ice, or would the attempt merely freeze their heart? There is power in the cold, but it is not kind, and is ill-suited for bringing joy to anyone.<</say>>
Normally Cloud radiates confidence, but here he seems wistful, or even worried. His reveries are probably not useful to the task at hand though, and after a few more moments he returns to walking. Deep truths will wait for now, there are Relics to find and places to go.
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 4

<<say $companionSaeko>>Negative fourteen degrees C.<</say>>
Saeko sighs, apparently measuring the temperature once again, as you have seen her do many times while here.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I don't understand it. No matter where we go in this layer, it's negative fourteen degrees C. It's like there's some giant thermostat carefully maintaining the temperature. Even if I insulate the thermostat, it read negative fourteen degrees C.<</say>>
She shakes her head. 

<<say $companionSaeko>>The algae in these glaciers have processed the miasma in such a way that they make things ingesting them bigger or smaller, but why, and how? Where does the mass even come from? Where does it go?<</say>>
Saeko is apparently frustrated, but then a spark comes into her eyes.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Ah, unrelated, but I have a hypothesis to test. The drifting swallowers on this layer, big floaty things that try to eat you, some previous researchers thought they used hydrogen or helium to keep themselves afloat, but I think it's simpler than that. I think they're just heating the air in the gasseous sacks with their body temperature. I bet they've got blood vessels that contract and expand around those sacks to regulate how buoyant they are by the temperature of the air inside them, and thus how much they expand. It's just like a hot air balloon, only... they try to eat you. There might be a way to use that to our advantage.<</say>>
<br>
:: Maru Layer 5

<<say $companionMaru>>Flowers and sand!<</say>>
Maru is shouting.

<<say $companionMaru>>Sand and flowers, Flowers and Sand. Everything is flowers and sand.<</say>>
You find yourself agreeing with him. His outburst might not be especially insightful, but you understand his exasperation. At first this flowery sandy desert was a lot of fun to walk through but now it's just tiring. All the flowers start to look the same after a while, and all the petals that blow across the dunes are dry. Every now and then interesting rocky outcroppings peak out of the sand, but for the most part, in spite of the flowers, the terrain is painfully monotonous. Here you are, in the middle of this vast plain of sand beneath a bright "sky" that seems like it shouldn't be there... You're pretty sure you're actually beneath the planet's crust right now, aren't you? What exactly is going on here?
<br>
:: Lily Layer 5

<<say $companionLily>>Okay, I'm officially tired of walking through all this sand. I'm tired of these stupid flowers too.<</say>>
Lily spits out a petal that floated into her mouth as she complains.

<<say $companionLily>>Look, I get it, we've got to keep moving, but seriously we should figure out how to ride one of those Dune Devouring Borers, because they seem like they can move way faster.<</say>>
You give Lily a meaningful look, but she doesn't relent.

<<say $companionLily>>No, I'm serious, it would be fun, and efficient; it's a good idea.<</say>>
You'll have to think about how you might attempt such a thing the next time a Dune Devouring Borer attacks your party, but it doesn't seem like something you'd be able to do easily.
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 5

<<say $companionKhemia>>This is as deep as I've ever gone in past dives. The desert is huge, and often deadly and the Relics are often hidden in trapped passages and tombs. Most explorer parties that venture into the Abyss turn back before this point, and many that make it this far make it back up.<</say>>
Khemia sighs as he looks out at the landscape of unforgiving sands.

<<say $companionKhemia>>I once accompanied a man named Phillip, he was a pretty good leader, but this desert was the death of him.<</say>>
Khemia gestures around at the scorching, inhospitable sands, then gives you a very direct look.

<<say $companionKhemia>>The most important part of my job is to try to get you back out of this place alive. Make sure you have enough supplies, and if you get hurt, use a medkit. If something goes badly wrong, consider settling rather than dying. This desert has its own kind of peace, and even though it's not where I'd want to spend the rest of my life, it's better than losing the rest of your life to death.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 5

<<say $companionCherry>>It's too bright here<</say>>
Cherry squints against the light as she complains.

<<say $companionCherry>>That's not even really the sun. Ugh... nevermind, it's not important. Let's just keep going.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 5

<<say $companionCloud>>A trillion petals fly across this desert made of dreams, but now we're far beneath the earth and naught is what it seems. We must swim across this ocean of slow moving waves of sand, to find some precious Relics that can help restore our land. Threats rise up to greet us for they know not why we've come, but none can stand against us beneath this artificial sun.<</say>>
Cloud sighs deeply, breathing in the dry desert air.

<<say $companionCloud>>Sometimes words help us, but not always. This journey has brought us far, let us make it worth the trip.<</say>>
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 5

<<say $companionSaeko>>How are there all these flowers with so little water? Normal flowers are extremely delicate, the petals are turgid with water pressure, the process of pollination and seed development is extremely vulnerable to drought-like conditions, the anthers and stigma require sufficient water for the process to work. These flowers though, they're everywhere, but they don't actually have any reproductive organs on them. They're not doing what flowers are supposed to do. On top of that, they're practically anhydrous.<</say>>
Saeko runs her fingers through her hair as she paces back and forth.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I don't get it. I've taken careful notes, and the physiology indicates there are at least 17 species of these flowers down here, really just flowers, slender stalks supporting petals with no roots to speak of, and they're clearly reproducing like mad, but there's no water in them, and they're not even engaging in any kind of reproduction I understand. Are they vegetatively propagating? Are the petals themselves a means of tissue separation and dispersal? I've heard there might be a research facility in this vast desert somewhere, have they figured out what's going on here?<</say>>
She seems to mostly be talking to herself, but eventually her eyes lock on yours.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I don't know how these pseudo-flowers are doing what they're doing, but you and I, we need water. Our cells are full of water, they only work because they're full of water. You're the leader here. Make sure we've got enough water, and for goodness sake, do not let us get eaten by one of those giant worms.<</say>>
<br>
:: Maru Layer 6

<<say $companionMaru>>No, nonono, I said NO you stupid tentacle!<</say>>
Maru shouts, repeatedly kicking at one of the many tentacles that keeps trying to climb up his skirt. You look back at him with some sympathy. Not far away you can see the river Dycx, and you hear the rumbling of a flock of Omen Eyes. Every now and then you have come across a deep pit that curves down under the land. Even the walls of those pits have been lined in tentacles. Eventually Maru stops attacking the tentacle and rushes to catch up with you.
<br>
:: Lily Layer 6

<<say $companionLily>>Well this is different.<</say>>
Lily speaks with a rye smile on her face.

<<say $companionLily>>I'd heard a couple stories, but I've never actually talked with anyone who's gone this deep before. To think, hell is just full of a bunch of perverted tentacles. It's quite a sight to...<</say>>
She brushes another questing tentacle away from her thigh...

<<say $companionLily>>Feel.<</say>>
She rolls her eyes, then looks into the distance at a great roaring fire that's searing part of the vast tentacle fields a kilometer away.

<<say $companionLily>>Let's also try to avoid getting burned. This place is super weird, but hey, sometimes you've just gotta roll with it.<</say>>
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 6

Khemia has been acting strangely ever since you got here. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>Wow, I still can't believe we've actually made it. I've heard stories, but... I finally got a leader with the ambition and ability to plunge this deep. It's exciting.<</say>>
He grins at you, but then his expression becomes a bit more uncertain.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's also a bit much at first. All the earlier layers I've had experience on, but this place is weirder than I thought it would be.<</say>>
His eyes seem to gain a glint as he looks at the surroundings.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Don't worry though, we've got this. The same skills that brought us this far will see us through whatever we face next. I do think we should be careful about spending too much time here unless we can find some way to deal with these tentacles though. The ones burning with multicolored flames seem pretty sinister.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 6

Cherry looks around skeptically at the endless fields of writhing tentacles, and burning tentacles, and slowly shifting infernos that leave behind only ash. She sighs.

<<say $companionCherry>>Lead the way.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 6

A calculating look comes over Cloud's face as he whispers.

<<say $companionCloud>>Here there be dragons.<</say>>
He glances acorss the landscape and seems to take it in. 

<<say $companionCloud>>It's not enough though. There are powerful Relics here in this disturbing place, but I think we'd need to go deeper. We'll also need to find a way to deal with some of the hexed magic we're already being exposed to. If we don't, the longer we stay here the more it will slow us down, and it will be unpleasant to boot.<</say>>
He gives you a very direct look.

<<say $companionCloud>>Unless you're super fond of tentacles, we need to get back to the surface, and we need to survive the attempt. Don't forget our purpose, and don't underestimate the danger, but I can feel it in my bones that there's something important deeper down.<</say>>
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 6

Saeko shies away from a particularly vigorous tentacle in the path and shakes her head.

<<say $companionSaeko>>This is very weird.<</say>>
You look at her in surprise. Normally Saeko is full of detailed observations and theories, but not today. You ask her what's wrong, and she just shakes her head again.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Look, I don't have an explanation for burning fields of tentacles. I thought the tentacle beasts we saw earlier might have been related to surface cephalopods, but now that seems much less likely. They probably share some common ancestor with these... field tentacles, but I have no idea what that would be. And I really don't like walking around this infernal place that doesn't even have a single plant, but I'll do my best to keep us protected from the effects of the miasma while we're down here. I'm just going to focus on that for right now.<</say>>
<br>
:: Maru Layer 7

<<say $companionMaru>>I almost like this place, but with all this advanced technology, all they have are the same barely-edible vending machine rations. It's really not much to work with.<</say>>
Maru shakes his head, looking indignant at the cullinary limitations of this city.

<<say $companionMaru>>I'll tell you, robots just don't appreciate good food. Whoever built them must have given up and left out of sheer boredom from eating these same terrible rations day in and day out. There are no mushrooms, no berries, not even a rat. What kind of a city doesn't even have rats?<</say>>
<br>
:: Lily Layer 7

Lily looks quizically at the city around you.

<<say $companionLily>>It just seems silly, you know? Why all these buildings? Why are there these jobs? What are all these robots even doing? Taxes? Taxes in the Abyss? It just seems so ridiculous.<</say>>
You give her a sideways smile, she does have a point, but she's not done... alas, Lily is never, ever done talking.

<<say $companionLily>>Why on earth do robots need houses? Couldn't they all just power down and be content? Now mind you, I've never been a robot, and I don't think I'd want to be one, because being a robot sounds insufferably boring, but if I were a robot, I'd have a hard time rationalizing my programming that was telling me to do all these ridiculous things that make no sense. Move rocks around? Paint stuff? You're a robot, just program yourself to be satisfied with the way things are. Unless... do you think it's the Abyss that's programming them somehow? Wait, I have an idea, we could program them to play music. I don't know how to do that, but it would be super fun. Do you have any Relics that could make all these silly robots sing a song together? No? Ah... that's okay.<</say>>
The monologue never ends...
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 7

Khemia looks a bit shaken.

<<say $companionKhemia>>This place... I've never even imagined anything like this.<</say>>
He looks down at his hands and almost seems to tremble for a moment.

<<say $companionKhemia>>What good is swordsmanship against limitless armies of metal machines?<</say>>
You try to cheer him up a bit, but he just shakes his head.

<<say $companionKhemia>>There's some impressive stuff here, but to me, this all just feels a bit wrong. I thought I knew what the Abyss was about, but the deeper we go, the less sure I am.<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 7

<<say $companionCherry>>It's frozen.<</say>>
<<if !($ConvoHandicapSmall || $ConvoHandicapLarge)>>\
	<<say $mc>>What?<</say>>
<<else>>\
	You try to make clear you don't understand what she means.
<</if>>\

<<say $companionCherry>>This place. It looks alive, but it isn't. All these robots, they move, but they're also frozen. Everything here is waiting, waiting for a day that will never come.<</say>>
Her tone is hollow, but this is more than Cherry usually says. Somehow, deep down, you know that she has spoken a truth.
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 7

<<say $companionCloud>>Yes, this is the place. But, where are they? The ones who designed and created this, where have they gone? Their machines still whir about, but... could it be that they are no more?<</say>>
Cloud is unusually agitated, still in command of himself, but not exactly calm.

<<say $companionCloud>>Regardless, the technology here, the power here, this could change the world. Between the Relics on this layer and the ones on the upper layers, it's possible for us to do something big. Let's gather what we can.<</say>>
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 7

<<say $companionSaeko>>To think, this has been down here, all this technology, all this power, and we didn't even know. How long has it been like this? Is this an evolving robotic society, or just... no, it doesn't seem like it. These systems, they lack something vital about them. They're artificial, not organic.<</say>>
You ask her how she knows. She gives you a faint smile.

<<say $companionSaeko>>It's just a hypothesis, I don't have the experimental data I'd really need to justify that conclusion, but just look at the robots. They're mass produced, you can tell. Look at how they move. Those movements are a result of programming, not a biological intelligence that's making subtle mistakes and correcting them. Have you ever really watched a colony of ants? Ants are pretty alien to us, their thinking is strange, their movements are strange, but even ants display far more characteristics of life in their actions that any of these robots do. Ant brains are simple, but they still think. It's different from calculation. These robots, none that I've seen seem to be displaying indications of actual thought.<</say>>
<br>
:: Maru Layer 8

<<say $companionMaru>>I feel like we're at a tea party inside a doll house, but that the person throwing the tea party isn't very nice.<</say>>
You look over at Maru, he's dealing with all of this better than you'd have expected.

<<say $companionMaru>>My sisters used to have tea parties with me when I was young, they taught me how to make crumpets and scones, they gave me lessons on properly preparing the tea, and manners... I really miss them. Being down here, it reminds me of all the fun we had. They were really nice. They weren't perfect or anything, everyone has flaws, but they tried to be nice. I think that whoever is throwing this tea party doesn't understand kindness or love. Still, we're down here together, I'll do my best to make up for what they were missing.<</say>>
<br>
:: Lily Layer 8

<<say $companionLily>>I've got to tell you, when we first came down here I thought that all this crazy space-warping architecture would drive me nuts. However, I'm starting to like it. Oh, don't get me wrong, this place is totally screwed up, creepy puppet things lurking around corners, weird nightmares, endless hallways of rooms that are all just a bit too eerie, but you know, it's also kind of fun. Sure this place is all messed up, but it's our adventure. I've never heard of anyone who actually came down this far before, and as explorers, we're pretty cool.<</say>>
Lily puffs out her chest and strikes a pose of supreme confidence then gets a mischevious grin on her face.

<<say $companionLily>>Do you think that we never hear about people coming this deep because their balloons don't reach the surface, and nobody who comes this deep is able to return alive?<</say>>
Despite her joking tone, you get a slight chill down your spine. This unnerving place has been giving you that impression the whole time you've been on this layer, but Lily laughs.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh relax. We'll get out of here, and then they're going to tell stories about us for ages. The team that cracked the 8th seal, $app.name and Lily, the paladins of doom and their journey beyond time and space. Okay, maybe that's a bit overly dramatic, but we're making history here. Keep your chin up, and stay stylish, we've got this.<</say>>
<br>
:: Khemia Layer 8

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, these doll things that keep following us are easy to take down, but their movements are weird. I wonder how many of them there are in this place, and what they even are. Where do they come from?<</say>>
He's looking a bit more confident than he did back on layer 7, but he's still clearly a bit on edge. He smiles. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's strange, I love exploring, adventure, combat, all this stuff. I'm the most experienced companion in the entire guild, but I feel a little torn about this place now that we're so deep. Since we came down into this labyrinth of stairways and empty rooms, I've had this prickle on the back of my neck. There's something about this place that's very dangerous, and I love it, I love the creepy adventure of it all, but at the same time, I'm not quite sure I can handle it.<</say>>
Khemia peeks his head around a hallway corner, checking for danger.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's like this violin is holding one high note the whole time we're down here, and I can't decide if I'm in love with this layer, or if I hate it. Every time we turn a corner I'm expecting something horrific to happen. Am I going crazy?<</say>>
<br>
:: Cherry Layer 8

<<say $companionCherry>>Games... do you ever wonder why we play their games?<</say>>
You look at Cherry quizically, and she stares back blankly.

<<say $companionCherry>>I mean it's obvious, right? Everything here is a puppet. Nothing here is entirely real, it's all a game.<</say>>
You still don't understand what she means. She sighs.

<<say $companionCherry>>I just can't help but wonder if we're not puppets too. Is there something out there, pulling on our strings, forcing us to do these things? Nothing down here makes sense, except that.<</say>>
Then she is silent, and just trails along after you as you proceed along yet another uncanny corridor.
<br>
:: Cloud Layer 8

Cloud appears somewhat distressed.

<<say $companionCloud>>This place... it should not be.<</say>>
He looks at you intensely.

<<say $companionCloud>>Can't you feel it? There's something very wrong here. These endless stairs to nowhere, these passages, the weird dolls, the food, the water, everything is just... wrong.<</say>>
Part of you isn't sure what he's talking about, because everything in the Abyss has felt kind of wrong to you, though not always in a bad way. Another part of you resonates strongly with what he said though. There is something deeply unnerving about this layer that's different from the ones before it.
<br>
:: Saeko Layer 8

<<say $companionSaeko>>Okay, I'm trying not to freak out, but this place is unnerving. Physics isn't working properly here. That in and of itself should be very alarming. The "food" and "water" both seem to have neuro-degenerative effects, which personally terrifies me. And when I look at surfaces through my microscope, do you know what I see?<</say>>
You shake your head, unaware of her observations.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Nothing! No fungal spores, no bacteria, no tiny insects, nothing. I can do my best to keep us protected, but even my best efforts aren't really enough. This place should not exist. We probably shouldn't be here. These animated doll-like things just aren't right. I saw one of them earlier that looked just like you, but it was wrong and I knew it wasn't anything like you. I'm afraid here, and you should be too.<</say>>
<br>

:: LilyConvoLac Rep
<<say $companionLily>>Come here sweety, it's time to drink up again.<</say>>
Without protesting you go to Lily. She sits down and bares her breast, exposing her enticing nipple for you. You lay your head in her lap and take her nipple in your mouth, then begin to gently suck.

<<say $companionLily>>Drink as much as you can, so can become big and strong.<</say>>
Lily whispers softly to you, in a way that makes it seems she's really getting into this fantasy. You suckle her sweat breastmilk while she runs he hand through your hair lovingly.

<<say $companionLily>>Well, maybe don't become <i>too</i> big and strong.<</say>>
She giggles as you continue to drink your fill, her nourishing milk flowing freely through your lips. 

:: CherryConvoLac Rep
Cherry is hovering around you again, as if she is anticipating something. The fact she is actually approaching you likely means something, and you suspect you know what it is.

<<if !($ConvoHandicapSmall || $ConvoHandicapLarge)>>\
	<<say $mc>>Give me a moment.<</say>>
<<else>>\
	You smile gently and nod to her, giving a signal to get closer to you.

You pull out a dish and fill it with your breastmilk, then present it to her.

<<if !($ConvoHandicapSmall || $ConvoHandicapLarge)>>\
	<<say $mc>>Here, kitty!<</say>>
<<else>>\
	You whistle to get her attention and she slowly approaches.
<</if>>\
Cherry seems happy to come over to you, or at least it seems a little less like a chore than everything else she does. She brushes up against you as she approaches the plate. You pet her head and run your hands through her hair while she laps it up.

<<say $companionCloud>>You're leaking again.<</say>>
Cloud speaks matter-of-factly, a simple statement of fact. But he follows through on those implications as he approaches you. You look down to check your clothes, but Cloud is already helping you out of them. He bends you over while he sits on his knees beside you.

<<say $companionCloud>>Just relax, I know you enjoy these sessions. Sometimes, it's good to relax and let things flow. Let me take control here.<</say>>
You can hardly argue with him as he begins to massage your breasts. The gentle sensation spreads a wave of relief through your body as it clears you of your stockpile of milk. You feel the pressure in your chest alleviated as his massage squeezes the liquid from your breasts.

You're taken aback and puzzled by Maru's question.

Heat surges to your cheeks as Maru probes further.

<<say $mc>>Yes, it works just fine. Thanks.<</say>><br>

As you stroll by Lily, she affectionately pats your cushioned rear.

As you pivot, you catch Khemia's eyes lingering on your posterior. Does he know about your diapered state? You tug your clothes down slightly to conceal it better.

You notice Khemia's gaze fixated on your behind once more.

	As you glance at him, he rolls his eyes in response.
	<<say $companionKhemia>>Let's get moving, diaper boy. At least your lack of bathroom breaks should save us some time.<</say>>
<</if>>
It's evident that he's lost some respect for you since you started wearing a diaper.<br>

:: Doll Diapered 1
A sudden, desperate need to pee washes over you. Frantically, you paw at the diaper hidden beneath your dress, but there's no way to remove it.

<<say $mc>>You stupid doll. Take this thing off now! I need to go, I don't need it now!<</say>>
<<say $creepydoll>>...<</say>>
<<say $mc>>I know you can hear me. Do something!<</say>>
<<say $creepydoll>>...<</say>>
In that moment, you lose control, and the diaper grows warm as you helplessly release.

<<say $mc>>No, no, no!<</say>>
<<say $creepydoll>>...accept...<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Well, at least it's not my fault. It's that cursed doll doing this.<</say>>
<<set $dolleventWet +=1 >><br>

Once again, the urge to pee returns. By now, you know that resisting is futile, as the doll won't relent. Before the thought even finishes forming, you feel the familiar warmth of a freshly wet diaper.

<<say $mc>>Curse that doll...<</say>>
<<say $creepydoll>>...accept...<</say>>
<<say $mc>>The warm diaper doesn't feel that bad at least, and it will clean itself before too long anyway.<</say>>

<<say $mc>>But I don't feel the need to...<</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>I insist that you try anyway.<</say>>
Reluctantly, you rise and search for a place to relieve yourself. To your surprise, you do need to go. Perhaps this schedule is more necessary than you initially thought.<br>

<<say $companionSaeko>>Alright, $app.name, it's time for bed.<</say>>
You let out a heavy, exasperated sigh.

<<say $mc>>I was actually planning on doing some more things. Why do I have to go to bed so early?<</say>>
<<say $companionSaeko>>The schedule dictates your bedtime, and there's no room for negotiation.<</say>>
With another deep sigh, you concede and start preparing for bed.<br>

Exhausted from the long walk you had today, you eagerly reach for a sip of water. Just as you're about to take a gulp, Saeko snatches the bottle from your grasp, nearly causing you to choke.

As you wander through the otherworldly splendor of the first layer, Maru approaches you with a wide smile on his face.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh, look at you!<</say>>
Maru's voice is a melody, light and joyous, as he bounds over to where you sit on a mossy log. His big blue eyes are wide with wonder as he examines your new appearance.

You feel his small fingers gently tracing the freckles and moles that now adorn your skin. They are warm, a comforting touch amidst the alien grandeur of the Abyss. He giggles softly, poking at one of the speckles on your arm.

<<say $mc>>Do you like them?<</say>>
You ask, raising an eyebrow as you watch him examine your skin.

Maru responds with an enthusiastic nod, his tousled hair bobbing with the motion. His eyes sparkle with a mixture of curiosity and delight.

<<say $companionMaru>>They're so cute! Like little stars scattered across the sky, but on you!<</say>>
He gushes, his words tumbling out like a bubbling brook.

He then gently brushes his fingers over the under-eye beauty mark, his face full of innocent fascination. His touch is gentle, his fingers barely grazing your skin, yet the sensation sends a warm shiver down your spine.

<<say $companionMaru>>And this one...<</say>>
Maru coos, touching the beauty mark under your eye.

<<say $companionMaru>>Is my favorite. It's like a little teardrop, but it doesn't make me feel sad. It makes you look even more interesting!<</say>>
Feeling a blush creeping onto your cheeks, you laugh, shaking your head slightly.

<<say $mc>>Well, I'm glad you approve, Maru.<</say>>
He giggles again, the sound like wind chimes in the early morning breeze, before bounding away to explore more of the strange new world around him. You're left with a gentle smile on your lips and a warmth in your heart.

:: Maru Knife-ear

The delicate light filtering through the thick foliage of the Abyss' first layer paints an ethereal backdrop as you find yourself rousing from a night of fitful slumber. The crunch of leaves underfoot and the rustle of fabric announce Maru's approach before he bounces into view, his hair tousled and his eyes sparkling with the excitement of a new day.

<<say $companionMaru>>Good morning, sleepyhead! Oh, you look different... and cute! I like it!<</say>>
His words are a cheery chirp, his gaze tracing over the changed form of your ears with unabashed curiosity.

<<say $mc>>Do I? I guess I do feel a little different.<</say>>
You reach up, fingertips brushing over the new contours of your ears, their sharp, pointy tips a triggering a strange sensation that sends a shiver down your spine.

Maru tilts his head to the side, curiosity gleaming in his eyes as he reaches out with a hesitant hand, his fingers hovering just shy of your ears.

<<say $companionMaru>>Can I... can I touch 'em? They're so... so... elfy!<</say>>
His words tumble out in a rush, a flush spreading across his cheeks, accentuating the adorable shape of his nose.

<<say $mc>>Sure, just be gentle.<</say>>
As his fingers delicately trace the curves of your ears, a soft gasp escapes him, his eyes widening. You also gasp at the unfamiliar sensuality of your new ears.

<<say $companionMaru>>They're so soft... and really warm! You're like a real elf now!<</say>>
His excitement is palpable, and it's infectious. Despite the strangeness of your transformation, you can't help but share in Maru's joy, his enthusiasm reminding you of the wonder inherent in the ever-changing world of the Abyss.

:: Maru Hair Removal

As you wander through the first layer, a chorus of alien bird songs flutter through the air, creating an otherworldly symphony. This alien realm, while beautiful, still holds an uncanny atmosphere that serves as a constant reminder of its inherent oddity.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh! Look at you, all shiny and smooth! Your skin is like a baby's!<</say>>
Maru's eyes sparkle with amusement as he observes you, his words filled with childlike wonder. His hands, small and soft, reach out to touch your bare arms. He hesitates for a moment before reaching forward and gently caressing your skin. He giggles softly, the sound echoing off the surrounding vegetation.

<<say $mc>>It's a little strange, isn't it? I'm not used to being so... hairless.<</say>>
You glance at your arms, at the skin that now shines almost pearlescent in the strange miasmal light. The sensation of Maru's touch is more apparent without the barrier of hair, making you hyper-aware of the cool air brushing against your skin.

<<say $companionMaru>>But you look so clean! Like a polished stone or a shelled egg! I think it's really nice.<</say>>
Maru's words come out in excited bursts, his wide-eyed fascination with your transformation infectious. His head tilts to one side, his own shaggy hair falling across his eyes, forming a stark contrast to your own now immaculate brows. His cheeks flush with a hint of pink as he continues to study your new appearance, clearly intrigued by the change.

<<say $mc>>Well, if you think it's nice, then I suppose it can't be all that bad. It's just going to take some getting used to.<</say>>
You manage a small smile, your fingers absently tracing the smooth skin of your arm. Despite the strangeness of the change, Maru's endearing enthusiasm brings a sense of lightness to the situation.

:: Maru Maximum Fluff

You sit, back against the rough bark of a massive tree, your new fur-covered skin prickling against the coarse texture. A myriad of chirps, calls and rustles fill the air, painting a lively portrait of the rainforest around you.

<<say $companionMaru>>You look... different, you know? Like a cute, fuzzy...um, creature!<</say>>
Maru's wide eyes, reflecting the sunlight in a soft shine, look at you with a mixture of awe and curiosity. His small fingers reach out to touch your fur, hesitating slightly in the air.

You nod, giving him a reassuring smile. The $curse19.variation fur on your body, soft and surprisingly warm, has become a part of your new existence in the Abyss.

<<say $mc>>Feels strange, doesn't it?<</say>>
You extend your arm towards him, inviting him to touch.

Maru's face brightens as he reaches out and carefully brushes his fingers through your fur. His touch is light and tentative, like that of a child petting a kitten for the first time.

<<say $companionMaru>>It's super fluffy! Like, really, really fluffy. It's like touching a cloud... but it's you!<</say>>
He giggles, a sound much brighter and more cheerful than the dim miasmal light that penetrates the dense foliage surrounding you.

You chuckle softly, ruffling the fur on your arm. It's an odd sensation - to be covered in fur, to feel each strand move as if it's part of you. It's even stranger to see Maru's reaction - his innocent delight, his pure fascination with your transformation.

<<say $mc>>I never thought I'd turn into a living plush toy in the Abyss.<</say>>
You say with a laugh.

Maru's laughter joins yours, echoing in the lush greenery of the Abyss. The sound is a bright note against the gentle hum of the rainforest, a poignant reminder of the strange and unpredictable journey you're on.

<<say $companionMaru>>But you're the cutest plush toy, right? Like a... a special Abyss edition!<</say>>
His giggle punctuates the sentence, and you can't help but join in his infectious laughter.

:: Maru Comic Relief

The caverns of the third layer of the Abyss radiate an eerie, ethereal glow, casting long, shivering shadows on the walls. Strange, almost bioluminescent plants bask in the dim light, their colors a muted array of purples and blues. A soft, echoing drip-drip-drip of water resonates throughout the vast expanse, the only sign of life in this otherwise desolate space.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh my! Look at you!<</say>>
Maru's voice is bright and cheerful, bouncing off the cave walls, a stark contrast to the somber quiet. He's a small figure in the vastness of the cavern, his youthful face glowing with an innocent curiosity. His big, round eyes are wide open, a glimmer of amusement dancing in them as he stares directly at you.

<<say $mc>>What? Is there something on my face?<</say>>
You reach up to touch your face, your movements seeming exaggerated, comically clumsy, to any observer. The stones under your feet seem to wobble, or maybe it's just your newfound apparent awkwardness.

<<say $companionMaru>>No, no! It's not that, silly! It's just... you're so... so... funny!<</say>>
He tries to stifle a giggle, a hand over his mouth, but the sound escapes anyway, bouncing off the walls of the cave. His other hand points at you, wiggling in an attempt to contain his mirth.

<<say $mc>>Funny? I'm not trying to be funny.<</say>>
You try to maintain your dignity, but your voice seems to rise in a squeaky protest. A sudden gust of wind from deeper within the Abyss catches your cloak, making it flutter dramatically around you, making it seem as if you nearly lose your balance on the rocks you stand on, narrowly avoiding a fall.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh no, no! Not 'funny' like that! It's just... you're so different! Like a big, silly, clownfish!<</say>>
He giggles again, his voice resonating in the cavern, making the soft glow from the nearby fungi flicker in response. His eyes are alight with mirth, the corners crinkling as he laughs, and you can't help but be drawn into his infectious joy.

But somehow it still feels strange, that this is how everyone will always see you from now on.

:: Maru Crossdress Your Heart Male

Shimmering crystals of frost cling to the edges of your new attire as you trudge through the snowy wilderness of the Abyss's fourth layer. The biting chill wraps around your legs, made bare by the knee-length skirt you now wear. You're surprised to find the boots, despite their high heels, to be quite practical for navigating the deep snow. You glance down at your new attire, a mixture of consternation and acceptance flickering across your face.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh, oh! Look at you, all pretty and stuff!<</say>>
Maru exclaims, his eyes sparkling with delight as they rake over your appearance. His voice, high-pitched and filled with an infectious cheer, cuts through the icy air. The fluffy scarf around his neck flutters as he jumps in excitement, a striking contrast to the stark, frigid landscape surrounding you.

His cheeks, rosy from the cold, brighten even more as he giggles, wrapping his mittened hands around his mouth. His long eyelashes flicker like butterfly wings, drawing attention to his shining eyes, which are almost the same color as the snowflakes falling around you.

<<say $mc>>Well, I guess this is a new look for me.<</say>>
Looking down at yourself, your voice is filled with both amusement and resignation.

<<say $mc>>Do you think it suits me?<</say>>
Maru's tiny gasp echoes in the silence before his face breaks into a smile, one that seems to warm up the frosty air around you.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh, absolutely!<</say>>
He claps his hands together in a display of obvious joy.

<<say $companionMaru>>It's like...like you've always belonged in these clothes. And the color! It brings out your eyes perfectly! You're absolutely, positively adorable!<</say>>
He spins around in the snow, his own dress flaring out around him, his laughter filling the the otherwise quiet, snow-covered expanse of the Abyss's fourth layer. The sparkle in his eyes as he looks at you again is unmistakable. His cute and charming demeanor, juxtaposed against the harsh environment, provides at least a little bit of comfort in this harsh environment.

:: Maru Crossdress Your Heart Female

The icy winds of the Abyss's fourth layer nip at your exposed face as you adjust the collar of your new attire. The rough texture of the male adventurer's clothes is a stark contrast to the silken dresses you're accustomed to. You feel the solid weight of the sturdy leather boots, providing a firm grip on the snowy landscape, and the warmth of the thick trousers against the cold. You glance down, observing the change in your attire with a furrowed brow.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh my, look at you!<</say>>
Maru exclaims, his voice a lively lilt in the otherwise harsh and silent landscape. His eyes are wide with surprise and curiosity as he takes in your new appearance. His lips part in a small 'o' of amazement, the fluffy scarf around his neck bobbing in time with his words.

<<say $companionMaru>>You look... different, but it's a good kind of different!<</say>>
He claps his mittened hands together, the sound muffled but distinct in the wintry air. His eyes, as clear and bright as the frosty landscape around you, sparkle with intrigue and excitement.

<<say $mc>>I suppose I do look a little different.<</say>>
A hint of amusement tinging your tone as you run your fingers over the rough fabric of your shirt.

<<say $mc>>Do you think it suits me?<</say>>
Maru's giggle echoes around you, the sound carrying a warmth that seems to temper the bitter cold.

<<say $companionMaru>>It really does!<</say>>
He insists, his cheeks reddening further from more than just the chill.

<<say $companionMaru>>You look so cool, so strong! It's like you're ready to take on the whole Abyss by yourself!<</say>>
He twirls around, his own dress fanning out around him, and the sight brings a smile to your face. His laughter, light and clear, rings out through the icy expanse, a beacon of joy and positivity in the desolate landscape.

:: Maru Flower Power

The sweltering heat of the desert in the fifth layer of the Abyss pressed down on you, causing the flowers and vines woven through your body to release a gentle, sweet aroma that mixes with the dry air. The petals replacing your hair fluttered slightly in the occasional breeze, a vibrant contrast against the monotonous sandy dunes around you.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh my, look at you, all floral and blooming! You're just like a desert flower, right? All pretty and resilient.<</say>>
Maru's eyes sparkled with innocent fascination, his own delicate features accentuated by his cute feminine attire. He reached out a soft hand, tracing the path of a creeping vine on your arm with a touch as light as a butterfly landing on the petal of a flower.

<<say $mc>>It's a bit of a shock, isn't it? Not exactly what I expected when we started this journey.<</say>>
You tried to keep your tone light, but the truth of your transformation was still a bit unsettling.

<<say $companionMaru>>Shock? Oh no, not at all! You're more... um, unique now! And I think you're still very you, just with a bit of... um, flower power!<</say>>
Maru giggled at his own words. His gaze was full of genuine admiration, a testament to the kindness in his heart. He seemed to see past the oddity of your transformation, to the person you remained underneath the floral facade.

<<say $mc>>Well, I'm glad you think so, Maru. It's good to know at least one of us isn't completely freaked out by this.<</say>>
Maru's laugh echoed around you, a comforting sound against the otherwise barren surroundings.

:: Saeko Flower Power

The heat of the fifth layer of the Abyss is relentless, the harsh miasmal light beating down on the hard-packed desert sand. The wind kicks up sporadically, sending tiny shards of glass-like sand skittering across the expanse. You're standing there, your body transformed by the strange conditions of this place. What were once human features have morphed into something akin to a walking garden, flowers blooming across your skin and vines creeping along your limbs. Your hair, now a vibrant array of leaves and petals, rustles with each gust of wind, releasing a sweet, almost intoxicating scent into the dry air.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Fascinating... I've never seen a transformation quite like this. How do you feel?<</say>>
Saeko, your academic companion, squints at you from behind her rectangular glasses. Her eyes, sharp and analytical, flit over your altered form, taking in every detail. A small notebook is clutched in her hand, her pen rapidly scratching across the pages.

<<say $mc>>It feels... strange. Not bad, just... different.<</say>>
You're surprised to find your voice is the same, not changed to some sort of floral trill. You run your fingers over the petals sprouting from your skin, their soft, velvety texture unfamiliar yet oddly comforting.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Hmm, from a biological perspective, this is truly remarkable. I wonder... does the pollination process occur?<</say>>
Saeko's scientific curiosity is fully awakened. You can see her mind working behind her glasses, pondering over possible explanations and theories. Her fingers twitch, as if longing to pluck a sample from you.

<<say $mc>>Do you really think I could be pollinated by a plant?<</say>>
The thought of, well, breeding with a plant seemed strange to you, yet somehow within the realm of possibility.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I suspect not, as we haven't seen any fruits or seeds from you yet. But it's hard to say without testing it. Do you want to try?<</say>>
Her words, though seeming to be cold, hold a subtle undercurrent of concern. Despite her scientific excitement, Saeko's gaze softens slightly when she looks at you. And when you shake your head in response to her question, she nods and doesn't press the issue.

:: Saeko Carapacian

The surface of your new exoskeleton glistens under the harsh sunlight and you can feel the surprisingly cool sensation of your new carapace over your body, a strangely comforting sensation amidst the dry, scorching landscape.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Fascinating...<</say>>
Saeko mutters under her breath, her gaze locked onto you. She's been observing you like this for the past few minutes, her academic curiosity piqued.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Your exoskeleton's structure is extraordinary.<</say>>
You turn to look at her, a mixture of unease and curiosity in your eyes. The heat doesn't seem to bother Saeko as much, or if it does, she hides it well behind her thick-rimmed glasses and the scribbled notes in her hand.

<<say $mc>>It feels almost like armor, I guess.<</say>>
Saeko nods, her pen dancing across her notepad. Despite the situation, you can't help but appreciate her dedication to her studies.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Armor is an apt analogy. The exoskeleton of an insect is primarily for protection and support. Yours seems to function similarly. I'm curious though, how does it feel at the joints? There appears to be some elasticity there.<</say>>
You move your arm, feeling the natural give at the elbow. The sensation is not unlike wearing a well-fitted, lightweight glove.

<<say $mc>>It's flexible, like a second skin. And it's a bit cooler than the rest of me, which is... nice, considering the heat.<</say>>
Saeko smiles faintly, a look of pride and admiration hidden behind her scientific fascination. It's clear that she cares about you, even if she expresses it through her academic lens.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Remarkable... an adaptive thermoregulatory function as well. This change, while unexpected, is providing us with invaluable data. You're not just surviving the Abyss, you're evolving with it.<</say>>

:: Saeko Lingual Leviathan

The bitter wind of the fourth layer of the Abyss covers an unending canvas of white, a stark contrast to the dark mouth of the cave you and Saeko are currently seeking refuge in.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Extraordinary! The morphological changes you've undergone are fascinating.<</say>>
Her breath forms a plume of fog in the freezing air as she studies you with keen eyes, a scientific curiosity lighting up her features despite the cold.

<<say $mc>>Not exactly the word I'd use, Saeko.<</say>>
Your voice sounds strange to your own ears now, somewhat muffled due to your elongated tongue which takes up more space in your mouth than it used to.

Saeko steps closer, her gloved hand reaching out tentatively towards your face.

<<say $companionSaeko>>May I?<</say>>
A question of consent, her respect for your personal boundaries outweighing her academic curiosity.

<<say $mc>>Go ahead.<</say>>
The words seem to twist around your unwieldy tongue.

Saeko's gloved fingers brush against your lower lip, a shockingly warm contrast against the cold of the Abyss. As you part your lips, she gazes at the transformed organ with wide-eyed fascination.

<<say $companionSaeko>>The musculature and length are beyond the scope of any human norm. Yet you seem to be adapting, able to speak despite the obvious hindrance. And every time you speak it seems to be less of an issue than before. It's... It's absolutely remarkable.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>It doesn't feel remarkable. It feels... weird. I'm struggling to avoid biting it.<</say>>
The corners of Saeko's mouth twitch upwards, a rare smile in this frozen landscape.

<<say $companionSaeko>>An understandable reaction. But the Abyss is a place of change. You should probably have expected things like this when you decided to come down here. Let's take this as an opportunity to study, understand, and adapt.<</say>>
Her hand falls away, and you find yourself missing the brief human contact in the frigid expanse of this layer.

<<say $mc>>Right, the scientist in her element.<</say>>
You can't help the touch of sarcasm in your voice.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Indeed. But remember, you're not alone in this. We're in this together, navigating the unknown.<</say>>
Her words, earnest and sincere, hang in the freezing air. And as you continue your conversation, your words become less clear as you adapt to the change that took place within your mouth.

:: Saeko Cold Blooded

As you wander through the frigid expanse of the fourth layer, Saeko moves closer to you, her eyes filled with curiosity. As she extends a gloved hand towards you, her breath hitches slightly. Her fingers make contact with your arm, and a flash of surprise crosses her face.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Your body heat... it's negligible. Far below what I would expect, even given the cold environment.<</say>>
Her tone is analytical and laced with curiosity, her scientific mind intrigued by the unexpected discovery.

<<say $mc>>I'm feeling colder, yes. I have to keep moving to stay warm. It's like the cold is inside me, not just around me.<</say>>
Your voice sounds strange to your own ears, the words coming out with more difficulty than you expected. The cold seems to be sapping your strength, your muscles aching with the effort of maintaining your body temperature.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Fascinating. Your body has adopted an ectothermic state, similar to some reptilian species. You're dependent on external heat sources now.<</say>>
Saeko's eyes light up, her scientific curiosity clearly piqued. She quickly pulls her hand back, her brow furrowing in thought.

<<say $mc>>Does that mean I'm a lizard now?<</say>>
Your attempt at levity falls flat, the cold seeming to sap not just your warmth but your sense of humor as well.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Not exactly. Your physiological responses have changed, certainly, but your genetic makeup remains the same. You're still a human... just a cold one.<</say>>
Saeko's words are clinical, detached, but you catch the faintest hint of concern in her voice. The snowfall around you provides a stark contrast to the warmth of her presence in this icy layer of the Abyss.

:: Saeko Gooey

The dim caverns of the third layer of the Abyss echo with the slow drip of water and the faint rustle of unseen creatures. The walls, slick with condensation, reflect the pale glow of luminescent fungi, casting an eerie, otherworldly light on your gooey form. Your sticky, slimy figure, once human, is now a shimmering $app.skinColor, reflecting the surreal colors around you.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I must admit, your current physiological state is truly... fascinating. I've read about changes like this, but to see it in action is another matter entirely.<</say>>
Saeko's eyes, wide with curiosity and a hint of concern, study your form. Her gaze is clinical, inquisitive, as she stretches a hand to gently touch your arm. The contact sends a peculiar sensation rippling through your gelatinous form, neither pain nor pleasure, but something altogether foreign.

<<say $mc>>Does it bother you, Saeko? My... transformation?<</say>>
The faintest trace of a blush tints Saeko's cheeks, but she quickly regains her composure, shaking her head. Her fingers, though retracted, leave a faint, tingling trail on your arm.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Not at all. It is... different, yes, but it's a testament to the transformative properties of the Abyss. You've become something out of a theoretical paper, a living embodiment of adaptation and survival.<</say>>
Saeko's voice echoes in the dim cavern, a soft counterpoint to the haunting silence. She brushes a stray lock of hair from her face, her expression one of focused fascination. Her fingers twitch, longing to note down observations, but her gaze never leaves you.

<<say $mc>>I'm glad you're taking it well. I was afraid you'd be... well, afraid.<</say>>
Saeko smiles then, her eyes softening as she looks at you. The academic veneer momentarily slips away, revealing the gentle concern lurking beneath her curiosity.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Your wellbeing is important to me. It's not just about the science, you know. But, I must admit, I can't help but find this... change... intriguing.<</say>>
Saeko's words hang in the air, echoing the sentiment in her eyes. Her scientific fascination with your transformation, though prominent, is tempered by genuine care and concern. She takes a step back, a silent promise to respect your space and boundaries, as you begin to continue your journey onwards.

:: Saeko 20/20000000

The dimly lit caverns of the third layer of the Abyss cast an eerie greenish hue, accentuated by the soft bioluminescent flora growing on the cavern walls. The occasional drip of water from the stalactites above punctuating the eerie silence of the caves.

<<say $companionSaeko>> Your eyesight... it's been noticeably worse since yesterday, hasn't it?<</say>>
Saeko's words hang in the air as she inspects you, her own red glasses reflecting the ambient glow. Her eyes, sharp and analytical, skim over you, the clinical gaze of a scientist dissecting a new phenomenon.

<<say $mc>>Yes, it's been quite... challenging. I can barely see past my own hand without these.<</say>>
You motion to the unstylish glasses perched on your nose, their thick lenses amplifying the cavern's light into your eyes. There's a slight discomfort, a small reminder of your newfound sensitivity.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Fascinating. The Abyss has a way of exaggerating our vulnerabilities, doesn't it?<</say>>
Her voice is calm, her scientific curiosity outpacing any underlying concern. She lifts her notebook, the worn leather cover illuminated by the bioluminescence around you. Her hand is steady as she jots down her observations, her red glasses slipping slightly down her nose.

<<say $mc>>I suppose it does. Though, I can't say I find it as fascinating as you do.<</say>>
Your voice carries a hint of amusement, watching as Saeko's eyes light up with the thrill of discovery. You adjust your glasses, the frames uncomfortably foreign against your skin.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Do the glasses help at all?<</say>>
She looks at you again, her gaze flickering with a strange mix of academic interest and something more personal, a hint of care buried under layers of scientific objectivity.

<<say $mc>>They do, somewhat. But it's... strange. I've never had to rely on them before.<</say>>
Saeko nods, chewing on her bottom lip in thought, her hands instinctively adjusting her own glasses.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Keep observing the changes, and let me know if anything else occurs. We must understand the effects better if we are to properly manage them.<</say>>
Her words are logical, practical, and yet, underneath it all, you can't help but sense a hint of worry, a crack in her scientific armor.

:: Saeko Increased Sensitivity
The first layer of the Abyss unfurls around you in an spectacle of slightly alien plant life. The air, thick with the scent of unknown flora, fills your lungs with an intoxicating sweetness. The shadows cast by the towering plants dance and sway. You can feel the tickle of the wind on your recently sensitized skin.

<<say $companionSaeko>>You've been acting differently since yesterday, you know. Unusual physiological responses, heightened skin reactivity, and your pupils are noticeably dilated... It's fascinating.<</say>>
Saeko's observant gaze scrutinizes you, her dark eyes reflecting the miasmal light of the Abyss. She removes a pair of gloves from her bag, her fingers meticulous and precise.

<<say $mc>>I can't deny it, Saeko. It's like every nerve ending is on high alert. Even the smallest touch...<</say>>
Your voice trails off, the sensation of your clothes brushing against your skin proving to be a continuous source of distraction.

Saeko nods, her analytical mind whirring with theories and hypotheses. She steps closer, her every move deliberate and calculated.

<<say $companionSaeko>>May I?<</say>>
Her voice is steady, but there's a hint of curiosity, an eagerness to understand that softens her normally stern demeanor.

<<say $mc>>Sure, just... be gentle.<</say>>
A small smile tugs at the corner of your lips, a mix of anticipation and anxiety coursing through you.

Saeko, with your consent, reaches out to brush a gloved hand across <<if $app.breastsCor > 0 >>your breasts<<elseif $app.penisCor > 0>>your bulge<<else>>your sensitive regions<</if>>. The sensation, although mild, sends a thrilling shiver down your spine, making your breath hitch. Saeko's eyes widen slightly, her brow furrowing in intrigue.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Remarkable... Your responses are akin to extreme tactile hyperesthesia, but you don't seem to be in pain. Quite the contrary.<</say>>
She withdraws her hand slowly, her gaze following the lingering trail of goosebumps on your skin.

<<say $mc>>It's... overwhelming, to be honest.<</say>>
Your words hang in the air, the mesmerizing beauty of the Abyss serving as a backdrop to the odd intimacy of this moment.

Her gaze meets yours again, the academic in her wrestling with the concern for a friend. Despite the mystifying allure of the Abyss, the unique transformation you're undergoing is equally, if not more, captivating to her.

s you wander through the sixth layer, perpetual crimson haze hangs in the air, obscuring the distant twisted formations and bathing everything in a hellish glow. The faint scent of sulfur permeates the atmosphere, filling your nostrils with its pungent aroma.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I noticed some physiological changes in you, most interestingly your... increased fluid production. It appears the Abyss has affected you in quite a unique manner.<</say>>
Saeko's voice echoes in the eerie silence of the Abyss, her cool analytical demeanor in stark contrast with the infernal surroundings. She adjusts her glasses, her eyes scanning you with scientific curiosity.

<<say $mc>>It's... uncomfortable. But I suppose it could be worse. At least it doesn't hurt.<</say>>
Your voice cracks slightly, betraying your discomfort. You feel the trickle of fluid down your thighs, the perpetual slickness an unusual sensation that hasn't ceased since the transformation.

Saeko nods, scribbling something in her notepad. She's always been more comfortable with her research than interpersonal relations. Yet, there's a furrow in her brow and a slight crease in her normally composed expression.

<<say $companionSaeko>>It's indeed quite fascinating from a biological standpoint. The increased fluid production could potentially indicate heightened fertility, but it's hard to say without further examination. I wonder if...<</say>>
She hesitates, her gaze meeting yours for a moment before dropping to her notepad again. It's clear she's trying to navigate the strange intersection between her academic curiosity and her concern for you.

<<say $mc>>I appreciate the offer, Saeko. But for now, let's just focus on getting through the Abyss. I can deal with the... changes.<</say>>
Her gaze softens, the corners of her lips twitching upwards in a small, understanding smile. As the two of you continue your arduous journey, the acrid smell of the Abyss mingles with the distinct scent of your new, unusual fluids

:: Saeko Minish-ish

The cityscape around you hums with a quiet, artificial life. Neon lights flicker and shimmer in the polished chrome buildings, casting shades of cobalt and electric pink across the deserted streets. Your gaze can only just reach the bases of these towering monoliths from your new, downscaled perspective. The normally gentle thrum of electricity running through the city now sounds like the deafening roar of a waterfall to your sensitive, miniaturized ears.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Fascinating... The phenomena of the Abyss never cease to astonish me.<</say>>
Saeko murmurs, carefully adjusting her glasses. She's crouched down, her piercing gaze fixed on you. From your current height, she seems as colossal as the surrounding architecture.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I hope you're not feeling any discomfort. The sudden decrease in size must have been... quite a shock.<</say>>
You feel your feet lift off the cold metal surface beneath you as Saeko gingerly lifts you off the ground, places you in her palm, and raises you to eye level. The world sways beneath you with the slight, controlled tremor of her hand. Her face, framed by the neon glow of the city, displays a mixture of concern and curiosity.

<<say $mc>>It's a bit weird, to be honest, Saeko. Everything is so... loud. So big.<</say>>
Your voice sounds tinny and strange to your own ears. The city's hum, already loud, grows deafening as you speak, as if your words were competing with the city's synthetic heartbeat.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Indeed, your sensory perception must be radically different. I wonder how this change will impact our understanding of the Abyss... And of course, how it will affect our expedition.<</say>>
She frowns, her brow furrowing in deep thought.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Adaptation will be critical. I'll need to devise some method of transportation for you.<</say>>
With a soft smile, she places you gently into a pocket of her coat, providing a temporary refuge from the overbearing city sounds. The fabric mutes the harsh neon lights, casting a soothing, dim glow around you. Saeko's heartbeat, steady and rhythmic, provides a comforting backdrop to the city's clamor.

<<say $mc>>I appreciate your help, Saeko. It's... unsettling, this change. But I'm glad you're here with me.<</say>>
In the darkness of her pocket, the world doesn't seem so overwhelmingly large, and your journey through the Abyss, though changed, seems a little less daunting.

:: Saeko Colossal-able

As you wander through the seventh layer, your colossal form casts an even more massive shadow that stretches out in the city's lights, consuming entire blocks in its inky expanse.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Your transformation is quite... extraordinary, isn't it?<</say>>
Saeko gazes up at you, her wide eyes reflecting the neon glow of the city. Despite the awe-inspiring sight of your towering form, her voice maintains the calm, methodical tone of a dedicated scientist, as if she were observing an intriguing specimen in her laboratory.

<<say $mc>>It's been difficult to adjust, but I'm managing.<</say>>
Your voice rumbles down to her like distant thunder, your breath stirring up small gusts of wind that ruffle her hair.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Indeed. I can only imagine the challenges you face, both biomechanically and physiologically. The sheer increase in mass must be causing a significant increase in your energy requirements.<</say>>
She taps a finger against her chin, her gaze lost in thought as she studies you. Her analytical side is clearly captivated, viewing your situation through the lens of a researcher.

<<say $mc>>You're right. I've been feeling hungrier than usual.<</say>>
Your massive hand moves to rub at your stomach, the action causing nearby structures to tremble slightly with your movements.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I suspected as much. I'll start modifying our food supplies accordingly. But, it's not just the physical changes we have to consider. There are also psychological implications to such a drastic alteration.<</say>>
The corners of her lips pull into a tight line, her gaze softening slightly as she looks up at you. Her scientific curiosity is still present, but you can also see a hint of concern in her eyes.

<<say $mc>>What do you mean?<</say>>
Your brows furrow in confusion, the action causing a ripple to move through the skin on your forehead.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Changes of this magnitude can affect one's perception and cognition. This new perspective, the change in your body schema, it could potentially impact your spatial awareness and even your sense of self.<</say>>
Her voice is steady, but there's a note of unease underlying her words. It's clear that she is worried about more than just the physical implications of your transformation. 

<<say $mc>>You think it could affect my mind?<</say>>
A slight tremble enters your voice, betraying your apprehension. The towering buildings seem to sway sympathetically with you as you tower over them, a lonely giant in a city built for smaller beings.

<<say $companionSaeko>>It's a possibility we cannot ignore, yes. But remember, we're in this together. We'll observe, adapt, and overcome, just as we've always done.<</say>>
She squares her shoulders and looks up at you with a determined expression.

<<say $mc>>Thank you. That's comforting, Saeko.<</say>>
Despite your colossal size, her words manage to provide some solace. Your huge hand gently pats the ground beside her, an attempt at a reassuring gesture on a scale that the city has never witnessed before.

:: Maru Horny

The air was thick with sulfur, yet it was not completely unpleasant, the scent strangely comforting as it seemed to emphasize the alien yet powerful aspect of your recent transformation.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh my gosh, just look at you!<</say>>
Maru's voice was a soft, excited squeal, his eyes wide and sparkling as they took in your new appearance. The young man, clad in a frilly dress, clutched his hands together, bouncing on his toes in his excitement.

The corners of your mouth twitched upwards in an amused smile, your fingers reaching up to trace the intricate patterns of the horn protruding from your forehead. It was a strange sensation, the horn warm and surprisingly sensitive to touch.

<<say $mc>>"It's quite the change, isn't it?"<</say>>
You tilt your head to allow Maru a better view.

Maru nodded vigorously, his twin tails of vibrant hair bobbing along with his movements. He moved closer, his curious gaze flitting between your eyes and the towering horn that adorned your head.

<<say $companionMaru>><<if $hornVariation == "draconic">>It's like... like you're a real-life dragon now! <<elseif $hornVariation == "demonic">> It's like... like you're a real-life demon now! <<elseif $hornVariation == "unicorn">>It's like... like you're a real-life unicorn now! <</if>>It's so, so amazing! It really suits you, you know?<</say>>
Maru gushed, his cheeks flushed with excitement, a stark contrast to the dim, ominous backdrop of the hellish tentacle-scape you're wandering through.

You let out a chuckle, patting the young man's head affectionately. His excitement was infectious, and you found yourself growing fond of your new appendage, as odd as it was.

<<say $mc>>Thank you, Maru. It's not every day you wake up with a $hornVariation horn, but I think I can get used to it.<</say>>
Maru's giggles echoed around you, a sweet melody against the low rumble of the sixth layer around you.

:: Cherry Shrunken Assets

The alien beauty of the first layer is a stark contrast to the bleakness in Cherry's dull eyes as she gazes at you. She sits on a mossy outcrop, her knees drawn up to her chest, and her chin resting on her folded arms.

<<say $companionCherry>>You look... different today, don't you?<</say>>
Her voice is barely above a whisper, as if she's afraid to disrupt the tranquil atmosphere around you.

You glance down at your newly transformed body, feeling a bit self-conscious due to the changes. The clothes that used to fit snugly now hang a little loose, emphasizing the transformation.

<<say $mc>>Different how?<</say>>
You try to sound nonchalant, but your voice betrays a hint of anxiety.

Cherry remains silent for a moment, her expression impassive, as if she's carefully selecting her next words. Her thin fingers idly trace an intricate pattern on the mossy ground.

<<say $companionCherry>>Less... substantial, I guess.<</say>>
She seems to hesitate in her response, as if trying to phrase it in a way that is least likely to upset you. You instinctively fold your arms over your chest, an attempt to hide the changes from her and from yourself. But it's a futile gesture. The sensation of emptiness is a constant reminder of the Curse you've obtained.

<<say $mc>>Do you think it makes me less... desirable?<</say>>
The words slip out before you can stop them, but there is an earnest curiosity underlying your question.

She raises her head, her gaze meeting yours. For a moment, her eyes flicker with something akin to surprise, before the familiar veil of apathy settles back in.

<<say $companionCherry>>That... would depend on who you're trying to appeal to, wouldn't it?<</say>>
Her voice holds an unusual note of softness.

<<say $companionCherry>>But you're still you, no matter how your appearance changes. Isn't that what matters most in the end?<</say>>
Her words, though spoken with the same flatness as always, carry a strange sense of comfort.

:: Cherry Double Pepperoni

After a long day of hiking through the caves, you sit, resting after the day's exhausting adventure, your shirt feeling peculiarly tight around your chest.

<<say $companionCherry>>You seem... different today. Is it... the Abyss doing its thing again?<</say>>
Her voice, typically monotonous, carries a hint of curiosity, pulling her from her usual state of resignation. Her weary eyes, once dull, now glimmer with a spark of interest as they cast a fleeting glance at your chest.

<<say $mc>>It appears so. Changes are inevitable down here, aren't they?<</say>>
Your words hang in the air, mingling with the damp chill of the cave. You feel a pang of sensitivity, your skin tingling under her gaze. Unconsciously, your arms fold across your chest, attempting to conceal the unusual swelling.

<<say $companionCherry>>They say... change is the only constant in the Abyss. It's kind of... ironic, isn't it?<</say>>
A hint of a smile tugs at the corners of her lips, a rare sight that adds a touch of warmth to her otherwise cold demeanor. Cherry, in her resigned acceptance of the Abyss's peculiarities, has found a strange semblance of humor in it.

<<say $mc>>I suppose it is. I guess we just have to roll with it.<</say>>
Your voice wavers slightly, but you manage to maintain a playful tone. For a moment, the sense of discomfort from your transformation fades, replaced with an odd feeling of camaraderie.

<<say $companionCherry>>Roll with it... yeah, I can do that.<</say>>
Her voice drifts off as her gaze flits back to the flickering glow of the bioluminescent fungi.

:: Cherry Megadontia

The arctic winds of the Abyss whip around you, a chilling symphony of whistles and howls. The fourth layer is a desolate, snowy landscape stretching far into the horizon, a world cloaked in white and blue. Your breath steams in the frosty air, crystallizing in front of your face. Your new teeth, unnaturally sharp and prominent, feel awkward in your mouth, especially the ones that extend beyond your lips.

<<say $companionCherry>>You look... different today.<</say>>
Cherry murmurs, her voice barely audible over the shrill wind. Her eyes, usually dull and void of emotion, flicker with a trace of curiosity as they focus on your mouth. She brushes a strand of frosty hair from her face, her gaze unwavering.

<<say $companionCherry>>Your smile... It's scary now, but oddly... interesting.<</say>>
Her words hang in the air, and the faintest ghost of a smile flickers across her lips. It's a rare show of emotion that fades as quickly as it comes. The snowfall seems to soften around her, the flakes drifting gently onto her red hair and pale shoulders.

<<say $mc>>Scary, huh? I suppose it's a bit much. But I'll get used to it, won't I?<</say>>
Your words are punctuated by a sharp click as your teeth come together, an unfamiliar sound that echoes in the empty expanse. Cherry flinches ever so slightly, her eyebrows knitting together in a mixture of concern and... intrigue.

<<say $companionCherry>>Yeah. Maybe you will.<</say>>
She replies, her voice so soft it almost merges with the whispering wind.

<<say $companionCherry>>After all, we all change down here. Constantly. Unavoidably.<</say>>
Her eyes return to the vast emptiness in front of her, yet there's an unfamiliar spark in them. It's the subtlest hint of anticipation, or perhaps fascination. A small, almost imperceptible change in her demeanor.

<<say $companionCherry>>Maybe it's not so bad... for things to be a little different.<</say>>
She pulls her threadbare coat tighter around herself, the howling wind seemingly unfazed by her quiet resilience. The icy landscape might seem utterly devoid of warmth or comfort, yet, in that moment, there's a strange sense of camaraderie between you and Cherry. A shared understanding. A journey, not just through the Abyss, but through the changes it has wrought within you.

:: Cherry DoS

The blazing miasmal light casts a harsh glare on the arid dunes of the Abyss's fifth layer. The hot sand underfoot feels like a furnace, and even the air tastes of dust and dry heat. Amidst this inhospitable landscape, you stand, transformed by the Curse you obtained the day before.

<<say $companionCherry>>You look... different.<</say>>
Cherry's voice is as flat and unenthusiastic as ever, her eyes just as dim. She doesn't seem shocked or scared by your transformation; rather, her gaze is resigned, as though she had expected this all along.

<<say $mc>>Different how, Cherry? I don't believe I've changed physically at all.<</say>>
Your voice, now deeper and somehow crueler, echoes in the vast expanse of the desert, startling a small flock of birds into flight in the distance.

<<say $companionCherry>>Your eyes... they're not the same. They're colder... harsher.<</say>>
Cherry reaches out with a slender hand, her fingers brushing against your cheek in a fleeting touch. The action seems to take a great deal of her energy, and she quickly retracts her hand, letting it fall limply by her side.

<<say $mc>>Does it scare you?<</say>>
Your question hangs in the air, a dark amusement hidden in your words. Cherry doesn't reply immediately, her eyes darting away from yours to stare blankly at the horizon.

<<say $companionCherry>>No... Nothing really scares me anymore.<</say>>
She shrugs, the action looking so small and defeated in the vast, scorched desert. Then, she gives a small, wistful smile, the first hint of emotion you've seen on her face.

<<say $companionCherry>>But I liked your old eyes better. They were... kinder.<</say>>
Her words, though spoken in her usual, lifeless tone, carry a weight of melancholy and nostalgia. You feel a pang of something – regret, perhaps, or guilt – but it is quickly overtaken by the sadistic pleasure that the Curse brings, numbing your capacity for empathy. You find yourself enjoying the pain and loss that Cherry feels for the older version of yourself.

<<say $mc>>I'm still the same person, Cherry. I'm still with you.<</say>>
Your words sound hollow even to your own ears, the irony of the situation not lost on you.

:: Cherry Wandering Hands

The heat of the Abyss prickled against your skin, a grim reminder of the relentless hostility of this place. The infernal hellscape of the sixth layer stretched out before you, its hellish glare bouncing off Cherry's pallid complexion, making her look even more ghostly.

<<say $companionCherry>>What are you doing?<</say>>
Cherry's voice echoed, sounding as if it was swimming through the dense, hot air. Her eyes, usually vacant and distant, now held a flicker of interest as she watched your hand wander to her chest.

You paused, blinking at your own hand as if it was an alien thing. A blush spread across your face as you realized what you were doing.

<<say $mc>>I... uh, I didn't realize. I apologize, Cherry.<</say>>
Your voice wavered, embarrassment mixing with the odd sensation of your body acting on its own.

The corners of Cherry's lips twitched upwards in the faintest hint of a smile. It was such a rare sight that it almost seemed more shocking than your own action.

<<say $companionCherry>>It's okay... It's not like you were hurting me or anything.<</say>>
Her voice was as flat as ever, but there was a strange softness to it that you hadn't heard before.

Your hand, as if it had a mind of its own, began to move again, fingers brushing over the soft fabric of Cherry's dress, tracing the curve of her breasts. The heat of the Abyss seemed to intensify, your pulse thrumming loudly in your ears.

<<say $mc>>I can't... I can't seem to stop it.<</say>>
You confessed, your voice barely a whisper.

Cherry's gaze dropped to your hand, watching it with a detached fascination. For a moment, the desolate look in her eyes seemed to waver.

<<say $companionCherry>>I guess... it's just something we have to deal with here... in the Abyss.<</say>>
She murmured, but she didn't pull away, she didn't even seem to mind as you continued your ministrations until you decided to get moving once again.

:: Cherry Weakling

The gloomy neon lights of the seventh layer of the Abyss flicker erratically, casting long, jittery shadows across the deserted streets of the robotic cyberpunk city and creating a melancholic backdrop to your exploration.

<<say $companionCherry>>You seem to be struggling with that, you know?<</say>>
Cherry's voice is a flat monotone, as if she's commenting on the weather rather than your predicament. She's observing you trying to lift your pack, an item that used to be an effortless part of your journey.

A sigh escapes your lips, filled with frustration. The once easy task of lifting your backpack has turned into a Herculean effort, your muscles straining against the once manageable weight.

<<say $mc>>It's nothing, Cherry... just, having an off day, I guess.<</say>>
Your voice cracks a little, betraying the irritation and embarrassment you feel.

Her green eyes, usually so dull and void of life, flicker with something you've not seen before. They widen slightly, just a hint of surprise and curiosity seeping through her depressive fog. The neon cityscape reflects in her irises, painting an eerie picture of shifting lights and shadows.

<<say $companionCherry>>Off day? You've been having trouble with that since yesterday. You're... changing, aren't you?<</say>>
Her voice trails off, the last word hanging in the air like a tangible thing. She doesn't sound concerned or alarmed, more intrigued and slightly... amused? It can be hard to tell with Cherry.

You exhale, setting the backpack down. The relief in your muscles is almost immediate, but it's short-lived as you turn to face her. You meet her gaze, the neon light casting an unnatural glow on your face.

<<say $mc>>Maybe I am, Cherry. This is the Abyss after all. People change here.<</say>>
You try to make light of the situation, your voice filled with a forced cheeriness.

She doesn't respond immediately. She just stands there, observing you. Then, a tiny quirk of her lips appears, so quick you almost miss it. It's a stark contrast to her usual flat affect, a small, cute crack in her armor of indifference.

<<say $companionCherry>>I suppose that's true... just don't forget to ask for help if you need it, alright?<</say>>
Her voice is still flat, her words laced with resignation, but the hint of concern is there, buried beneath the layers of fatigue and depression.

:: Cloud Perma-dye

The first layer of the Abyss was a marvel of serene twilight, an eerie yet captivating spectacle. Unearthly trees reached high towards the dim-lit sky, their leaves rustling in a whispering breeze, and the air was crisp with a touch of metallic chill. You and Cloud had taken a moment to rest, your recent transformation rendering you a bit disoriented.

Your $curse7.variation colored hair, a stark contrast to the natural hues of this layer, added an exotic aura to your presence. The unique change was intriguing yet somewhat unsettling.

<<say $companionCloud>>Well, well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes? I always knew you had a spark, but this... This is a full-blown flame.<</say>>
Cloud reclined against an imposing tree, his eyes gleaming with a mix of mischief and admiration. He crossed his arms, his ruggedly handsome face lit by an easy grin, reflecting the playful twinkle in his eyes.

<<say $mc>>It's certainly a change, isn't it? I'm still getting used to it.<</say>>
You brushed your hand through your $curse7.variation colored hair, feeling the strands slide through your fingers, the visual reminder of the Abyss's peculiar influence.

<<say $companionCloud>>Change, my dear, is the essence of life. And you... you've become a glorious representation of that philosophy. You carry it with poise, like an artist's brushstroke on a canvas.<</say>>
Cloud's words resonated in the tranquil air, his voice rich with warmth. He moved to stand next to you, an embodiment of confidence against the backdrop of the Abyss, his eyes focused on the horizon but his thoughts, it seemed, were much closer.

<<say $companionCloud>>It's a symbol, don't you see? A symbol of transformation, adaptation. It's beautiful. You're beautiful.<</say>>
He turned to look at you, a sincere glow in his eyes that mirrored the earnestness in his words. His charismatic aura wove through the mystical environment, a unique portrait of a man dreaming yet firmly anchored in the reality of his vision. A new world, a better world, and you, at his side, evolving together with the Abyss.

:: Cloud Fluffy Tail

The canopy of the second layer stretched far above you, a dizzying array of greenery pierced by sharp shafts of sunlight. The air was thick with the smell of damp earth and the peculiar sweet aroma of unseen flowers. Your new tail, bushy and more akin to a $curse18.variation's than any other creature, twitched behind you. It was an unfamiliar feeling, the sensation of it brushing against your legs as you moved, a constant fluffy presence.

<<say $companionCloud>>Well, if it isn't the cutest adventurer in all the Abyss.<</say>>
Cloud's voice echoed from behind you, his tone playful yet laced with a hint of admiration.

You turned to find him leaning against a colossal tree trunk, arms folded across his chest. His eyes, sparkling with a hint of mischief, roved over your altered appearance. His lips curled into a teasing grin, one that accentuated his devilishly handsome features.

<<say $mc>>Is this how you greet everyone you travel with, or am I special?<</say>>
Cloud chuckled, a sound as smooth and enticing as a river's flow, pushing himself off the tree. His boots crunched on fallen leaves as he approached, the dappled sunlight from above casting intriguing shadows on his face.

<<say $companionCloud>>No, you're special, all right. You've got to admit, it's not every day you see someone sprout a fluffy tail. Especially one as charming as yours.<</say>>
A crimson blush blossomed on your cheeks, feeling the soft touch of his fingers brushing the fluffy tuft of your tail. A rush of unexpected sensation washed over you, making your heart beat a touch faster.

<<say $mc>>Charming, huh? Didn't know you're into tails, Cloud.<</say>>
Cloud laughed once more, his laughter echoing amidst the stillness of the forest. He lifted his gaze to meet yours, a knowing look in his eyes that only made your heart flutter more.

<<say $companionCloud>>I'm into a lot of things.<</say>>
He winked at you as he spoke.

<<say $companionCloud>>But most of all, I'm into seeing people embracing change. And you, my dear, you've managed to turn even a curse into an opportunity. That's more than charming, that's... enchanting.<</say>>
He offered you a soft, genuine smile, and for a moment, his playful facade fell away, revealing a glimpse of the heartfelt admiration beneath.

:: Cloud Submissiveness Rectification A

The air is cold and damp, filled with the echoing drips of water from stalactites in the third layer of the Abyss. Faint luminescent moss grows on the walls, casting an eerie glow that stretches across the shadowy expanse. You stand there, the eerie glow casting flickering shadows on you. But it's not your outward appearance that has changed the most - it's the shift in your demeanor, the newfound softness in your gaze, and the subtle yielding to Cloud's suggestions that marks the true transformation.

<<say $companionCloud>>Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes? I'm not sure what's happened, but you've got this alluring glow about you now. A charm that wasn't there yesterday.<</say>>
His voice, a harmonious blend of mischief and allure, echoes through the cavern. His eyes, lit up by the ethereal light, carry a glint of curiosity.

<<say $mc>>I... I feel different, Cloud. I'm not sure how to explain it, but I feel as though...I'm more inclined to listen to others, to go along with what they say.<</say>>
You admit, your voice echoing softly in the cold air of the Abyss.

Cloud chuckles, a warm, hearty sound that bounces off the stone walls, chasing away the eerie silence. He steps closer, his tall form silhouetted against the eerie green light of the cavern.

<<say $companionCloud>>Well, there's nothing wrong with a bit of... flexibility. It doesn't make you less. Remember, water can carve canyons over time. The strength of your spirit, the courage of your heart, they're all still there. If anything, you've become more versatile. More adaptable.<</say>>
His hand reaches out, gently brushing a stray lock of hair from your face. His touch is warm, contrasting the chilliness of the cavern around you. His fingers linger for a moment longer than necessary, a testament to his charismatic nature, and then he steps back, giving you space once again.

<<say $companionCloud>>You're still you, just a different shade. You're still the person I chose to venture into the Abyss with. And I believe in you, no matter what.<</say>>
His voice resonates with sincerity, reinforcing the bond you share as you explore the mysteries of the Abyss together, facing whatever changes and challenges it throws at you.

:: Cloud Lie Detector

Snowflakes danced in the air, glinting like tiny diamonds as they fluttered in the half-light of the Abyss's fourth layer. The cold cut through your clothing and left your breath hanging in the air like a spectral echo. You shivered, struggling to maintain a strong appearance despite your discomfort.

<<say $companionCloud>>You don't have to pretend it isn't freezing, you know.<</say>>
Cloud's words were almost lost in the icy wind, but his ever-present grin was as clear as ever against the stark white backdrop. His cobalt eyes studied you, amused, from beneath the hood of his cloak.

<<say $mc>>I'm fine, really.<</say>>
A laugh slipped from his lips, cutting through the quiet with a warmth that seemed alien in the frigid wasteland.

<<say $companionCloud>>You're a terrible liar, you know that, right?<</say>>
He watched you curiously, seemingly unaffected by the cold. His words didn't carry any harshness. Instead, they were lightly teasing, an extension of the playful charm that seemed to be at the core of his being.

<<say $mc>>I... I just didn't want to cause any trouble.<</say>>
There was a silence as Cloud's gaze softened, the mirth fading to reveal a flicker of understanding in his eyes.

<<say $companionCloud>>Hey, we're in this together. No need to sugarcoat things. If you're cold, you're cold.<</say>>
His words were simple, but they held a sincerity that resonated in the stark, icy quiet. His playful demeanor had faded for a moment, replaced by a sense of seriousness that matched the severity of the landscape around you.

<<say $mc>>Thank you, Cloud.<</say>>
Cloud's grin returned, brighter than before, and he winked at you.

<<say $companionCloud>>Don't mention it. Now, how about we get moving? We're not going to find the heart of the Abyss by freezing to death, are we?<</say>>

:: Cloud DoM

The scorching heat of the fifth layer's desert lashed at your exposed skin. The sensation was akin to dancing barefoot on hot coals, but instead of agony, an odd sense of pleasure began to unfurl within you, curling your lips into a twisted grin of delight.

<<say $companionCloud>>Interesting, I haven't seen that sort of smile on your face before.<</say>>
Cloud's voice, smooth as silk, cut through the crackle of the searing air. His striking green eyes sparkled, mirroring the miasmal light's relentless glow.

<<say $companionCloud>>You're enjoying basking in this tormenting heat, aren't you?<</say>>
His gaze was fixed on you, as if he was studying an exotic creature in its natural habitat. Despite the unbearable heat, his characteristic confidence didn't waver; instead, his charisma seemed to intensify, undeniably alluring like a mirage in the merciless desert.

<<say $mc>>Can't help it, Cloud. This heat... it's not torment for me anymore. It's... blissful.<</say>>
You murmur to him, your voice strained with the pleasure-pain that prickled along your nerve endings.

A slow smile curled his lips, his interest piqued. The stark contrast of your change, the adaptation in the Abyss, it seemed to fascinate him as much as it entranced you.

<<say $companionCloud>>You're starting to sound like a poet lost in her reverie. Didn't expect the unforgiving Abyss to bring out this side of you.<</say>>
He chuckles lightly, his eyes glinting with a roguish charm.

<<say $companionCloud>>It's strangely captivating. You're always full of surprises, aren't you?<</say>>
Despite the heat that turned your world into a scintillating blur, you were acutely aware of his presence as you continued your journey through the desert.

The crimson sky of the Abyss flickers as twisted and monstrous tendrils snake around the landscape, the ground throbbing with an ominous life of its own. The sanguine light casts an eerie glow onto the interior of your temporary camp. The shadows dance on the rippling walls of your tent, manifesting in bizarre, inky patterns.

<<say $companionCloud>>Well, well, look at you. You've got a new... spring in your step.<</say>>
Cloud observes you, his eyes twinkling with an inscrutable gleam. His voice is like warm silk, comforting yet undeniably provocative.

His observation doesn't escape you, the truth of it tingling just beneath your skin. You feel different; there's a softness about you that wasn't there before, an overwhelming urge to yield and obey. You sense Cloud's gaze lingering on your form, studying the changes in your demeanor and appearance.

<<say $mc>>Do I?<</say>>
Your voice feather-light and hesitant.

<<say $mc>>How... how so?<</say>>
Cloud grins, leaning back against the gnarled tentacle behind him. His lean frame cuts a dark silhouette against the luminous backdrop of the Abyss. The soft rustle of his clothing fills the quiet air as he gestures for you to come closer.

<<say $companionCloud>>You've always had fire, don't get me wrong. But there's a softer glow about you now. It's like a flower opening up... embracing the sun.<</say>>
Heat flushes your cheeks at his words, a sense of warmth blooming in your chest. His observations feel so intimate, like he's looking past your exterior and seeing something new and different within you.

<<say $mc>>Is... is that a bad thing?<</say>>
He takes a moment before answering, his gaze steady and deep as the Abyss itself.

<<say $companionCloud>>No, it's not a bad thing at all.<</say>>
He reassures you, then with a playful gleam in his eyes, he tilts his head and softly instructs.

<<say $companionCloud>>Come here.<</say>>
His voice is a whisper, echoing in the strange, breathing silence of your surroundings.

A subtle current, like a magnetic pull, compels you towards him. Your heart pounds in your chest as you respond to his command, an instinctual obedience that feels both foreign and familiar.

<<say $mc>>Okay.<</say>>
Your voice is barely above a whisper. You feel a soft thrill run down your spine as you rise to your feet, responding to his words with an uncharacteristic compliance.

Slowly, you cross the small distance between you and him, each step resonating with the hypnotic pulse of the sixth layer's tentacles. Your senses are attuned to Cloud's presence, and as you draw nearer, the earthy scent of his clothes mixes with the exotic odors of the Abyss, creating a heady blend that sends your heart fluttering.

<<say $companionCloud>>That's it... Easy now.<</say>>
He murmurs as you approach, his dark eyes softening with an unreadable emotion.

Once you're within arm's reach, he reaches out, and his hand gently brushes against your arm. The contact sends a wave of warmth coursing through you, intensifying the peculiar sensations brought on by your transformation. You can't help but lean into his touch, yearning for more.

<<say $companionCloud>>Look at you... Responding so willingly. It suits you.<</say>>
His words drip with a quiet authority that stirs something deep within you.

<<say $mc>>Does it?<</say>>
Your voice is small, filled with wonder and a strange acceptance.

Cloud's smile is soft, his eyes reflecting the eerie glow of the Abyss as he nods.

<<say $companionCloud>>Yes. It truly does.<</say>>
Cloud assures you, his voice a comforting rumble that grounds you amidst the alien strangeness of the Abyss.

:: Cloud Barter System

As you wander through the seventh layer, you notice Cloud giving you an odd look. His gaze lingers on you a moment longer before he moves to lean against a nearby wall, casting a quick glance around the desolate city.

<<say $companionCloud>>Let's talk about... how we're going to handle transactions when we get back up there.<</say>>
Cloud gestures vaguely upward, referencing the surface world you both had left behind.

He pauses, his gaze becoming more speculative as he studies you.

<<say $companionCloud>>You remember how we've always paid for things, right?<</say>>
His question hangs heavy in the air, despite the playful lilt to his tone.

<<say $mc>>Of course. What are you getting at, Cloud?<</say>>
Cloud chuckles, tipping his head back as a ripple of genuine laughter shakes his frame. When he recovers, his eyes are warm, his grin infectious.

<<say $companionCloud>>Well, when we get back to the surface, it seems like you'll have a whole new currency to work with.<</say>>
His smile fades a little, replaced by a thoughtful look.

<<say $companionCloud>>But be careful... it's a double-edged sword. And remember, every action has a reaction.<</say>>
The cryptic warning reverberates in the empty city, your mind whirling as you try to decode its meaning. You watch as Cloud moves away, his figure fading into the neon backdrop of the deserted cyberpunk city.

:: Lily Knife-ear

Your morning starts with an eerie glow filtering through the vast trees of the first layer of the Abyss, casting long shadows that add an uncanny allure to the surroundings. A light wind blows through the canopy above, making the leaves whisper hushed secrets to each other. Your sensitive elf ears catch every sound with an unusual clarity, their pointy tips twitching in response.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh my goodness! Just look at you! Those elf ears, they're like... wow! Just wow!<</say>>
Lily's wide eyes gleam with excitement, her voice lively and high-pitched. She eagerly steps closer, examining your pointed ears with a mix of curiosity and wonder. Her finger traces lightly over the shape of your ears, and you feel a jolt of sensitivity.

<<say $mc>>Hey! That's... kinda sensitive.<</say>>
You step back, cupping your ears instinctively. The sensation was overwhelming, but not entirely unpleasant.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh, sorry! I just got a little excited, you know. This place... it changes you in the most incredible ways! You now have these adorable elf ears, they make you look just like an anime character!<</say>>
She chuckles, her hands animated as she describes your new look, a playful glint lighting up her eyes. Lily's enthusiasm is infectious, and despite the strange situation you find yourself in, you find yourself laughing along with her.

<<say $mc>>Well, as long as I look like one of the good characters, I suppose I can handle that.<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>Oh, definitely! <<if $app.gender < 6 >>A handsome, mysterious elven warrior<<else>>A beautiful, mysterious elven princess<</if>>, perhaps? And just think about how much better your hearing is now. Every sound in this place must feel like a melody to your ears!<</say>>
She prances around you, singing a high-pitched tune and laughing as your ears twitch in response. She continues on her fantastical ramblings for a while as you get moving once again.

:: Lily Blushing Virgin

In the embrace of the rainforest's symphony, you let your mind wander. A tame, yet distinctly tantalizing fantasy had taken shape, a daydream that painted Lily, your eccentric companion, in a new, intimate light.

It began simply, a friendly shared glance over the firelight, the playful sparks in her eyes reflecting the vibrant glow of the flames. A touch of shared warmth as you both reached for the last piece of a foraged meal - fingers brushing, a jolt of electric connection surprising you both.

The subtle fragrance of her hair, intensified by the humid rainforest air, filled your senses - a blend of rain-soaked ferns and something uniquely her. The sensation of her leaning into you, seeking warmth against the Abyss's chilly night, was surreal. A lingering touch, a lingering moment, and your pulse quickened as the line between friend and... something more, blurred.

Her bright purple eyes looked up at you, a world of shared secrets glimmering within. The light teasing in her voice softened to a husky whisper, sending delicious shivers down your spine. The feel of her fingers tracing small circles on the back of your hand, absentmindedly, or maybe not, sent a wave of anticipation coursing through you.

<<say $companionLily>>Well, well, aren't we lost in our thoughts? And with such a rosy glow too! Adorable!<</say>>
Lily's voice slices through your reverie like a sunbeam piercing the gloom, her laughter as vibrant as the lush foliage around you. Her bright purple eyes sparkle with amusement, the sight of your blushing face making her grin even wider. Her cotton candy colored hair - reflecting her bold personality - swings in harmony with her jubilant energy.

<<say $mc>>It's... It's nothing, Lily! Just... um... the heat, that's all!<</say>>
You stammer out the lame excuse, your face burning under her unabashed stare. You look anywhere but her, trying to create distance. However, the rainforest floor, a treacherous network of roots and vines, pushes you towards the grinning daredevil.

<<say $companionLily>>The heat, huh? Making you blush like a cherry? I'll remember that for the next time I want a good laugh!<</say>>
She saunters even closer, her probing gaze making you squirm. She maintains her relentless teasing, that infectious grin still playing on her lips. Pausing to adjust the straps of her backpack, she provides you with a moment of sweet relief from her pointed observations.

<<say $mc>>Can we... um... just move... forward?<</say>>
Your gaze darts to the inviting path ahead, the towering trees and vibrant undergrowth beckoning. It's a desperate attempt to divert the attention, a silent prayer embedded in your request.

<<say $companionLily>>Sure thing! But remember, no need to be all bashful about it. We're adventurers, change is our bread and butter! Now, let's see what other wonders the Abyss will reveal to us today!<</say>>
Her laughter echoes around the rainforest as she marches on, her unyielding enthusiasm matching the life teeming around you.

:: Lily Sleep Tight

The morning mismal light glimmers faintly against the frosted landscape of the Abyss's fourth layer. The world is a symphony of pure white; an orchestra of icicles hanging from unseen cliffs, ethereal snowflakes dancing with the wind, and the crunching echoes of icy snow underfoot breaking the tranquil silence. Nestled in the heart of this frigid landscape, you slumber peacefully, oblivious to the world, cocooned in layers of insulated fabric of your tent.

<<say $companionLily>>Oi! Sleeping Beauty! You've got to see this! The sunrise is phenomenal, like straight out of an anime!<</say>>
Lily's voice rings out, an energetic crescendo against the hush of the snowscape. Her rosy cheeks glow vibrantly against the icy blue backdrop, her wide, sparkling eyes shimmering with the thrill of a new day.

A dull sense of consciousness begins to rattle in your head. Stirring from your sleep, the warmth and comfort of your slumber begins to peel away, replaced by the biting cold of the Abyss's fourth layer.

<<say $mc>>Just... five more minutes, Lily...<</say>>
Your words come out in a low mumble, warmth and sleep still lacing your voice.

Her laughter rings out like a crystal bell, high and clear against the low murmur of the chilling wind. She kneels beside your sleeping bag, her hand gently shaking your shoulder.

<<say $companionLily>>Always with the sleep! Alright, you comfy-cozy adventurer, I'll give you five... but then you're getting up to see this, got it?<</say>>
Her words, although teasing, are laced with affection.

You let out a low, sleepy groan, pulling your sleeping bag tighter around you. The sheer comfort of sleep seems to be sinking into your very bones now, making it even more difficult to shake off the allure of the warm cocoon you've nested in.

<<say $mc>>Got it... five more minutes...<</say>>
Your words echo in the hushed cold, your breath forming icy crystals in the frigid air.

With a chuckle, Lily nudges you playfully, her fingers brushing against the rough material of your sleeping bag. The sound of her boisterous laughter echoing in the frosty air makes the icy wilderness a little less daunting, a little more like home. Her boundless energy and unquenchable thirst for thrill serve as an invigorating reminder of the grand adventure you have undertaken together.

<<say $companionLily>>Alright, sleepyhead! But remember, I'm setting a timer! Five minutes, and not a second more!<</say>>
Her voice is filled with infectious glee, her words laced with the excitement of the journey ahead.

:: Lily Massacre Manicure

The merciless heat of the Abyss' fifth layer blazes above you, transforming the vast expanse of sand into a glittering, molten sea. The heat makes mirages dance at the edges of your vision, but the way Lily's eyes spark with fascination is entirely real.

<<say $companionLily>>Hey, look at you, you're like a rock star! Those claws of yours are so edgy!<</say>>
Her gaze is drawn to your hands, to the claws that have replaced your fingernails. The sunlight plays off them, glinting dangerously.

<<say $mc>>A rock star, huh? I was thinking more along the lines of a horror movie monster.<</say>>
You flex your fingers, the claws extending slightly. Their sharp edges glisten ominously. Lily's energetic enthusiasm doesn't falter; instead, she grins, her love for the eccentric and unusual palpable in the scorching air.

<<say $companionLily>>Well, aren't you the life of the party! Embrace the uniqueness! Plus, think about the practical applications. Can opener? You've got it covered. Need to carve your name in a tree? Easy peasy. You're like an overgrown Swiss Army Knife now!<</say>>
Her giggles echo through the barren landscape, a lively melody against the monotonous hum of the distant sandstorms.

<<say $mc>>Yeah, well, it's not all fun and games. Have you ever tried scratching an itch with these things?<</say>>
You brandish your claws, your movements somewhat clumsy as you're still getting used to the new weight and size of your talons. Lily chuckles, a mischievous glint in her eyes.

<<say $companionLily>>Ooh, a challenge! Maybe I could find a way to fashion some cute claw covers for you. Oh, or we could paint them! Do you think nail polish would work on those?<</say>>
She reaches for your hand, her touch feather-light as she traces the edge of one claw with the pad of her thumb, her brows furrowed in deep thought. The sensation sends a shiver up your spine, a curious blend of danger and comfort in her touch. Lily is both thrilled and unfazed by the changes in you, treating this journey through the Abyss with the same excitement she might show for an upcoming anime season premiere. It's part of what makes Lily, well, Lily.

:: Lily Drawing Spades

The spectacle of the sixth layer of the Abyss stretches out around you, a dreamlike fusion of color and form. Tentacles of all sizes ripple around you, their alien forms casting otherworldly shadows against the abyssal obscurity. The soft rustling of their movement forms an eerily calming melody, a stark contrast to the dangerous spikes jutting out from the surfaces of some of the tentacles near you.

<<say $companionLily>>You know, it's not every day you see someone sprout a tail. But with you, I feel like it's Tuesday!<</say>>
Her voice cuts through the low hum of the Abyss, a vibrant note of life amidst the foreign landscape.

You peer back at your new appendage, a sleek tail capped with a heart-like spade. It sways and twines with an autonomy of its own, its gleaming surface reflecting the light around it, every touch of the breeze causing a delightful shudder to roll down your spine.

<<say $mc>>Well, it's not like I had much choice in it. But it's... unique. Unexpected.<</say>>
A joyous, audacious laugh bursts from Lily, resonating within the winding corridors of the Abyss.

<<say $companionLily>>Unexpected, huh? That's one way to put it! But let's be honest, it suits you. You've got this little mischievous demon vibe going on. It's adorable!<</say>>
Her gaze, usually as lively and dynamic as her chitchat, stays on your tail, a hint of fascination flickering within her wide eyes. A tentacle draws near, the thorns scraping against the ebony surface of your tail. You draw back, but Lily is faster, batting the tentacle aside.

<<say $companionLily>>Watch out for those prickly things. Your tail seems sensitive. We wouldn't want anything to hurt it, now would we?<</say>>
A teasing note colors her voice, and her smile broadens as your tail wraps itself fondly around her arm in response.

<<say $mc>>Seems like it's taken a liking to you, Lily.<</say>>
Her laughter echoes once again, light and carefree, merging with the peculiar symphony of the Abyss. The strangeness of the new, of the foreign, fades into the pulsating rhythm of the world around you.

<<say $companionLily>>Well, the feeling's mutual. Now come on, we've got more of this Abyss to explore!<</say>>
With an energetic wave of her hand, Lily blazes the trail, your new tail trailing behind her, as your adventure continues deeper into the heart of the Abyss.

:: Lily Creature of the Night

The lights of the cybernetic cityscape danced on the synthetic cobblestones beneath your feet. Pulsating billboards blinked down on you, all empty, and the robotic chatter was a strange white noise in the background. 

<<say $companionLily>>Oh my gosh, look at you! This is unbelievable!<</say>>
Lily's purple eyes widened to the size of dinner plates, her hair bouncing as she hopped up and down with an energy that seemed insatiable even in the heart of this mechanized metropolis.

<<say $mc>>What? Is there something on my face?<</say>>
You tried to find a reflective surface among the corroded steel and polished chrome, catching the sight of your face in the mirror-like surface of a deactivated android nearby. Your skin held a strange pallor now, an eerie sheen beneath the flashing city lights.

<<say $companionLily>>No, silly, it's just... Well, you're not exactly 'on the sunny side up', are you?<</say>>
She pirouetted around you, her usual grin replaced by a mischievous smirk. She'd always been quick with her wit and tongue, but there was a sparkle in her eyes now, a daring challenge.

<<say $mc>>I'm not really in the mood for your jokes, Lily.<</say>>
You frowned at her, the discomfort of your condition now slightly prickling under the pale synthetic light.

<<say $companionLily>>Hey, don't be such a downer! You always wanted to stand out, right? Well, look at you now - the darkest thing in this bright neon city. Quite the scene-stealer!<</say>>
Her giggles rang in the quiet metropolis, a human sound in the monotone robotic harmony.

<<say $mc>>Yeah, a scene-stealer who needs to avoid sunlight and... needs a bit more than just food to survive.<</say>>
You averted your gaze, staring at the shiny surface of the cobblestones.

<<say $companionLily>>Hey, look at me.<</say>>
She gently lifted your chin with her finger, her eyes meeting yours with a twinkle of courage.

<<say $companionLily>>Yes, things are different, and they might get tougher, but you're not alone. We're in this together, remember?<</say>>
Lily's words echoed in the silent city, the warmth of her hand a comforting contrast against your cold skin. The confidence in her voice, the optimism in her demeanor, brought a smile to your face, a gleam in your unnatural pallor.

<<say $mc>>You're right, Lily. We're in this together. To the end.<</say>>
You squeezed her hand in reply, your cold touch seeming to invigorate rather than deter her. Her talkative, positive personality was infectious, reminding you that even in the Abyss, even as a Creature of the Night, you weren't alone.

:: Khemia Shrunken Assets

Morning light filters through the trees above, casting an strange glow over the odd flora and curious geology of the Abyss's first layer. Every leaf, every rock, every crevice shimmers in the shifting light, creating a landscape that feels both hauntingly beautiful and disturbingly uncanny.

You sit at the base of a towering tree, your back resting against its warm, pulsating bark. The usually comforting thrum of life in the Abyss feels like a distant echo today, drowned out by your own inner turmoil.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Alright, friend, we need to talk.<</say>>
Khemia starts, his normally jovial tone tainted with concern. He's kneeling before you, his broad, scarred hands resting on his sturdy thighs. His keen, brown eyes regard you with a gentleness that you find both comforting and unnerving.

You avoid his gaze, your hands idly picking at the multi-hued grass beneath you. The vibrant blades seem dull and lackluster today, a mirror to your current state.

<<say $mc>>What's there to talk about, Khemia?<</say>>
You deflect his question, your voice barely more than a whisper.

Khemia sighs, the sound echoing through the otherwise silent forest, adding a melancholic soundtrack to the conversation.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Your change... I've noticed it. It's part of the Abyss. Always has been.<</say>>
He shifts, his hand reaching out to catch one of the leaves falling from the canopy, his muscles rippling with controlled power. His every move radiates a strength and confidence that you envy right now.

<<say $mc>>I... I feel less... I don't know... attractive? Powerful?<</say>>
You confess to him, choking on your own insecurity.

Khemia chuckles softly, his gaze softening as he holds the glowing leaf out to you.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Hey, look at this leaf. You'd think it's less 'powerful' than the tree it came from, right?<</say>>
You reach out hesitantly, taking the delicate object from him. It pulses gently in your hand, casting a soft shadow onto your shrunken assets.

<<say $companionKhemia>>But it's not. It carries within it the same strength, the same resilience. It's no less part of the Abyss than the tree it fell from. Same goes for you. Your worth, your power isn't defined by your physical attributes, but by your heart, your courage, and the strength of your spirit.<</say>>
Khemia's warm, confident voice cuts through your self-doubt, instilling a sense of peace and reassurance. His strong, masculine demeanor doesn't waver, even in the face of your transformation, proving his words to be more than mere platitudes. His strength, it seems, is as much a beacon for your courage as his sword is a weapon against the dangers of the Abyss.

:: Khemia Sex Switcheroo MtF

The persistent drizzle of the second layer of the Abyss was a constant background noise, the forest's thick canopy barely keeping the rain at bay. The intense humidity of the region clung to your newly feminine form, your clothing soaked through and sticking to your skin. Tall ferns and undergrowth caressed your softer, curvier legs with every step, a foreign but not entirely unpleasant sensation.

<<say $companionKhemia>>You're moving a bit different, aren't you?<</say>>
Khemia's eyes twinkled with good-natured teasing, his voice resonating deep within the rainforest ambiance. His muscular form towered over you, emanating a warmth that contrasted against the cool forest air.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Almost like you're testing out new shoes. Got some bounce in your... step, haven't you?<</say>>
You blushed, acutely aware of the gentle bob of new curves and breasts that matched his comment. His observation, accurate as it was, brought a heat to your cheeks you hadn't quite expected.

<<say $mc>>I guess I am still getting used to... things. Everything feels so different now.<</say>>
The rich sound of Khemia's laughter echoed through the trees, and he clasped you on the shoulder, his strong grip both reassuring and playful.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Different isn't always a bad thing, you know? It's all a part of being an Abyss adventurer, embracing change and all that jazz.<</say>>
Khemia's grin broadened, his eyes taking on a confident glint.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Sure, your form has changed, but that's just physical. You're still the same tough, determined person inside. And that's what counts.<</say>>
The denseness of the rainforest seemed to pause, the constant hum of insects quieting in the backdrop of his uplifting words. You felt a wave of gratitude towards your companion, your worries easing under his steady reassurance.

<<say $mc>>Thank you, Khemia. Your words mean a lot to me. I guess I'll just have to embrace this change and move forward.<</say>>
Khemia's eyes softened, his usually jovial demeanor giving way to a moment of genuine warmth.

<<say $companionKhemia>>That's the spirit! Remember, the Abyss is a place of transformation. Everyone comes out different than they went in.<</say>>

:: Khemia Sex Switcheroo FtM1

The dense rainforest of the second layer of the Abyss surrounds you, its vibrant greens and exotic wildlife creating an atmosphere both mysterious and alluring. As you walk through the undergrowth, your new male body feels odd, but strangely empowering. The continually dripping dew fills the air with a rejuvenating scent.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, I must say, you look quite different today. You're really pulling off that new masculine look, if I may say so! Did you get taller, too?<</say>>
Khemia flashes a wide grin, showcasing his friendly demeanor and confident attitude.

<<say $mc>>Thanks, Khemia. It's certainly a change, but I'm starting to get used to it. I don't think I've gained any height though.<</say>>
Khemia nods and scratches his chin, thoughtfully observing you.

<<say $companionKhemia>>You know, I've seen my fair share of transformations in the Abyss, but yours has to be one of the most remarkable. You're like a completely different person, but you've still got that same spirit, and I admire that.<</say>>
His eyes sparkle with sincerity and curiosity.

<<say $mc>>It's been a strange experience, but I'm glad to have you by my side, Khemia. Your support means a lot to me.<</say>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Of course! We adventurers need to stick together, no matter the challenges or changes we face. Now, as a fellow man, I think it's time I taught you some swordplay. How about it?<</say>>
Khemia pats his sword hilt and offers you a teasing smirk.

<<say $mc>>I'd love that. Let's get started!<</say>>
As you follow Khemia deeper into the rainforest, his masculine energy and contagious enthusiasm keep your spirits high. The warm light filters through the canopy above, casting dappled light on the two of you as you learn the art of the sword from a true master.

:: Khemia Gooey

The echo of your gooey footfalls resounds in the dimly lit cavern, each step leaving a small, shimmering imprint on the ancient stone floor. You watch as it slowly reabsorbs back into your form - a feature of your recent transformation. An eerie, ambient light is reflecting off your new gooey form, casting an otherworldly glow around the cavern.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, you're certainly not going unnoticed, are you?<</say>>
Khemia chuckles, his masculine voice filling the cavern with a resonant mirth. His rugged features, barely discernible in the dim light, are pulled into a grin as he observes you. Despite his jovial demeanor, you notice a subtle edge of uncertainty in his gaze.

<<say $mc>>Yeah, I guess it's a bit hard to blend in now, isn't it?<</say>>
Your words bubble out of your goo form, carrying a strange resonance. It's a surreal experience, seeing your own words ripple across your new form before vanishing into the ether.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Just a smidge.<</say>>
He steps closer, his heavy boots crunching on the gravel beneath, contrasting your silent, gooey tread. He pauses, a momentary hitch in his confident stride as he looks at you. You notice his Adam's apple bob in a dry swallow - a glimpse of an uncharacteristic discomfort.

<<say $mc>>Does it bother you, Khemia?<</say>>
Your question is more a statement than an inquiry. His normally unwavering gaze is oddly... jittery. Even the stalwart adventurer has his apprehensions, it seems.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Me? Nah, nothing much gets to me, you know that. But, uh... it's definitely different.<</say>>
He gives you a crooked grin, running a hand through his disheveled hair. His confident posture seems to slightly falter for a moment, but he quickly regains it, straightening up and puffing out his chest.

<<say $mc>>But that doesn't mean it's bad, right?<</say>>
As you say this, your gooey hand morphs into an approximation of a thumbs-up, a glistening gesture of reassurance.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Right you are! We'll just have to stick together, won't we?<</say>>
There's a hearty laugh in his words, even as he sidesteps a stray glob of goo on the cavern floor. His eyes meet yours, a glimmer of unspoken camaraderie in them, despite his earlier hesitation.

:: Khemia Reptail

A faint crunch echoes with every footstep you take as you walk through the fourth floor, the new weight and balance from the appendage at your back making your walk a bit more deliberate.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, aren't you a sight? Looks like the Abyss has really given you a souvenir.<</say>>
Khemia's voice rumbles, warm and reassuring against the biting cold. The grin on his face, despite the treacherous conditions, holds no mockery, only open fascination and a spark of excitement.

A sweeping gust of wind cuts your response short, and you pull the edges of your cloak tighter, the new scales on your tail instinctively bristling against the cold. You can't help but feel the Abyss staring at your new form, a keen observer as always.

<<say $mc>>I suppose it has. Not exactly what I expected from our journey, though.<</say>>
Khemia's hearty laughter echoes across the snowy landscape, his breath creating misty plumes in the freezing air. He is a figure of unfazed confidence in this icy expanse, seemingly unaffected by the biting chill. His gloved hand slaps your shoulder companionably.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Expected? No one ever truly knows what to expect from the Abyss. That's part of the thrill, isn't it?<</say>>
His gaze travels from the crest of your reptilian tail to the point where it emerges from the small of your back. Curiosity lights up his eyes, but he doesn't shy away from the unfamiliarity. Instead, his hand reaches out, a silent question hanging between you.

<<say $mc>>Just be careful, it's more sensitive than I expected.<</say>>
With a nod of acknowledgement, his roughened fingers trace the ridges of your tail, the leather of his gloves a stark contrast to the smooth scales. A low whistle escapes his lips, as he takes in the sheer detail of the transformation.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Incredible... The Abyss might be mysterious, but it sure doesn't skimp on the details.<</say>>
Khemia steps back, hands falling to rest on his hips as he surveys your new form. The ghost of his touch lingers on your tail, making you hyper-aware of the chill wind, the snow beneath your boots, the looming Abyss around you.

<<say $companionKhemia>>We'll adapt. That's what we do. Whatever the Abyss throws our way, we handle it. You're no less of an adventurer now, if anything... you're more.<</say>>
His words ring through the snowy landscape, a promise and a challenge rolled into one. You find yourself mirroring his confident smile, your tail swaying behind you.

:: Khemia Pheromones

A bead of sweat trickles down your brow, gliding down your neck, following the trail of a strange new scent. A scentless pheromone, but a call none could ignore. You are the epicenter of a newfound aura, your body exuding an alluring influence that neither you nor anyone else can deny.

<<say $companionLily>>This place is... magical, isn't it?<</say>>
Her voice, low and soft, seemed to blend seamlessly with the faint hum of the Abyss.

<<say $mc>>Well, then it's just like you, Lily.<</say>>
The words hung in the air for a moment, a confession unspoken yet palpable. She glanced at you, surprise widening her eyes before a tender smile curved her lips.

<<say $companionLily>>Your tail... it's...<</say>>
Her words faded, lost in the silent cacophony of the Abyss, yet her eyes remained fixed on your tail, her hand tracing its sleek form.

<<say $mc>>It's what?<</say>>
Your question hung between you, an invitation for her to explore, to dive into the intimacy of the moment.

<<say $companionLily>>It's beautiful. And it feels... incredible. Do you feel this?<</say>>

:: Lily Tail Romance 2

As your lips broke apart, you both were panting, lost in the close-knit universe of the two of you. The moment hung heavy with an electric intimacy, your shared breaths punctuating the silence of the Abyss.

<<say $companionLily>>Your tail... it's reacting to me, isn't it?<</say>>
Her voice was hushed, but the underlying playful tone was unmistakable. She glanced at your tail, still wrapped around her waist, a spark of curiosity in her eyes.

<<say $mc>>It seems so. It's... it's more sensitive than I realized.<</say>>
Her hand gently stroked the length of your tail, each touch sending a new wave of pleasure coursing through your body.

<<say $companionLily>>You trust me, right?<</say>>
The question took you by surprise, but you nodded, unable to form words. Her grin widened as her hand traced the length of your tail, her eyes full of mischief and delight.

Lily released your tail from her waist, her hands gliding over the gleaming surface with an air of reverence. Holding the spade end in her hands, she tilted her head, her gaze moving from it to you, a silent question.

<<say $mc>>Go ahead...<</say>>
Encouraged by your permission, she brought your tail closer to her mouth. Her breath caused a shiver of anticipation to run down its length. She gently parted her lips and began to suck on the tip of your tail.

A groan escaped your lips, the unexpected sensation overwhelming your senses. The feeling was intense, a unique blend of pleasure that sent shockwaves through your entire body. You watched Lily, her eyes closed as she continued to suck on your tail, the look of concentration on her face undeniably alluring.

<<say $companionLily>>I think... it likes that.<</say>>
Her words came out between breaths, a sultry whisper that danced in your ear, sending a different type of thrill through you. Her playful tone, coupled with the unexpected pleasure from her actions, heightened your desire.

Lily kept her eyes on you as she continued her ministrations, the suction of her mouth on your tail creating a potent sensation. Her hands maintained a firm hold on the appendage, her thumb tracing soft patterns against the sensitive skin.

The combination of the visual, the intimacy of the act, and the unique pleasure it gave was intoxicating. It pulled you deeper into a vortex of desire, and you found yourself lost in a maelstrom of sensation. The Abyss and its eerie beauty were forgotten; in that moment, the only thing that mattered was Lily, her lips on your tail, and the electrifying connection between the two of you.

You reached out, intertwining your fingers with hers, grounding yourself in the overwhelming sea of sensations. With a last suck, she let go of your tail, the sudden loss leaving you bereft.

<<say $companionLily>>Your tail... It's different, unique. But it's part of you, and I like it... I like all of you.<</say>>
Her voice was soft, barely audible over the hum of the Abyss. But her words struck you, a confession that echoed within your heart, entwining you deeper with the audacious, adorable girl in front of you.

<<say $mc>>And I like you, Lily.<</say>>
She beamed at you, and it was more radiant than any glow of the miasmal light.

<<say $mc>>Perks? What kind of perks are you talking about?<</say>>
Your voice wavers slightly under his dominant aura. You feel a strange, unfamiliar heat spreading throughout your body.

He speaks with an assertive yet charming grin, an intriguing blend of commanding and inviting. His eyes hold yours, drawing you in with an unspoken promise of mutual pleasure.

Despite the unexpectedness, there's something strangely appealing about the request, something thrilling about the command that triggers a shiver of anticipation. Swallowing hard, you reach over, your hand shaking slightly as it hovers above his lap.

Feeling the heat of his body through his pants, your fingers tremble against the material. His breath hitches as you make contact, the sudden stiffness under your touch makes your heart skip a beat.

After all, every great adventure requires a bit of unexpected thrill.

Your movements continue under Khemia's guidance, his breath growing more ragged, his muscular body taut under the increasing pleasure. You watch him, his handsome face flushed with desire, eyes half-closed, lost in the sensation.

<<say $mc>>Is this... alright?<</say>>
Your voice barely cuts through the heavy silence, almost drowned out by the sound of his deep, ragged breaths.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It's... it's perfect... just... don't stop.<</say>>
His words come out in a strained whisper, each syllable interrupted by sharp intakes of breath.

Then, with a stifled groan, his body stiffens, his grip on your hand tightening. His release is intense, his whole body shaking, a testimony to your actions.

Catching his breath, Khemia leans back against the wall of the Abyss, his intense gaze softening. There's a shared understanding between you, a quiet satisfaction. The experience was new, strange, but incredibly intimate. A bond forged not just in the face of danger, but in shared pleasure too.

<<say $companionKhemia>>That was... remarkable. You continue to surprise me, $app.name.<</say>>
His voice, roughened by his recent climax, holds a note of genuine admiration.

<<say $mc>>I... I'm glad you enjoyed it. I did too.<</say>>
Your voice is shy but there's a newfound confidence in your words.

<<say $companionKhemia>>I thought you might. Remember, this is a two-way street. We're in this Abyss together, aren't we?<</say>>
His grin is back, the playful adventurer replaced by the familiar companion, yet holding the newfound dynamic between you two.

This is only the beginning of your adventure with Khemia. You can't help but wonder, with anticipation and a little bit of fear, what else the Abyss has in store for you both. But one thing is certain, whatever comes, you'll face it together.

:: Cherry Dom Oral Female

You look at Cherry, the gray hue of her eyes reflecting the perpetual exhaustion she wears like a shroud. There's a vulnerability to her that's always been there, but somehow it feels more pronounced now, more accessible. A twist from the Abyss courses through you, filling you with an unusual certainty and dominance.

<<say $mc>>Cherry, come here.<</say>>
She glances at you, her gaze dull but obedient, moving slowly towards you. A small shiver runs down your spine, anticipation tingling across your skin.

<<say $companionCherry>>What do you need?<</say>>
Her voice is quiet, almost a whisper. The usual monotone carries a hint of curiosity.

<<say $mc>>Kneel.<</say>>
A blink, but she doesn't argue, doesn't hesitate. She descends gracefully, her eyes never leaving yours. Your breath hitches, your senses heightened, each small action gaining new weight and meaning.

You can feel the heat coursing through you, a growing, hungry heat. Your body responds instinctively to the subtle shift in dynamics.

<<say $mc>>Undress me.<</say>>
Cherry's hands are cold but steady as they work to remove your clothes. The slow slide of fabric against skin sends a chill up your spine, pooling low in your belly, a delicious contrast to the heat.

Once you're bare before her, you see her eyes flit across your body, taking in your nudity without comment. Your fingers twine in her hair, your grip firm.

<<say $mc>>Make me feel good, Cherry.<</say>>
Her lips press against your inner thigh, her breath cool against the heated skin. A tremor runs through you as her mouth nears your core. Her tongue is a cold shock, her movements slow, deliberate.

You guide her with your hand, the grip in her hair tightening, a silent reminder of your control. Your other hand settles on her shoulder, a contrasting soft touch, an anchor grounding you amidst the onslaught of sensation.

She's attentive, careful, her movements measured and slow. But there's something missing, a spark of life that's absent from her actions. Your dominance compels you to seek it, to demand more of her than simple obedience.

<<say $mc>>Enjoy it, Cherry. I want to see you enjoy it.<</say>>
Your words hang in the air between you, a challenge. For a moment, she's still, her breath ghosting over your slick folds. And then, slowly, her lips part in a small, surprised 'o', her eyes sparkling with the faintest glint of something.

As she continues, there's a difference in her actions. They're still slow, still careful, but there's a hunger there now, a growing desire mirrored in the slow, steady build of pleasure in your core.

Your breaths come in sharp gasps, your grip in her hair tightening as waves of pleasure start to roll over you. The world narrows down to the sensation of her mouth on you, her hands gripping your thighs, the heat building within you.

As you crest over the edge of your pleasure, Cherry remains there, her lips soft and comforting. Your hands release their grip on her, instead carding through her hair gently, a soothing counterpoint to your earlier dominance.

<<say $mc>>Good girl, Cherry.<</say>>
Your voice is low, warm, the newfound dominance making room for something softer, something that glows with the satisfaction of having elicited something beyond mere compliance from the normally impassive Cherry.

:: Cherry Dom Oral Male

But today, as the effects of the Abyss ripple through you, you can't help but feel a spark of desire towards her, a desire to command, to dominate.

<<say $companionCherry>>Everything's just... kind of grey, you know?<</say>>
Cherry's voice is quiet and flat, not an unusual tone for her. She has a distinct slouch to her posture and a weary look in her eyes. Her fingers idly twirl a lock of hair.

You take in her words, the new-found dominance pulsating within you. You're not sure exactly how the Abyss did this, but your confidence has surged, and so have your desires.

<<say $mc>>Cherry.<</say>>
Your voice resonates in the eerie silence of the Abyss.

<<say $mc>>Look at me.<</say>>
She raises her gaze to meet yours, surprise flickering in her usually vacant eyes.

A hint of curiosity seeping into her otherwise monotone voice.

You stare at her, feeling a heat surge through your body as your dominant side takes hold.

<<say $mc>>I need you, Cherry.<</say>>
You take a step closer to her.

<<say $mc>>Right now.<</say>>
She blinks, looking stunned for a moment, before a faint blush paints her cheeks. The tone of your voice is commanding, and it stirs something in her, a little spark that's been buried under her depression.

<<say $companionCherry>>You... you do?<</say>>
Her voice is a soft murmur, but her eyes remain locked with yours.

Your answer is a silent nod, a determined look in your eyes. The anticipation begins to build within you, your body reacting to the tantalizing prospect of her touch.

<<say $mc>>I want your mouth, Cherry.<</say>>
You unzip your trousers and orient them towards her face.

You watch as she hesitates for a moment, then slowly sinks to her knees in front of you. Her hand is shaky as it reaches out to touch you, but there's a newfound determination in her eyes.

The sensation of her warm hand grasping your penis sends a thrill through your body. She looks up at you, her big eyes seeming a little less empty now. She sticks out her tongue tentatively, as if gauging your reaction.

Feeling her warm, soft tongue begin to glide along the length of your shaft makes your breath hitch. Her tongue is surprisingly skilled, drawing small circles around the sensitive tip of your penis, which makes your heart pound. You reach down to grip her hair, not rough, but firm.

<<say $mc>>That's it, Cherry. Just like that.<</say>>
You murmur, enjoying the sight of her. Her depression is still there, etched into the furrows of her brow, but for a moment, she seems to forget about it, too engrossed in pleasing you. Her mouth opens, taking in more of you, and you feel a flush spread through your body as she starts to suck. It's a strange contrast, her gloomy demeanor and this intimate act, but it stirs your desire even more.

<<say $companionCherry>>Mmm...<</say>>
Her voice is muffled, her mouth filled with your penis. She looks up at you with half-lidded eyes, a hint of eagerness slipping through her usual apathy.

Your heart pounds in your chest as you direct her movements, your fingers tangled in her hair. The warmth of her mouth, the wet slide of her tongue, and the slightly uncomfortable pressure of her teeth send a wave of pleasure coursing through your veins.

<<say $mc>>Cherry... I'm getting close.<</say>>
You warn her, your grip in her hair tightening. The pulsating pleasure is building up, and you feel like you're on the brink.

She doesn't stop, her eyes still locked with yours, her movements only becoming more fervent. The sight of her, kneeling before you, the spark in her eyes, and the feeling of her mouth push you over the edge.

As you come, your knees go weak, and a low moan escapes your lips. The grip you have on her hair loosens, and you watch her swallow before she pulls away, her cheeks a little flushed.

<<say $companionCherry>>Did... did I do okay?<</say>>
She asks you with her voice barely above a whisper.

You can't help but smile, leaning down to cup her face and give her a reassuring nod. The changes from the Abyss might have been strange, but moments like this... they're worth it.

<<say $mc>>You did great, Cherry. Really great.<</say>>
Her lips quirk up in a small smile, and you can't help but think that this is one of the few times you've seen her genuinely happy.

:: Khemia Aegis 1

The soft glow of the campfire flickers, casting dancing shadows on Khemia's ruggedly handsome face. His amber eyes gleam with a mix of determination and excitement as he stares at the mysterious artifact laying beside you.

<<say $companionKhemia>>That Relic you've got there, the Aegis Coffin... it's something else, isn't it?<</say>>
He reaches over, tracing his fingertips over the enigmatic carvings on the coffin's lid, his face reflecting a spark of awe.

<<say $mc>>Yes, it is. Quite useful on this treacherous journey. <</say>>
Khemia nods, his gaze still firmly on the coffin.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It would make a man invincible, don't you think? I mean, imagine wielding a sword with an orichalcum skeleton. You'd be indestructible.<</say>>
He grins, the idea clearly intriguing him.

<<say $mc>>Well, invincible is a stretch. But it would definitely make you stronger, more resistant to injury. Why do you ask?<</say>>
Khemia hesitates for a moment, as if wrestling with his thoughts, before he finally looks up at you with a sincere expression.

<<say $companionKhemia>>I've been thinking... I want to reach the bottom of the Abyss, and I'm sure you do too. If I could use the Aegis Coffin, I could become stronger. I could protect you, protect us better. Would you let me?<</say>>
His voice holds a rare tone of vulnerability. Khemia, the fearless adventurer, is asking for the player's help. This is a journey where they both need to rely on each other, after all.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Thank you, truly. I'll use this chance wisely, I promise.<</say>>
As Khemia steps into the Aegis Coffin, you can't help but feel a sense of unease. But you have trust in your friend and hope for a successful transformation.

The next morning, Khemia emerges from the Aegis Coffin. His body feels different, stronger. His old skeleton, made of mere bone, lies neatly beside him, a memorial of what he once was.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, this is certainly a strange souvenir...<</say>>
He holds his old skeleton with a fascinated expression, marveling at the thought that these fragile bones once held him together. With his newly transformed orichalcum skeleton, Khemia is ready to face the deeper abyss, stronger and more determined than ever.

:: Khemia Aegis No

You pause, searching Khemia's face. His eyes are earnest, pleading even. But you have to consider the consequences, the risks, and the unknowns that lie within the Abyss.

<<say $mc>>Khemia, I understand why you want to use it, but I can't let you. We don't know enough about the potential side effects of the Aegis Coffin, and I won't risk your life on a gamble.<</say>>
Khemia's expression falters, disappointment flashing briefly across his face. But he quickly recomposes himself, a small, faltering smile struggling across his lips.

<<say $companionKhemia>>I see... You're right. We shouldn't take unnecessary risks. I appreciate your concern, though. Let's keep moving forward.<</say>>
You nod, relieved that Khemia accepts your decision, but he doesn't seem happy about it. This journey through the Abyss is dangerous enough, there's no need for unnecessary risks.

:: Saeko Layer4 Convo

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/SaekoL4.png']]

The desolate landscape of the fourth layer is a pristine wilderness, a blanket of snow unmarred by footprints, stretching into the fog-laden horizon. Occasional glacial mountains peak above the sheet of white, appearing as lonely sentinels in the deserted expanse. Sparse, stunted vegetation clings tenaciously to life, hardy survivors in a frozen desert.

<<say $companionSaeko>>It's fascinating yet terrifying, isn't it? This layer... it's a cryogenic wonder, one that's eerily beautiful in its own harsh, barren way. But we need to be careful. The Miasma-produced winds can dislodge ice from the ceiling, causing avalanches of snow and hail.<</say>>
Saeko's breath frosts in the air as she speaks, her tone analytical but laced with a touch of apprehension. She stares out at the bleak landscape, her gloved hand absently brushing over a struggling plant, its leaves brittle in the icy chill. Her dark eyes, usually filled with academic curiosity, are now shadowed with concern.

<<say $mc>>It's not just the snow and hail we need to worry about. This cold... it's almost unnatural. It penetrates everything.<</say>>
Your voice emerges in a cloud of vapor, the harsh cold stinging your lungs with every breath. Despite the insulation of your gear, the cold bites at your extremities, an incessant gnawing that refuses to relent.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Yes, I've read about this. The Miasma has some peculiar properties here. It seems to exacerbate the cold, making it far more penetrating than it naturally would be. The Miasma, it's... it's a force, an entity of its own. It's strange how its properties change in different locations.<</say>>
Saeko's words echo in the icy silence, amplifying the sense of isolation in the barren landscape. She huddles closer, her breath hitching as she pulls her coat tighter around herself. The bitter cold seems to accentuate her vulnerability, chipping away at the composed facade she usually holds.

<<say $mc>>We're in this together, Saeko. We'll figure it out.<</say>>
Your words, meant to be comforting, hang in the chilled air. In this harsh environment, they seem to strengthen the bond you share, born out of mutual respect and growing affection. Saeko looks at you, her gaze softening.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I know... and I appreciate it. I've spent years studying the Abyss, but being here... experiencing it firsthand is... different. It's more raw, more real.<</say>>
There is a tremor in her voice, her academic demeanor flickering as she is confronted with the harsh realities of the Abyss. The biting cold, the hostile environment, the unsettling transformations... all feel far more immediate and terrifying than words on a page.

<<say $mc>>That's what makes it an adventure, Saeko. And having you here... that makes it worth it.<</say>>
The words tumble out, a candid confession in the harsh, cold wilderness of the Abyss. The bitter cold suddenly seems a little less biting, the bleak landscape a little less desolate. The shared hardship has brought you closer, sparking a flame of warmth in the icy heart of the Abyss.


:: Saeko Inhuman Affection

The bizarre quietness of the Abyss is punctuated by the sounds of Saeko meticulously noting down observations in her journal, a diligent ritual that has become a comforting background score to your expedition.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I've always been captivated by the lifeforms here, you know?<</say>>
Her voice carries a tinge of reverence. Her eyes never leave the vibrant, bioluminescent flower she's studying - a bulbous plant that gently pulsates with light, reacting to her touch.

You nod, a smile playing on your lips. The massive changes you've undergone in the Abyss are undeniably challenging. The body that once felt like your own now seems more like a ship weathering a constant storm of transformation, the details of which are indescribable. Yet, here you are, standing firm, and in these moments of tranquility, you have begun to appreciate the majesty of this place, much like Saeko does.

<<say $mc>>What made you choose to specialize in Abyssal plants?<</say>>
You finally ask the question that's been lingering in your mind.

Saeko's usually stern face relaxes, and she takes off her glasses, wiping away the light dust accumulated on them. The bioluminescent glow reflects in her eyes, giving them a mysterious depth.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Ah, that's quite a tale. Growing up, my home was near a botanical garden. Every day after school, instead of heading home like other children, I would go there. Fascinated by every leaf, petal, and twig, I'd lose track of time. You could say those plants were my first friends.<</say>>
She pauses, lost in memories.

You watch Saeko with interest, her story adding layers to her personality.

<<say $companionSaeko>>But the moment I learned about the Abyss and its flora, so vastly different from anything I had ever seen, I knew that's where my real journey began. The plants here, their beauty, their resilience...they tell a story of adaptation and survival that we can barely comprehend. I wanted to... no, I needed to understand their secrets.<</say>>
Her voice brims with a passion that transcends the academic, speaking volumes about her love for the Abyss and its unique life forms. It's a side of her you hadn't fully seen before.

<<say $mc>>Your dedication is inspiring, Saeko.<</say>>
A fleeting smile graces her lips, a subtle blush spreading across her cheeks. But she quickly regains her composure.

<<say $companionSaeko>>And you... you're a walking testament to the Abyss's power of transformation, aren't you? I must admit, it's both intriguing and unsettling.<</say>>
Her gaze rests on you, her scholarly curiosity piqued.

This is the first time Saeko has addressed the changes you've been undergoing. You smile, appreciating her frankness and genuine interest.

<<say $mc>>That's one way to put it, yes. I've learned a lot about myself in the process, too.<</say>>
She nods, her gaze returning to the pulsating plant before her, a symbol of the Abyss's unfathomable mysteries, which you both continue to navigate in your own ways.


:: Saeko Inhuman Romance

The miasma-filled air of the Abyss clings to your skin, a thick, tangible reminder of your surroundings. Saeko stands rigid, her fingers wringing nervously, her gaze fixated on your drastically altered form. It's as if an unseen artist has decided to reshape you over the course of your journey, giving birth to a new form, so different yet eerily familiar.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Your transformation is... it's absolutely remarkable, scientifically speaking. I've never witnessed anything like this firsthand.<</say>>
She tries to keep her tone steady, her words analytical. Yet, her voice betrays a hint of anxiety, a tremor that belies her composed scientist exterior. She takes a step back, pushing a loose strand of hair behind her ear in an anxious gesture.

<<say $mc>>I... well, yeah. It feels as remarkable as you say, Saeko. But how do I look?<</say>>
Your voice is calm, though the undercurrent of uncertainty is palpable. Your eyes seek Saeko's in a silent plea for reassurance. The shadows dance across your face, enhancing the eerie beauty of your transformed form.

<<say $companionSaeko>>You... look... different. But not in a negative sense. It's just... unexpected, astonishing really.<</say>>
She stumbles over her words, struggling to maintain her typically methodical articulation. Her gaze softens as she observes you, your altered presence a testament to the Abyss' mystifying power. A pause hangs heavily between you, as if the Abyss itself holds its breath, the low hum of the unseen creatures your only accompaniment.

<<say $mc>>Saeko, you're rambling. Are you alright?<</say>>
The question is gentle, laced with concern. You reach out, your newly formed hand stopping mid-air, uncertain.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I apologize... I'm just... This is a lot to process. I mean, we knew the Abyss could change you, but seeing it, experiencing it... it's another matter entirely.<</say>>
Her voice trails off, and she glances away, her boots scuffing against the rough, alien terrain. Suddenly, she seems smaller, the formidable researcher dwarfed by the weight of your predicament.

<<say $mc>>It is. But we knew what we were getting into, didn't we? We're in this together, Saeko.<</say>>
Your voice is warm, a soothing balm against the chilling reality. You extend your hand fully now, reaching for Saeko's. The glow from the miasma casts a spectral light on your intertwined fingers.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Yes, we are. And I... I care about you, more than I thought I would. More than just a fellow researcher or... or a companion.<</say>>
Her confession hangs in the air, echoing in the silence of the Abyss. She takes a deep breath, her eyes locking with yours.

<<say $mc>>Saeko, I-<</say>>
Before you can finish, Saeko leans in, pressing her lips against yours in a soft, tentative kiss. It's a silent affirmation of your unspoken feelings, a beacon of warmth amidst the cold, otherworldly mystery of the Abyss.

You pull away slowly, the echo of the kiss still lingering between you. Saeko's eyes are wide, her breath hitching slightly as she gazes at you.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I... I hope that was alright. I've been wanting to... Well, it's not very scientific of me, is it?<</say>>
There's a vulnerability in her voice, a departure from her usual academic tone. She's trying to mask her fear with humor, her grip on your hand tightening.

<<say $mc>>Maybe not, but it's human, Saeko. We're not just researchers here. We're people too... and I've been wanting to do that as well.<</say>>
A smile spreads across your face, your eyes softening as you look at Saeko. Your grip tightens around her hand, a silent affirmation of your shared feelings.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Then we're on the same page. Even amidst all this... change, it's good to know some things remain constant.<</say>>
She returns the smile, a genuine one this time. Your joined hands seem to glow in the eerie luminescence, a symbol of your connection amidst the ever-shifting Abyss.


:: Saeko Hand Male

Saeko seems to be eyeing you in a different way than usual, with an intense warmth in her gaze that's slowly appeared as you've gotten to know her better.

<<say $companionSaeko>>We've made such a fascinating discoveries down here, haven't we?<</say>>
Her tone is analytical, yet her gaze, which flickers with a spark of heat, indicates a softness that contrasts with her scientific demeanor. Her hand, normally manipulating petri dishes or recording data, now reaches for yours, tracing gentle circles on your palm. You feel an unexpected and potent heat radiating from her touch.

<<say $mc>>Yes, we have, Saeko. But there's more to this place than just data and specimens, isn't there?<</say>>
You watch as her eyes flicker with a quiet understanding. Her fingers tentatively trace their way up your arm, across your shoulder, causing you to shudder as they brush lightly against your skin. Your breath hitches in your throat as her touch descends to your waistband, her touch surprisingly confident.

<<say $companionSaeko>>There is... There's a vitality, a life force in the Abyss that transcends typical biological explanation. Perhaps... we're part of it?<</say>>
Her words are imbued with an uncharacteristic vulnerability. Her hand moves downward, her fingers exploring, tracing your arousal through the fabric of your trousers. Your heart pounds against your chest as you draw in a sharp breath, your body reacting to her boldness.

<<say $mc>>I... I think you're right, Saeko.<</say>>
You feel her fingers deftly undo the button, her breath hitching as she unzips your trousers and you spring free. You feel the cool air of the Abyss against your heated skin. It's a tantalizing sensation that leaves you gasping, your arousal throbbing under her gentle touch.

<<say $companionSaeko>>You're quite... lively. Like the Abyss, vibrant and full of energy.<</say>>
You can't help the small laugh that bubbles up from your throat at her choice of words, her academic nature never quite leaving her. The sensation of her hand encircling you causes your breath to hitch. Her touch is as cautious and curious as the way she approaches her scientific work, exploring you with a slow and attentive pace that has your heart pounding in your chest.

<<say $mc>>Saeko... you're making me feel... incredible.<</say>>
Her thumb sweeps over the tip, your hips bucking involuntarily at the unexpected stimulation. You gasp, your fingers gripping her shoulder. She gazes at you with curiosity, as if cataloguing every reaction.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Your responses are... quite illuminating.<</say>>
Her hand works you with a steady rhythm, her touch firm yet tender. You're overwhelmed by the intense sensations coursing through you, heat spreading through your body like wildfire. Her intellectual approach to your intimate encounter only serves to heighten your arousal, the merging of two worlds – her scientific curiosity and your raw desires – culminating in an electrifying experience that has you teetering on the edge.

<<say $mc>>Saeko... I'm... close.<</say>>
She nods, her touch not faltering as you shudder beneath her. The intense sensations build, your climax approaching with a swiftness that has you gasping. The anticipation is a sweet torture that Saeko seems determined to prolong.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Experience it... just like we do with the mysteries of the Abyss.<</say>>
Her words, so full of academic allure and sensual promise, push you over the edge. You let out a choked gasp as the pleasure crashes over you, your climax an explosion of sensation. Your vision blurs, your breath hitching as you ride out the waves of pleasure.

<<say $mc>>Saeko... that was... amazing.<</say>>
In the afterglow, she gazes at you, her eyes filled with a quiet satisfaction. The adventure through the Abyss had brought forth an unexpected intimacy, a deep connection that was as mysterious and awe-inspiring as the environment around you.

:: Khemia Layer6 Convo

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/KhemiaL6.png']]

The villi beneath your feet wriggle and squirm, gently stroking and prodding at your ankles and calves, filling you with an unexpected, alien sense of discomfort.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Never thought you'd see the day when you'd walk on living carpet, huh?<</say>>
Khemia speaks with a slight smirk, his expression revealing both amusement and fascination.

<<say $companionKhemia>>There's always something new waiting for us in the Abyss. Each layer more strange than the last. That's why I can't help but push further. It's a lure I can't resist.<</say>>
The journey continues. As you venture deeper into this bizarre layer, the tentacles grow in size, swarming around your waists and eliciting a mixture of discomfort and intrigue. The ambient temperature climbs steadily, the air becoming hot and heavy, akin to an intense sauna, making every breath a laborious task. Flames dance amidst the fields of tentacles, a strange sight that transforms the environment into an uncanny, fiery hellscape. Oddly, despite the blaze, the heat seems to only lightly tickle your skin, as though you are wrapped in a warm, gentle breeze rather than being in the midst of a wildfire.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Abyss, you continue to outdo yourself.<</say>>
Khemia exclaims, his eyes gleaming with wild excitement. His hand runs over the tip of his sword, fingers tracing the cold metal.

<<say $companionKhemia>>A field of fire, a sea of tentacles, and a burning desire to go even deeper. I won't let these stop me. I want to know what's waiting for us at the bottom. No, I need to know.<</say>>
Throughout the layer, you spot small pieces of ancient rubble, the remnants of a past civilization or a forgotten era. Yet the tentacles and flames have ravaged them beyond recognition, reducing them to meaningless chunks of stone amidst the living and burning landscape.

<<say $mc>>Khemia, you do realize the risks, right? This is uncharted territory. We're already facing challenges that no one has ever encountered before. Is the unknown really worth risking everything?<</say>>
Khemia turns towards you, his gaze filled with a mix of excitement, determination, and a hint of madness. His flirty nature seems to dissipate for a moment, replaced by an almost palpable gravity.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Yes. It's worth it. Because for adventurers like us, it's not the destination, but the journey that defines us. And I'll do anything, risk everything, to continue this journey to the very end. Even if it's the bottom of the Abyss.<</say>>
There is a silence, a deep pause, filled only with the squelching of the tentacle carpet underfoot and the crackling of the exotic fires nearby. Khemia's words hang in the air, as palpable as the heat. His conviction seems to charge the atmosphere, the tension between you almost tangible.

<<say $mc>>And if it costs you your life? You're ready to pay that price?<</say>>
Khemia's steps falter for a moment, then he steels himself and continues plowing through the navel-high tentacles. He stares into the dancing flames, his eyes reflecting an array of vivid hues from the fire. The backdrop of smoky air and flickering light lends an ethereal quality to his strong features.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Life is a fleeting moment, a glimmer in the endless expanse of time. If I can spend that moment pushing boundaries, exploring unknown territories, and treading where no one else dares, then it would be a life well lived, don't you think?<</say>>
Khemia's reply is met with another silence. As you trek through this bizarre landscape, you can sense the intensity of the Abyss layer growing. The fiery tentacles seem to sway in tandem with your conversation, their intensity reflecting the ardor of your dialogue.

<<say $mc>>That's... one way to look at it. But isn't there anything else you want? Outside of the Abyss?<</say>>
Khemia turns his gaze back from the flames and looks at you. The smirk returns to his face, the charismatic charm sneaking back into his eyes.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Oh, there are plenty of things I want, but right now, I can't think of a better place to be, or a better person to be with. The Abyss and its mysteries... they're part of me. And you... You're part of this journey.<</say>>
Khemia gives you a sly wink, but his return to his typical charming attitude does little to lighten the gravity of the conversation. But it is a reminder of who Khemia is - a man driven to explore, living on the edge of the unknown, determined to reach the ends of the Abyss, no matter what.


:: Lily Creator Ask

Lily's eyes shimmered with childlike curiosity as she gazed at the glowing Relic in your possession.

<<say $companionLily>>You know, I've been thinking... about that crazy relic of yours, the Creator's Bolt. Mind if I give it a whirl?<</say>>
Her tone was playful and filled with a barely restrained excitement, a testament to her thrill-seeking nature.

<<say $mc>>What exactly did you have in mind, Lily?<</say>>
She twirled a strand of her hair, her eyes lit up like the midnight stars as her imagination took over.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh, you know me! I've got a few ideas. I mean, imagine... creating your own anime, your own travel documentary... or even your own video game! It's mind-blowing!<</say>>
The wild energy radiating from her was infectious, igniting your own curiosity.

<<say $mc>>What kind of anime would you create?<</say>>
Her lips stretched into a wide grin as she delved into a vivid explanation.

<<say $companionLily>>Well, let's see. It would be an epic adventure through various dimensions. Our protagonist would be a fearless traveller, a bit like us! But with a twist, they would have the power to morph into different creatures from each dimension they visit. Each episode would be a new world to explore, a new creature to master. It'll be action-packed, filled with vibrant colors and grand battles!<</say>>
Your mind spun with the visuals she painted, the concept was compelling indeed.

<<say $mc>>Sounds thrilling. And the travel documentary?<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>Ah, the documentary. Imagine this: A journey through the Abyss! Showcasing the changes we experience and the strange landscapes we encounter. Of course, it'll be peppered with our own commentary and banter. And every episode would end with a heart-warming campfire scene.<</say>>
You could almost see the flickering campfire and feel the warmth radiating from her words.

<<say $mc>>And the video game?<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>A role-playing game set in the Abyss! Each player can customize their own avatar and experience the changes just like we do. Players can create their own narrative within the game as they explore. It'll have stunning graphics, engaging combat systems, and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack!<</say>>
Her excitement was palpable as she eagerly awaited your response.


:: Lily Creator Yes

Lily's eyes glowed with a hopeful spark as she outlined her imaginative media dreams. She finished with an almost tangible wave of exhilaration.

<<say $mc>>Sounds like you've put a lot of thought into this. Well, Lily... go ahead. Let's see what you can create with the Creator's Bolt.<</say>>
There was a moment of stunned silence as your words sunk in. Then, with a burst of infectious energy, she jumped up, punching the air in victory.

<<say $companionLily>>Yes! This is going to be fantastic! We're about to change the Abyss and the world beyond, one piece of media at a time!<</say>>
Her laughter filled the air, her joy at the prospect of using the Relic brightening even the darkest corners of the Abyss. You couldn't help but share in her excitement, the potential of the Creator's Bolt suddenly seeming more appealing than ever.


:: Lily Creator No

Her excitement was palpable as she eagerly awaited your response.

<<say $mc>>Lily, as interesting as your ideas are, I think we need to keep the Creator's Bolt for more crucial situations. We're in the Abyss, after all.<</say>>
Her jubilant energy deflated like a punctured balloon, her eyes reflecting a rare flicker of disappointment and irritation.

<<say $companionLily>>You've got to be kidding me! So you're saying that we have this amazing piece of magic that can make all sorts of wonderful media... and we're just going to hoard it for 'crucial situations'? This is exactly why people don't enjoy their time in the Abyss!<</say>>
She threw her arms up in exasperation before crossing them in front of her chest.

<<say $mc>>I understand where you're coming from, Lily. But we don't fully understand the rules and risks of this place yet. It's better to be safe than sorry.<</say>>
Despite your words of reassurance, Lily huffed in irritation, turning away from you with a muttered grumble under her breath. The tension hung heavy in the Abyss around you.


:: Maru Smitten Ask

Maru's eyes sparkle with excitement, his usually round cheeks puffed up slightly, resembling a chipmunk. His fingers toy with the edge of his frilly dress as he anxiously paces back and forth in the dimly lit campsite, something obviously bothering him.

<<say $companionMaru>>Um... I have a request to ask... it's about a Relic we found<</say>>
He hesitates, looking down, twiddling with the hem of his dress with his nimble fingers.

His tone is apprehensive, his usual cheerful demeanor slightly replaced with uncertainty.

<<say $mc>>What's up, Maru? What's this about a Relic?<</say>>
You tilt your head, genuinely curious. He has been an irreplaceable companion on your journey, always providing a soothing presence despite the harsh and unpredictable nature of the Abyss.

Maru reaches into his bag, pulling out a white glove, almost like a single mitt. It's simple, yet somehow it holds a certain charm, drawing you in with an uncanny sense of warmth. This is the Smitten Mitt. The boy bites his lower lip, his eyes avoiding direct contact with yours, his actions hinting at a touch of embarrassment.

<<say $companionMaru>>Can I... can I use the Smitten Mitt? I think it can help me... you know, with the stress of the journey.<</say>>
He mumbles, holding the Mitt close to his chest as he speaks.


:: Maru Smitten Yes

Despite his timidness, you're touched by Maru's vulnerability. He's thinking about his own wellbeing, which is important on this challenging journey.

<<say $mc>>Absolutely, Maru. If the Smitten Mitt can provide some comfort, I think you should definitely use it.<</say>>
Upon hearing your words, Maru's eyes light up like two twinkling stars. A radiant smile crosses his face, and he clutches the Mitt tighter to his chest, his anxiety replaced with a noticeable feeling of relief and joy.

<<say $companionMaru>>Thank you...thank you so much! This means a lot to me!<</say>>
Upon your approval, Maru nods eagerly, his face radiant with anticipation. He carefully slips his hand into the Smitten Mitt, a small sigh of contentment escaping his lips as he does so.

<<say $companionMaru>>It... it feels so real.<</say>>
He whispers in awe, his fingers gently curling around the phantom grip of the Mitt.

His usually vibrant eyes soften, a faraway look taking over as he closes them. The usual hyperactive Maru seems to melt away, replaced by a serene figure, his lips slightly parted in a small, peaceful smile.

<<say $companionMaru>>It's... it's like holding onto someone's hand... someone who's there for you.<</say>>
Maru's voice is soft, but his words echo around the campsite, bouncing off the silent abyssal walls surrounding you.

Observing him, you realize the depth of the Smitten Mitt's effect. It's not just about the physical sensation, but also about the emotional assurance it provides. A sense of companionship, of not being alone, seems to radiate from Maru, warming the otherwise cold campsite.

Maru then opens his eyes, the blissful peace on his face replaced by his usual joviality. But there's a new-found confidence in his gaze, a sense of calm that wasn't there before. It's evident that the Smitten Mitt has done its magic, calming his nerves and alleviating the stress of the journey.

<<say $companionMaru>>I feel so much better! This is going to help a lot!<</say>>
He exclaims, waving his Mitt-clad hand around with a cheery giggle.

His lightheartedness brings a smile to your face. The Smitten Mitt had been a good call, and seeing Maru like this assures you that your journey through the Abyss will be a bit more bearable with the power of this Relic and the power of your bond.


:: Maru Smitten No

Despite his timidness, you consider his request. But you can't help but feel a tad worried. You've only got one Smitten Mitt, and it might be needed for an emergency situation.

<<say $mc>>I'm sorry, Maru, but we need to keep the Smitten Mitt in reserve. We don't know what we'll face further down in the Abyss.<</say>>
Maru's face drops, the excited spark in his eyes fading. His shoulders slump, and he clutches the Mitt tighter, almost protectively, a look of disappointment clearly etched on his features.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh... okay, I understand.<</say>>
He mutters quietly, his usual lively tone missing, replaced by a hint of sadness.


:: Lily Merrymaker Ask

A mischievous grin spreads across Lily's face, her eyes gleaming with enthusiasm as she twirls a lock of lavender hair around her finger. There's a particular sparkle to her expression, the one that usually precedes her craziest ideas. She pats the Heavenly Merrymaker in her hand, the unusual triangle cap gleaming under the muted light.

<<say $companionLily>>Hey, so I've been thinking... I mean, we've got this awesome Relic here. The Heavenly Merrymaker. Pretty rad, right?<</say>>
She spins the cap around her fingers with an expert flick, her gaze never leaving yours. It's clear she's building up to something, an anticipation filling the air between you.

<<say $mc>>It's an intriguing artifact, no doubt. But remember, we're in the Abyss for a purpose. It's not just about having fun.<</say>>
Lily rolls her eyes at you, her exuberant personality unaffected by your pragmatic words. She places the Heavenly Merrymaker on her head, the cap perched at a jaunty angle. A moment later, she removes it and sighs, a playful pout on her lips.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh, come on, don't be such a spoilsport! Just imagine the possibilities! We could have a blast with this thing. Anime marathons, exploring weird places, and I mean, come on... endless fun with zero consequences? It's like a dream come true!<</say>>
Lily's fervor is contagious, her enthusiasm radiating off her in palpable waves. Yet, there's also a sincerity in her eyes, a genuine yearning for the thrill and joy she's suggesting.

<<say $mc>>And how would that help us with our expedition? We need to stay focused, Lily.<</say>>
Her confident grin doesn't waver. Instead, she leans closer, her gaze determined.

<<say $companionLily>>Look, I get it. We're here for serious business, and I'm not suggesting we goof off all the time. But remember, the Abyss changes people, right? So what if this 'endless fun' could be a strategy? Maybe it'll keep us sane amidst all this craziness! Besides, wouldn't you want to have a moment of joy in a place like this?<</say>>
You find yourself considering Lily's words. The Abyss is indeed a strange and unsettling place, and perhaps this light-hearted approach could provide a semblance of normalcy. The mirthful gleam in Lily's eyes and her infectious enthusiasm make the idea all the more tempting.


:: Lily Merrymaker Yes

A moment of silence stretches between the two of you as you weigh Lily's proposal. She watches you, her eager anticipation hanging in the balance of your decision. After a moment, you sigh, a reluctant smile tugging at the corners of your mouth.

<<say $mc>>Alright, Lily. We'll give it a try. But remember, we can't lose sight of our mission.<</say>>
A victorious whoop echoes from Lily, her eyes sparkling brighter than ever before. She holds the Heavenly Merrymaker up, a trophy of her successful persuasion.

<<say $companionLily>>You won't regret this, promise! Now, let's see... where's that list of animes I wanted to marathon?<</say>>
Her excitement fills the atmosphere, bringing a rare moment of lightness and levity amidst the ever-changing, unfamiliar landscape of the Abyss. As she delves into planning your first 'timeless' escapade, you can't help but share in her anticipation. Perhaps this unconventional strategy might just work, or at least, provide some much-needed laughter along the way.


:: Lily Merrymaker No

Lily's enthusiasm hangs in the air, the silence stretching as you consider her proposition. Eventually, you sigh, shaking your head and looking at the Heavenly Merrymaker thoughtfully.

<<say $mc>>I understand what you're saying, Lily, but we have to stay focused. We can't afford to lose sight of our mission here.<</say>>
The vibrant energy surrounding Lily seems to deflate, her exuberance fading away into visible disappointment. She takes a step back, reluctantly setting the cap back into your hand.

<<say $companionLily>>I... I see. You're right. I was just... well, I guess I got carried away by the idea. I just thought it could... you know, make things a bit lighter. But you're right. We're here for a reason.<</say>>
Her voice trails off, her gaze averted from yours. It's rare to see her this subdued, her lively spirit dampened by your decision.

<<say $mc>>I know it's not what you wanted to hear, Lily. But we have to stay vigilant. The Abyss is unpredictable. We need to be prepared for anything.<</say>>
She nods at your words, her lips curling into a small, resigned smile. Despite her disappointment, she seems to respect your decision.

<<say $companionLily>>Yeah, you're right. We've got a job to do, after all. No point getting distracted by... well, distractions.<</say>>
She takes a deep breath, a spark of her usual optimism returning to her eyes. Even in disappointment, Lily's resilient spirit manages to shine through.

:: Maru Pangea Ask

The expedition's latest find, the Pangea Shaker, sits on the makeshift table between you and Maru, its shell catching the light and casting a prismatic glow in the dimly lit Abyss.

<<say $companionMaru>>Hey, um, do you think... maybe... I could use that? The Pangea Shaker, I mean...<</say>>
Maru blushes, nervously fiddling with the frills of his apron, eyes locked on the Relic.

<<say $mc>>The Pangea Shaker? You mean for your cooking?<</say>>
You're surprised, but it makes sense. With the wide variety of tastes within your expedition team, this Relic could be a cooking game-changer.

<<say $companionMaru>>Yes! Imagine, we could have any flavor we want, even in the middle of the Abyss! It's not like it's dangerous or anything, right? It could make our meals so much more... delightful!<</say>>
His enthusiasm is contagious, and you can see the joy sparking in his eyes. Cooking is a passion for Maru, and the Pangea Shaker could push his meals to new heights.

<<say $mc>>That's true, but what if we need it for something else?<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>>Oh, I promise to be really careful with it! And besides, isn't keeping our spirits high just as important? A tasty meal can do wonders for morale!<</say>>
Maru clasps his hands together, pleadingly looking at you with his big, round eyes.


:: Maru Pangea Yes

<<say $mc>>Alright, but remember, it's a valuable artifact. If there's even a hint of trouble, we'll have to put it away, okay?<</say>>
You give in, unable to resist Maru's earnest expression.

<<say $companionMaru>>Yay! You won't regret this, I promise! Prepare yourself for the most delicious meals you've ever tasted!<</say>>
Maru beams, excitement written all over his face as he reverently takes the Pangea Shaker into his hands. It seems like the Abyss is about to experience a culinary revolution.
<<set $maruPangea = 1>>

:: Maru Pangea No

<<say $mc>>I understand Maru, but we can't risk it. We don't know the full extent of this relic's abilities or if it has any side effects. It's too valuable to use for cooking.<</say>>
You're firm, believing in the caution that the unknown depths of the Abyss demand.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh, I... I see...<</say>>
Maru's eyes dim slightly, the rainbow glow of the Pangea Shaker flickering across his downcast face. His shoulders slump, hands slowly retracting from the relic.

<<say $mc>>I'm sorry, Maru. I know it's disappointing, but we have to be careful. The Abyss isn't a place for taking unnecessary risks.<</say>>
You try to offer him some comfort, but it's clear your decision weighs heavily on his spirit.

<<say $companionMaru>>No, no, it's okay... I understand. We're in the Abyss after all...<</say>>
Maru offers a weak smile, but it doesn't quite reach his eyes. His enthusiasm replaced by a sober understanding of the harsh environment you're all navigating.

:: Cherry Lambent Ask

Cherry's normally downcast eyes glint strangely in the half-light of the Abyss, her gaze fixed on the paper lantern held in your grasp. It is an unusual sight, this spark of life in the girl who seems to live in a constant state of melancholy.

<<say $companionCherry>>That's the Lambent Spectre, isn't it?<</say>>
Her voice is low, nearly drowned out by the whispering shadows of the Abyss.

You merely nod, unsure of where this conversation is leading.

<<say $companionCherry>>Can I ask a favor? I... I want to use it... for my sister.<</say>>
She hesitates, her words barely escaping the thin line of her mouth.

This request, sudden and loaded with potential danger, has you fumbling for words.

<<say $mc>>You mean... bring her back?<</say>>
You try to keep your voice steady, though the implications of her request send waves of uncertainty crashing over you.

She nods again, her eyes never leaving the delicate artifact.

<<say $companionCherry>>I know it might not be the same... might not be really her. But... she's all I have, you know? And I feel like I owe her this... this chance to exist again.<</say>>
Cherry's voice cracks a little, the raw emotion behind her words standing in stark contrast to her usual flat demeanor.

The sight of her vulnerability stirs a complex blend of emotions within you, but you can't ignore the voice of reason that echoes within your thoughts.

<<say $mc>>Cherry... I understand, but what if it's not healthy for you? What if it's not really her but just an imitation?<</say>>
She seems to consider your words, her gaze now dropping to her hands, twisted together nervously in her lap.

<<say $companionCherry>>I've... thought about it. A lot. But even if it's just a fraction of her... I think it could help. Help me to move on. I need to say goodbye. Properly this time.<</say>>
You sit silently, struggling to weigh the potential consequences against Cherry's desperate plea. It isn't an easy decision, but then again, nothing about this expedition through the Abyss is.

:: Cherry Lambent No

Your heart wrenches in your chest, seeing Cherry in such a state. But you know that you have to choose the path that seems the most reasonable, the one that feels less likely to cause any further harm.

<<say $mc>>Cherry, I... I can't. I understand why you'd want this... but I don't think it's the right path. This... isn't healthy.<</say>>
For a moment, silence hangs heavy between you. You see the spark that had briefly ignited in Cherry's eyes flicker out. Her gaze falls away from the Lambent Spectre, a quiet resignation returning to her features.

<<say $companionCherry>>I see... I suppose I had hoped... but it was a foolish hope.<</say>>
Her voice is soft, her words barely reaching your ears. She gives a slight nod, seemingly to herself more than you, a silent acknowledgment of your decision.

As she retreats into her usual solemn silence, you can tell that your refusal has affected her more deeply than her flat affect suggests. It is a blow that has further stoked the embers of her depression, a fact that makes your heart feel heavy with regret. But you have made your decision, one that you hope, in the long run, will prove to be the best for both of you.

:: Cherry Lambent Yes

Finally, with a deep sigh, you turn the Lambent Spectre over to Cherry, watching as her hands tremble slightly when she takes hold of it.

<<say $mc>>Alright, Cherry... but promise me, if it gets too much, if it's not what you expect, you'll stop.<</say>>
She nods, swallowing visibly. There is an uncharacteristic spark in her eyes, and you wonder if you have made the right decision. You watch as she cradles the lantern and closes her eyes, her lips moving in a silent plea.

A moment later, a flame sparks inside the lantern, flickering in an unseen breeze. But when a voice comes from it, it is a voice of a stranger, not her sister's. Cherry looks startled but quickly douses the flame with a vial of water she had prepared.

The process repeats itself, each time with a different voice, a different soul brought back from the unknown. With each attempt, Cherry's hope seems to fade a bit, replaced by a growing frustration and despair.

Watching her, you feel a twinge of regret. Seeing Cherry struggle in this way, cycling through souls in a desperate attempt to find her sister, you can't help but feel you have made the wrong choice. You consider stepping in, taking the lantern back, but a part of you is also telling you to let her keep trying. After all, isn't it her decision to make?

Caught in this internal debate, you finally decide to speak up.

<<say $mc>>Cherry...<</say>>
She doesn't seem to hear you, her focus solely on the lantern in her hands. Her determination is admirable, but also worrisome. Perhaps it is time for this experiment to end, for both Cherry's sake and for the sake of the souls accidentally called back. You prepare yourself for the tough conversation that is bound to follow.

:: Cherry Lambent Continues

You watch Cherry intently, her tireless efforts mirroring in the flickering light of the Lambent Spectre. With each failed attempt, her resolve only seems to strengthen. She moves in an almost mechanical fashion, extinguishing one flame just to summon another, hope dwindling with every unfamiliar voice.

You sit silently, torn between your concern and your respect for Cherry's determination. The decision is hers, but the desperation in her eyes, the despair in her voice, it all weighs heavily on you.

Finally, after what feels like an eternity, she stops. Her hand, once steady despite the tremor of emotion, is shaking. The lantern's light flickers and dies out, and Cherry doesn't attempt to rekindle it. Exhausted, she sinks back against the Abyss's cool stone, her eyes empty.

<<say $companionCherry>>It's... it's not working.<</say>>
Her voice is a ghost of a whisper, as if the futile attempts have drained her of more than just physical energy.

You remain quiet, unable to find words that would comfort her. She isn't looking for empty platitudes or reassurances, you know. She has sought solace in the impossible, and the disappointment is all too tangible.

<<say $companionCherry>>I... I just thought... maybe...<</say>>
Her voice trails off, a sob catching in her throat. The lantern slips from her grasp, rolling to a stop at your feet. But she doesn't move to retrieve it. Doesn't move at all.

<<say $mc>>I'm... I'm sorry, Cherry.<</say>>
It's all you can offer. Any other words feel inadequate, an intrusion on her grief.

The conversation ends there, a sorrowful silence stretching out between the two of you, as vast and deep as the Abyss itself.

:: Cherry Lambent Stops

<<say $mc>>Cherry... I think it's time to stop.<</say>>
You reach out gently to touch her shoulder, drawing her attention from the flickering lantern.

Her gaze lifts to meet yours, and you see the tears welling in her eyes. You pull the Lambent Spectre from her grasp and place it gently aside.

<<say $mc>>I know you miss your sister, and it's natural to want to see her again. But this... This isn't healthy. It's time to let go and try to move on.<</say>>
Cherry looks at you, her eyes searching yours, as if seeking an answer that she can't find in the flickering flames of the Spectre.

<<say $companionCherry>>But... it was my fault...<</say>>
Her voice is so small, a whisper of guilt and pain that tugs at your heart.

<<say $mc>>No, Cherry, it wasn't. It's just life... and sometimes, life is unfair and unpredictable.<</say>>
You offer the words gently, as if trying to keep them from bruising her further.

For a moment, Cherry is silent, simply looking at you with wide, tear-filled eyes. Then, a ragged breath slips from her lips and she drops her gaze, her fingers absent-mindedly twisting the edge of her shirt.

<<say $companionCherry>>But I shouldn't have been there... maybe I could have...<</say>>
She begins, her voice barely above a whisper, filled with a haunting echo of regret.

<<say $mc>>Cherry, there's no way you could have known what would happen. And dwelling on what you could have done differently won't change the past.<</say>>
You are firm, but your voice holds an empathetic warmth, recognizing the weight of her guilt.

Her breath hitches, and for a moment, you think she might break down. But she takes a deep breath and nods, wiping at her eyes with a shaky hand. You watch as a spark of resilience flickers within her, breaking through the fog of her sadness.

<<say $mc>>You can honor your sister by living, Cherry. By moving forward, by not letting your life be defined by her loss.<</say>>
She seems to consider your words, her gaze flickering towards the now silent Lambent Spectre. The moment is fragile, heavy with the pain of the past and the uncertainty of the future.

Feeling a surge of compassion, you move closer to Cherry, pulling her into a comforting embrace. Her body stiffens for a moment, before relaxing into your touch, her quiet sobs muffled against your shoulder.

<<say $companionCherry>>Maybe... Maybe you're right... Maybe it's time to move on.<</say>>
Her admission is hesitant, muffled into your shoulder, but it's a start. The smallest of smiles graces her lips as she pulls away from the hug, not one of happiness, but of acceptance. As you continue your expedition through the Abyss, you know that some changes are far more profound than those of the external world. And you hope Cherry's decision to move forward will lead her towards finding her inner peace.

:: Saeko Giddy Ask

You stand in the heart of the Abyss, the dim glow from the surroundings dancing on your skin. Saeko is beside you, her eyes wide with fascination as she surveys the alien vegetation around you. There's a unique flora that catches her attention; the Viridian Twinkle, a plant with iridescent leaves and a steady pulse as if the plant had a heartbeat of its own.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Fascinating, isn't it? The Viridian Twinkle. Its unique physiology allows it to pulse, pushing nutrients from its roots to its leaves. It's like it has its own cardiovascular system, despite not having any apparent pumping organ like a heart.<</say>>
Her eyes dance with the same glow as she observes the Abyss's unique vegetation. She's like a child in a candy shop, her excitement only rivaled by her scientific curiosity.

<<say $mc>>They're pretty cool, but what makes them so special?<</say>>
She turns to you, her face alight with the thrill of explaining her research. You can see the passion in her eyes as she delves into the explanation.

<<say $companionSaeko>>What makes them unique, you ask? Well, aside from their pulse-like circulatory mechanism, they also grow at an astonishing speed. This rapid regeneration is quite unusual, surpassing even fast growing surface plants like bamboo, and understanding how it works could revolutionize the way we think about plant life.<</say>>
Saeko shifts her gaze from the twinkling plant to the Giddy Reaper, nestled safely in your backpack.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I have a request. Would you mind if I use the Giddy Reaper on the Viridian Twinkle? It would allow me to study the rapid regeneration process in a more controlled environment. Don't worry, the plant will return to its previous height in just 12 hours, so if we make this our resting time for the day, we won't lose any time on our journey.<</say>>
She looks at you with pleading eyes as you consider your response.


:: Saeko Giddy Yes

The determined look on Saeko's face is met with your understanding nod. With a glimmer of gratitude in her eyes, she waits as you retrieve the Giddy Reaper from your backpack.

<<say $mc>>Alright, Saeko. You can use the Giddy Reaper. Just be careful with it.<</say>>
A look of relief spreads across her face. She handles the relic with a kind of reverence, tracing the edge of the sickle carefully before turning her gaze back to the Viridian Twinkle.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I'll handle it with utmost care. Thank you for this.<</say>>
With a gentle hand, she begins her work. The Giddy Reaper slices through the plant in a clean, precise motion. You watch as the plant falls apart, but there's no feeling of loss or destruction. Instead, there's a strange anticipation in the air. As if you're about to witness something remarkable.

<<say $mc>>Now what?<</say>>
Saeko’s gaze is fixed on the now-severed Viridian Twinkle, her hand still clutching the Giddy Reaper.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Now, we wait. The Giddy Reaper's effects should cause the plant to grow back fully in 12 hours. I’ll document every phase of the regeneration. This could provide us with invaluable insights about Abyssal flora. Once again, thank you. This could make a significant difference in my research.<</say>>
Her gratitude feels genuine and heartfelt. You can't help but smile at her enthusiasm. You stand beside her, both of you observing the Abyss's unique phenomena in silent awe. Even in the face of the unknown, there's an unspoken bond of trust between you two, deepened by shared experiences and a mutual curiosity for the Abyss's enigmatic beauty.


:: Saeko Giddy No

A moment of silence follows her request as you ponder over it. The gravity of her request is not lost on you, and after a brief pause, you shake your head.

<<say $mc>>No, Saeko. The Giddy Reaper stays with me.<</say>>
She blinks, taken aback by your refusal. Her wide eyes stare at you in confusion, as if she can't quite comprehend the rejection. Her hand moves instinctively towards her glasses, adjusting them in a nervous gesture.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Oh. I see...<</say>>
Her voice is barely a whisper, disappointment lacing her every word. The vibrant gleam in her eyes dims slightly, akin to a star that's lost its shine. She stares at the Viridian Twinkle for a moment longer, the glow of the plant reflecting off her glasses.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I understand, it's a valuable Relic. I just thought... well, no matter. Thank you for considering it.<</say>>
She turns away from the plant, her shoulders slightly slumped. There's a hint of resentment in her eyes, but it's overwhelmed a lingering sadness. She quickly turns away to hide her expression from you, so you don;t get a chance to observe her much longer.


:: Saeko Tranquility Ask

Exhausted from the day's journey, you and Saeko find a quiet spot to unwind amidst the unearthly wilderness of the Abyss. The subtle changes it wreaks on its explorers makes it an unpredictable and endlessly fascinating realm, and Saeko's scholarly interest in it seems only intensified by its constant state of flux.

<<say $companionSaeko>>You must be as tired as I am, right? We've covered quite some distance today.<</say>>
You notice a certain gentleness laced in her typically academic tone, her usual stoic exterior momentarily softened. Her gaze then flickers to your pack where the Tranquility Knell is secured.

<<say $companionSaeko>>May I propose a suggestion? Could we use the Tranquility Knell? The quiet it produces... It's an ideal environment for studying the Abyss' flora. My research notes could use some additional insights.<</say>>
Her request hangs in the air, a mixture of her professional drive and a hint of vulnerability seeping through. It's clear that despite the alien surroundings, Saeko finds a deep comfort in her scientific pursuits. The Abyss may be changing you both, but some things, like her commitment to her work, remain a steady constant.

<<say $mc>>...<</say>>
You regard her, your response unformed, taking a moment to reflect on her request. A still silence falls between the two of you, the quiet hum of the Abyss seeming to hold its breath.


:: Saeko Tranquility Yes

With your silent agreement, a small, appreciative smile plays on Saeko's lips. She reaches for the Tranquility Knell, the golden bell glowing faintly in her gentle grasp. You can see a spark of scholarly excitement glimmering in her eyes.

<<say $mc>>Sure, go ahead, Saeko. Maybe a little peace and quiet would do us good.<</say>>
The words are barely out of your mouth before she gives the bell a gentle shake. As the Tranquility Knell rings out, a veil of near-silence descends, the ambient noise of the Abyss receding to a whisper. It's an almost immediate shift, a sudden tranquility enveloping your shared space.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Thank you. I believe we will both benefit from this quiet. I will make sure to share any noteworthy findings with you.<</say>>
With the serenity provided by the Knell, Saeko turns her attention to the unique flora around. She pulls out her notes, pen moving swiftly across the pages as she records her observations. Even in this silence, you can almost make out her quiet hum of satisfaction, a testament to the wonder she finds in her researc.

<<say $mc>>Take your time, Saeko. We have this silence, and we have this moment.<</say>>
You settle down, watching Saeko delve into her research with an uncontained enthusiasm. The quiet peacefulness fostered by the Tranquility Knell, and the shared companionship with Saeko in this ever-changing Abyss, offers a small yet comforting sense of stability.


:: Saeko Tranquility No

A hint of hesitation lingers on your features as you finally respond.

<<say $mc>>I'm sorry, Saeko, but I think we should save the Tranquility Knell. We don't know what we might face later on.<</say>>
The anticipation in Saeko's eyes dims, her gaze flicking back down to her notes with a small frown etching into her features. The disappointment is clear, yet she attempts to mask it with a nod of understanding.

<<say $companionSaeko>>You're right. We must prioritize our safety above all else.<</say>>
There's a certain stiffness to her tone, the academic shell reassembling itself around her. Despite her understanding, you could tell your decision has let her down. A silent agreement of sorts, as her focus once again becomes the Abyss and its mysteries, her disappointment quietly tucked away.

<<say $mc>>...<</say>>
Silently, you watch Saeko as she returns to her work, the ambient noise of the Abyss filling the silence. In this strange place decisions like these, necessary as they may be, seem to only make the journey a bit more challenging.


:: Cherry Smitten Ask

Cherry's sunken eyes seem to hold a world of resignation, the usual flatness of her tone replaced by a note of weariness you've become all too familiar with on this journey through the Abyss. Her hair falls limply over her face, hiding part of her expression from view.

<<say $companionCherry>>I've been thinking, do you think I could use the Smitten Mitt? Just... just for a little comfort, you know.<</say>>
The mention of the Smitten Mitt adds a peculiar kind of silence to the moment, its presence having the strange weight of unspoken stories, of hopeful desires. Her hands fumble with a bit of torn fabric, a small act of anxiety that seems at odds with her usual apathetic demeanor.

<<say $mc>>Is there a particular reason you want the Smitten Mitt?<</say>>
Her shoulders tense slightly, almost imperceptible under the fabric of her worn-out clothes. An oddity in the usually apathetic girl, this hint of vulnerability is unusual and concerning.

<<say $companionCherry>>I just... It's been a while since I felt anything... soft, or kind. And you said it feels like holding a hand, right? Like someone's there with you.<</say>>


:: Cherry Smitten Yes

There's a stillness that stretches between you, a tension that lingers around the idea of the Smitten Mitt. Then, your affirmation finally breaks the silence.

<<say $mc>>Alright, Cherry. You can use the Smitten Mitt.<</say>>
The air shifts, the unspoken consent seems to lighten the tension. She reaches for the Smitten Mitt with a languid slowness. As her hand slides into the relic, her eyes flicker closed momentarily, her face tilting up slightly, as if basking in the strange sensation. A soft sigh escapes her lips, a sound not of contentment, but of some small relief.

The Smitten Mitt, an object so innocuous yet strangely profound, works its magic. It gives her the sensation of holding a warm, comforting human hand. It's like an echo of a memory, a vague but tangible comfort amidst the unease of their expedition.

When Cherry's eyes open again, there's a small change in them. Still tired, still resigned, but with a hint of something else - a fleeting moment of peace, perhaps.

<<say $companionCherry>>It's strange. It doesn't feel real, but at the same time it does. It's like... like holding onto a ghost. An echo of something comforting. It doesn't change anything, but it... helps. Somehow.<</say>>
Her voice drifts off, words lost in the thoughts that continue to swirl inside her head. But for the moment, in the harsh and changing reality of the Abyss, the Smitten Mitt offers a small respite, a flicker of humanity amidst the unfathomable depths.


:: Cherry Smitten No

Cherry's request hangs in the air, a strange sensation of longing for a semblance of human connection. Her gaze is locked onto the worn-out fabric in her hands, as if it holds answers to questions she dares not ask.

<<say $mc>>Cherry, I understand why you might want to use the Smitten Mitt, but... it's not real. It won't provide you with genuine comfort and I don't think it would be good for you in the long term.<</say>>
You watch her closely, your words dropping like heavy stones into the silence that follows. Her eyelashes flutter, almost imperceptibly, as if shielding her from the reality of your words.

Her hands pause in their anxious fumbling and drop to her sides. Her head bows slightly as if accepting a harsh verdict. You notice a fine tremor running through her, a testament to the weight your words have carried.

<<say $companionCherry>>Oh, I see... Yeah, I guess you're right. I just thought... never mind.<</say>>
Her voice is smaller, hollow, devoid of even the faintest inflection of hope she had earlier. A palpable wave of disappointment rolls off her, her normally dull eyes now tinged with a deep, almost indiscernible sadness. Her head bows lower, a gesture of surrender to the painful reality of your denial. The ever-present weight of the Abyss seems to press down on her more heavily, a despairing reminder of the isolation that pervades this strange place.


:: Lily Acrobatic Ask

In the silence that settles between you, Lily begins to fidget with the strap of her backpack, her eyes sparkling with a glint of mischief. 

<<say $companionLily>>Hey, you know that Acrobatic Accord thingamajig we found earlier? I've been thinking...maybe I could, like, take it for a spin?<</say>>
Her fingers trace the air in a series of hypothetical loops and swirls, as if imagining the potential gravity-defying stunts she could pull off. She beams at you with unbridled enthusiasm, her energy infectious.

Her eyes remain fixed on you, shining with a mixture of excitement and curiosity, as she awaits your reaction. The normally chirpy Lily seems oddly silent, her heart pounding in her chest as she anxiously waits for your answer. She knows the potential dangers of the relics from the Abyss, but she also knows the thrill it offers is unlike any other.

<<say $mc>>You mean you want to use the Acrobatic Accord? Just for fun?<</say>>
You raise an eyebrow, surprise coloring your tone. Though you're aware of Lily's love for adventure and excitement, the proposition is still somewhat unexpected. The Acrobatic Accord isn't a toy, after all. 

Lily's enthusiasm doesn't waver in the face of your skepticism. If anything, your words seem to fuel her excitement even further. She meets your gaze head on, her smile unwavering as she readies herself for the next part of her persuasion.

<<say $companionLily>>Well, why not? I mean, imagine the stunts I could pull off with it! You've got to admit, it would be pretty rad, right?<</say>>
Her words hang in the air, an open invitation, a challenge to throw caution to the wind and embrace the unpredictable journey through the Abyss. Yet, you remain silent, leaving her to linger in suspense as the moments tick by.


:: Lily Acrobatic Yes

The silence drags on for a bit, before your lips twitch into a smile. Lily's excitement is simply contagious, it's hard to not get swept up in it.

<<say $mc>>Alright, alright. You've convinced me. Let's see what you can do with that Acrobatic Accord.<</say>>
A victorious laugh escapes her as she pumps a fist in the air. The air around her seems to vibrate with her giddy anticipation.

<<say $companionLily>>Awesome! You won't regret this, promise!<</say>>
Without further ado, she slips the delicate anklet around her ankle, closing her eyes for a brief moment as she savors the unfamiliar sensation. Then, in the blink of an eye, she bursts into action.

Lily starts off simple, with a series of cartwheels that progress into handsprings, then fluidly transitions into walkovers. Her movements are so graceful, so fluid that they seem to blur the line between reality and some sort of magical dance.

She performs a succession of aerial flips, twisting and contorting her body mid-air with a level of finesse that defies logic. Each landing is as smooth as silk, not a single movement wasted or out of place. 

Then, she tries something even more daring: she scales a nearby tree like some sort of spider, her hands and feet moving with equal ease. She balances precariously on a slender branch, standing on one hand while her legs form a perfect split in the air. Her free hand waves to you, a cheeky grin adorning her face.

<<say $companionLily>>How's this for a show, eh?<</say>>
She then launches herself off the branch, twisting and turning in the air before nimbly landing on her feet. The finale is a series of rapid flips, with such speed and precision it almost seems like she's flying.

As she finally comes to a halt, panting and flushed, there's a spark of pure joy in her eyes that leaves you speechless. The sight of Lily, having pushed the limits of what seemed possible, fills you with a strange mixture of awe and respect. The Acrobatic Accord isn't a toy, but in her hands (or rather, on her ankle), it becomes a tool for creating unforgettable moments of beauty and excitement.


:: Lily Acrobatic No

Seeing her excitement, you almost want to say yes, to indulge in the thrill she so eagerly seeks. But you understand the gravity of the situation better. The Abyss isn't a playground, and relics like the Acrobatic Accord aren't toys.

<<say $mc>>Lily, it's not that simple. The Acrobatic Accord isn't something we should be messing around with for fun.<</say>>
Your words strike a chord, and Lily's grin fades. Her fingers halt their animated dance, and she looks at you, her bright eyes dimming slightly. Disappointment mingles with annoyance on her face.

<<say $companionLily>>Aw, come on! Don't be such a buzzkill. We've been trudging around in this weird place, dealing with all sorts of freaky stuff. We should be having fun when we're exploring somewhere like this!<</say>>
Her disappointment is evident, the excitement in her eyes replaced by a touch of frustration. But she doesn't push it further, respecting your decision despite her obvious annoyance. There is a newfound tension in the air between you, a sense of disappointment that makes the silence all the more deafening.

<<say $mc>>I understand, Lily. But it's not about fun. It's about being responsible and making sure we can handle the unexpected. This isn't a game.<</say>>
Your words hang heavy in the air. Lily's radiant eyes look back at you, her face morphing from a playful grin to a contemplative expression. She remains silent for a moment, weighing her words carefully before speaking up.

<<say $companionLily>>You're right, this isn't a game. It's life. And life is short, right? Too short to just worry about responsibilities and unexpected turns all the time. Isn't that why we're here? To explore, to experience new things?<</say>>
Her words echo in the silence, drawing a thoughtful look from you. Lily takes a deep breath, her eyes reflecting her sincerity.

<<say $companionLily>>Listen, I get it. The Abyss is dangerous and unpredictable. I know. But so is life. And if we just keep worrying about what might go wrong, we'll forget to enjoy what's going right. That's why I want to use the Acrobatic Accord. Not just because it's fun, but because it represents the spirit of living, of finding joy in even the strangest and scariest of circumstances.<</say>>
Her words hang in the air, filled with an infectious optimism and a sense of life-affirming adventure. Her expression is serious, but her eyes dance with an undeniable excitement. The air seems to buzz with energy as she looks at you, waiting for a response to her heartfelt declaration. 

<<say $mc>>That's... a way of looking at it, Lily. I'll... I'll think about it.<</say>>
Your words are met with a bright smile, the air of tension dissipating as her enthusiasm seeps back in. Even if she didn't get a firm yes, the promise of consideration is enough for her to regain her lively spirit.

<<say $companionLily>>Great! That's all I'm asking for. Now, shall we continue our adventure?<</say>>
As she bounds ahead, her energy is infectious, and despite the uncertainty, you can't help but appreciate her spirit. It's a stark reminder of the vibrant and unexpected delights the Abyss has to offer if one dares to embrace it.
