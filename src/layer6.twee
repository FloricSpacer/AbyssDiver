!Layer 6 - Cinders of Dis
@@The first hint of the sixth layer is a strong smell of smoke overwhelming your nostrils - a savory, meaty kind of smoke, almost like the smell of barbeque. It almost feels like the flowers beneath you are caressing your feet, but the air gets hotter and hotter as you head further down, and as the flowers begin to become charred and burned awar, the real culprit becomes clear: a squirming carpet of tentacles, thousands or millions of tiny villi completely covering almost every surface on the path ahead, forming an entire field of squirming creatures.

They grow taller as you proceed, until you're wading through a thicket or navel-high tentacles, prodding and rubbing against your most sensitive areas. By this point, the heat has become truly intense, almost sauna-like. It's so hot that great swathes of the tentacle fields are actually aflame, thousands of tendrils being birned away and perpetually springing up again, a land of flesh doused in fire: a perfect vision of Hell. Some of the fire are in a familiar orange-red hue, while other come in more exotic greens, pinks, and purples, only lightly tickling when they lap at your skin. Small pieces of rubble, perhaps of some ancient structures, litter the layer...but the tentacles and flames have long since crushed and burned them into unrecognizable, meaningless rock.

	As you walk through a field of charred flower-like tentacles, you notice a peculiar creature wriggling through the sea of tentacles. It looks like a snake, but its body is covered in tiny suction cups, leaving a trail of wet spots on the ground. The creature seems unbothered by the heat and flames, and it slithers past you without a second glance.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 2>>
	As you venture deeper into the layer, the heat grows more intense, and the air becomes thick with the savory scent of smoke. You come across a small clearing, where the tentacles have given way to a bubbling, steaming hot spring. The water appears inviting, but upon closer inspection, you notice that it's filled with writhing tentacles, gently caressing and coiling around each other. Deciding it's not worth the risk, you continue on your way.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 3>>
	As you wade through the sea of tentacles, you come across a peculiar sight: a lone tree, its branches swaying with the movements of the writhing tendrils below. The tree's bark is gnarled and blackened, as if it has been scorched by the intense heat, but it somehow still manages to stand tall amidst the chaos. You notice that the tentacles seem to avoid the tree, creating a small, temporary reprieve from the relentless groping.<br><br>

	<<set $cool=1>>
	You put on the self-cooling clothes. The romer stones that you incorperated in it feel like small airconditioning units although the clothes are light they still cover you very well and soon you feel them cool your entire body. You feel like you could run a mile in these clothes and still not overheat in this hellish landscape you find yourself. It looks like you'll be able to cover more distance wearing this than you would normally be able to, reducing all travel costs on this layer by 1 day.<br><br>

<<elseif $dollevent2 && $coolCloth>>

	By now you have accepted that you can't take of the tattered pink dress. But when you try to put the self-cooling clothes over your tattered dress you faint, only to wake up with the summer clothes off and neatly folded in your hands again. Looking at the doll you swear you can see it grinning at you. It seems you are stuck sweating it out in this worn down dress. If only it would be little hoter so that acursed doll would go up in flames..<br><br>

<<elseif $dollevent2 && !$coolCloth>>
	Dressed in only your tattered pink dress you feel very exposed to the heat on this layer. You whish you had something cooler and more insulating to wear to protect you. At the same time you wonder if you could even wear something else now that you are in this Cursed dress. Damn that doll..<br><br>

While the Fell Dragons are immune to most conventional methods of attack, you can combine the power of the Toral Wave with the Empath Coil to electrocute the dragon.

In an incredible collaboration with colleagues on the surface, Saeko managed to develop some incredibly innovative water filtration techniques.

	As the Leaky Curse takes hold of you, the effects are more subtle than you might have expected.
	
	There's no dramatic flash of arousal or some sudden change. In general, you just feel pretty good. However, over the next few minutes you gradually become aware that your loins are turning into one giant sticky swamp that's draining down your legs. A trickle of precum is oozing out of your penis and mixing with a steady dribbling coming out of your sopping vagina. 
	
	The mingling fluids spark a moment of concern; you haven't taken any Curses that would render you self-fertile, right?
	
	Regardless, you must find a solution to prevent leaving a trail that would not only annoy others but also make tracking you a breeze for predators in the Abyss. 
	
	If you ever happen to get aroused, would ultra-absorbent sanitary pads suffice for this deluge, or would you need to resort to diapers to hold back the flood of fluids? The prospect of living with this Curse just became much more challenging.

	There's no dramatic flash of arousal or some sudden change. In general, you just feel pretty good. You shrug your shoulders and continue about your business for a bit, but about half and hour later you notice something. Your penis, your balls, and even your thighs have started getting sticky, and as you reach down to check out what's going on you realize they've all become slick with precum. 
	
	It's not a dramatic event, but a constant, minor flow of precum from the tip of your cock. It's so subtle that it would go unnoticed if not for the accumulating wetness. The continuous emission prevents it from drying, so you won't inadvertently adhere your penis to objects. However, managing this newfound predicament will be tricky. You're going to have to stop frequently to clean yourself up, or put something over your penis that you change frequently to catch the drips, or...
	
	The best thing for this might really be those sanitary pads women use for their periods. Barring that, some kind of diaper. Unless of course you just want to spend all your time soaked in sticky clothes or run around naked letting your penis drip on the ground.

You find a secluded place to check your crotch, but a quick obervation revelas you are totally soaked with sexual fluids.
	
	After another five minutes and you realize you will need to do something about the trickle down your leg in case you ever get aroused for any reason. Maybe some combination of super absorbant sanitary pads would be sufficient to control this at a manageable level?
	
	If you don't want your vaginal juices dribbling down your legs whenever you get even slightly aroused, soaking whatever clothes you have, then you're going to have do do something drastic. Maybe even diapers would be required if the flow got too extreme and you were aroused for a long enough period of time.
<<else>>
	As the Leaky Curse takes hold of you, you don't notice anything different. Maybe that's not really surprising considering you don't have any genitals anymore the Curse can affect. Now that you're thinking about it, you seem to drool a little bit. Did the curse affect your mouth because you don't have genitals? Or are you just drooling because you started thinking about genitals you no longer possess? It can be hard to tell, but your mouth definitely seems more moist than it used to be.

While the Fell Dragons are immune to most conventional methods of attack, you can combine the power of the Toral Wave with the Empath Coil to electrocute the dragon.

If you allow it to overpower you, you will be completely ravaged by the enormous beast.

While the Fell Dragons are immune to most conventional methods of attack, you can combine the power of the Toral Wave with the Empath Coil to electrocute the dragon. A single touch can stun the dragon, allowing follow-up attacks that can take it down. This method is only likely to work once, but it can effective. Even this method isn't safe though, leaving you with minor injuries that will increase your next 3 travel times by 2 days each.<br>

You can appease the dragon by offering it 100 dubloons. It would graciously allow you to live and keep the rest of your hoard if you want, though keep in mind another one might come your way if you're still holding enough to attract them in 8 days.<br>
	[[Offer 100 dubloons to appease the dragon|Layer6 Exit2][$dubloons -= 100]]<br><br>
If you try to run away without fighting to keep your dubloons safe, prepare to be severely burned before you manage to get away. This will increase all travel times by 4 days until you can get it healed and it will take 2 medkits to heal it!<br>

	You can take it down effectively with a gun, but you'll need at least 19 bullets to take it down due its amorphous form and enormous size. But even despite those limitations, a ranged weapon like a gun is probably the safest way to take one of these down.<br>

If you allow it to overpower you, you will be completely ravaged by the enormous beast.

Suddenly, the ground beneath you shudders, and a sense of impending doom washes over you. The wriggling carpet of tentacles you've been traversing parts to reveal a colossal creature, the greater tentacle beast.

Your pulse quickens, adrenaline flooding your veins as you struggle to comprehend the enormity of the creature before you.

	The relentless invasion of the tendrils sends wave after wave of pleasure coursing through your body, a dizzying blend of ecstasy and agony that threatens to shatter your sanity. The beast's tendrils fill your every orifice, pulsating and writhing with an insatiable hunger that you cannot deny. The heat of the surrounding flames only serves to intensify the experience, their exotic colors casting a sensual glow on your entwined bodies.

	As you lose yourself in the depths of pleasure, a part of you knows that you've surrendered to the greater tentacle beast. The thought of being left immobile for twelve days in this hellish environment is a distant concern, dwarfed by the relentless torrent of ecstasy that threatens to drown you. But in this moment, with your body and mind utterly consumed by the beast's advances, there is no room for fear or regret.

	As the greater tentacle beast's relentless assault on your senses continues, the line between pleasure and pain begins to blur. Your body trembles with each new wave of ecstasy, your muscles straining against the slick tendrils that hold you captive. The scent of the savory smoke and the heat of the exotic flames have become a distant backdrop, overshadowed by the all-consuming sensations that the beast elicits within you.

	Gradually, the intensity of the experience begins to ebb. The tendrils, which had been pulsating and writhing with such fervor, start to slow their movements, becoming more languid and deliberate. The numbing liquid that had dulled your pain receptors starts to dissipate, and the once-overwhelming sensations are replaced by a gentle, soothing caress.

	You can feel the greater tentacle beast's grip on your body loosening, its tendrils untangling and retreating one by one. As each tendril releases you, a cool sensation washes over your exposed skin, a stark contrast to the sweltering heat that surrounds you. The exotic flames seem to dim, their hypnotic hues fading to a mere flicker as you are gradually released from the beast's embrace.

	As the last of the tendrils slips away, you collapse to the ground, your body a trembling, sweat-slicked mass of spent nerves and exhausted muscles. You draw in deep, ragged breaths, your lungs aching for the oxygen they had been so cruelly denied. The once-overpowering scent of smoke now serves as a grounding reminder of your surroundings, a faint anchor to reality amidst the chaos of your recent ordeal.

	Despite the lingering exhaustion, a sense of relief and freedom washes over you as you realize that the greater tentacle beast has released you. The taste of survival is bittersweet, a complex mixture of gratitude, fear, and the lingering remnants of pleasure that still cling to your nerve endings. You know that the coming $tentacleFucked days will be a challenge, your body weakened and vulnerable, but you are determined to press onward.
<<else>>\
	<<set $khemiaFucked = 0>>\
	In a flash, the greater tentacle beast lunges toward your party. Khemia leaps into action, his sword slicing through the air with precision and power. The beast's tendrils reach out hungrily, but Khemia's swift movements keep them at bay. He weaves and dodges, his blade severing tendrils with each graceful swing.

	Despite Khemia's skill and strength, the sheer number of tendrils proves to be a challenge. A rogue tendril manages to slip past his defenses, coiling around his leg and yanking him off balance. Khemia grits his teeth in pain as the tendril tightens its grip, leaving deep, dark bruises on his tanned skin.

	With a determined roar, Khemia slashes at the offending tendril, severing it from the beast's massive form. The creature recoils, releasing Khemia and retreating into the depths of the Abyss. The severed tendrils around him twitch and wither, their fleshy colors fading to a dull, lifeless gray.

	You and your party members rush to Khemia's side, helping him to his feet. His injuries are painful but not life-threatening, a testament to his skill and determination. Together, you continue your journey through the Abyss, the memory of the greater tentacle beast's lustful hunger and Khemia's heroic stand forever etched in your minds.

[[Return to exploring the sixth layer|$returnPassage]]


:: Layer6 Dragon Encounter [layer6 nobr]

As you wade through the navel-high tentacles, your senses are assaulted by the heat and the suffocating smell of smoke. The once-solid path is replaced by a squirming, undulating carpet of tendrils, some alight with exotic-colored flames that gently caress your skin. Amidst the infernal landscape, you suddenly catch sight of a large, imposing figure: the fell dragon.


:: Layer6 Threat2 [layer6]
<<set $timeL6T2 -= 8>>
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/felldragon.png']]

The dragon's immense presence is nearly tangible, and the air seems to crackle with tension. You stand transfixed as the fell dragon unfurls its wings, casting sinister shadows upon the scorched earth. Its eyes lock onto yours, and you feel the weight of its ancient, malevolent intelligence bearing down on you. The dragon's breath hisses as it exhales, and you taste the acrid tang of sulfur and ozone, sharp against your tongue.

With a heart-pounding realization, you remember the hoard of dubloons you carry. The fell dragon senses your wealth, and its eyes narrow with greed. You know that the creature will not rest until it has claimed your gold for its own, and you must make a choice: appease its wrath with a hefty offering, fight the monstrous beast, or flee and risk the searing pain of its flames.

As the dragon's maw opens, revealing a churning, swirling vortex of multicolored fire, you steel yourself for the decision that could determine your fate in this unforgiving layer of the Abyss.

<<nobr>>
<<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Sunbeam") && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Khemia") && $khemiaDragon == 1>>
The dragon takes care to avoid Khemia at close range, so he won't have a chance to use Sunbeam this time, at least not if he wants to make it out alive. <br><br>
<</if>>
<<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Sunbeam") && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Khemia") && $khemiaDragon == 0>>
	Khemia has enough expertise with a blade that if you give him the Sunbeam Relic he will be able to fight it off one time, but even he would be moderately burned by fighting it, increasing all travel times by 2 until you used a medkit on him. You will be able to get it's hoard of 50 dubloons when you kill it though.<br>
	[[Have Khemia fight it off with Sunbeam|$returnPassage][$status.duration = 99, $status.penalty = 2, $khemiaDragon == 1, $dubloons += 50, $dragonKill += 1]]<br><br>
<</if>>
<<if $joyousSword == 1 && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Khemia") && $khemiaDragon == 0>>
	Khemia has enough expertise with a blade that if you give him the Joyous Sunder sword he will be able to defeat a dragon with only minor burns, increasing your next 3 travel times by 2 days each.<br>
	[[Have Khemia fight it off with Sunbeam|$returnPassage][$status.duration = 3, $status.penalty = 2, $khemiaDragon == 1, $dubloons += 50, $dragonKill += 1]]<br><br>
<</if>>
<<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Toral Wave") && $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Empath Coil") && $electricDragon == 0>>
While the Fell Dragons are immune to most conventional methods of attack, you can combine the power of the Toral Wave with the Empath Coil to electrocute the dragon. A single touch can stun the dragon, allowing follow-up attacks that can take it down. This method is only likely to work once, but it can effective. Even this method isn't safe though, leaving you with minor injuries that will increase your next 3 travel times by 2 days each.<br>
	[[Use your Relics to electrocute the dragon|$returnPassage][$status.duration = 3, $status.penalty = 2, $electricDragon == 1, $dubloons += 50, $dragonKill += 1]]<br><br>
<</if>>
You can appease the dragon by offering it 100 dubloons. It would graciously allow you to live and keep the rest of your hoard if you want, though keep in mind another one might come your way if you're still holding enough to attract them in 8 days.<br>
	[[Offer 100 dubloons to appease the dragon|$returnPassage][$dubloons -= 100]]<br><br>
If you try to run away without fighting to keep your dubloons safe, prepare to be severely burned before you manage to get away. This will increase all travel times by 4 days until you can get it healed and it will take 2 medkits to heal it!<br>
	[[Try to run and accept the consequences|$returnPassage][$status.duration = 99, $status.penalty = 4, $dubloons += 50, $dragonBurn = 1]]<br><br>
<</nobr>>

Use the following option only if you have specifically considered your inventory and made a plan of how to use what you have to take down a worm. You may only use each combination 1 time before the dragons learn from experience and overcome the weakness, making that strategy unusable a second time.
[[Use a combination of Relics not mentioned above you believe would be able to overpower one of the dragons|$returnPassage][$dragonKill += 1, $dubloons += 50]]
