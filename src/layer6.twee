!Layer 6 - Cinders of Dis
@@The first hint of the sixth layer is a strong smell of smoke overwhelming your nostrils - a savory, meaty kind of smoke, almost like the smell of barbeque. It almost feels like the flowers beneath you are caressing your feet, but the air gets hotter and hotter as you head further down, and as the flowers begin to become charred and burned away, the real culprit becomes clear: a squirming carpet of tentacles, thousands or millions of tiny villi completely covering almost every surface on the path ahead, forming an entire field of squirming creatures.

They grow taller as you proceed, until you're wading through a thicket or navel-high tentacles, prodding and rubbing against your most sensitive areas. By this point, the heat has become truly intense, almost sauna-like. It's so hot that great swathes of the tentacle fields are actually aflame, thousands of tendrils being burned away and perpetually springing up again, a land of flesh doused in fire: a perfect vision of Hell. Some of the fire are in a familiar orange-red hue, while other come in more exotic greens, pinks, and purples, only lightly tickling when they lap at your skin. Small pieces of rubble, perhaps of some ancient structures, litter the layer... but the tentacles and flames have long since crushed and burned them into unrecognizable, meaningless rock.

	As you walk through a field of charred flower-like tentacles, you notice a peculiar creature wriggling through the sea of tentacles. It looks like a snake, but its body is covered in tiny suction cups, leaving a trail of wet spots on the ground. The creature seems unbothered by the heat and flames, and it slithers past you without a second glance.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 2>>
	As you venture deeper into the layer, the heat grows more intense, and the air becomes thick with the savory scent of smoke. You come across a small clearing, where the tentacles have given way to a bubbling, steaming hot spring. The water appears inviting, but upon closer inspection, you notice that it's filled with writhing tentacles, gently caressing and coiling around each other. Deciding it's not worth the risk, you continue on your way.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 3>>
	As you wade through the sea of tentacles, you come across a peculiar sight: a lone tree, its branches swaying with the movements of the writhing tendrils below. The tree's bark is gnarled and blackened, as if it has been scorched by the intense heat, but it somehow still manages to stand tall amidst the chaos. You notice that the tentacles seem to avoid the tree, creating a small, temporary reprieve from the relentless groping.<br><br>

<</if>>

<<if $coolCloth && !$dollevent2>>
	You put on the self-cooling clothes. The Rømer Stones that you incorporated in it feel like small air conditioning units although the clothes are light they still cover you very well and soon you feel them cool your entire body. You feel like you could run a mile in these clothes and still not overheat in this hellish landscape you find yourself. It looks like you'll be able to cover more distance wearing this than you would normally be able to, reducing all travel costs on this layer by 1 day.<br><br>

<<elseif $dollevent2 && $coolCloth>>
	By now you have accepted that you can't take of the tattered pink dress. But when you try to put the self-cooling clothes over your tattered dress you faint, only to wake up with the summer clothes off and neatly folded in your hands again. Looking at the doll you swear you can see it grinning at you. It seems you are stuck sweating it out in this worn down dress. If only it would be little hotter so that accursed doll would go up in flames..<br><br>

<<elseif $dollevent2 && !$coolCloth>>
	Dressed in only your tattered pink dress you feel very exposed to the heat on this layer. You wish you had something cooler and more insulating to wear to protect you. At the same time you wonder if you could even wear something else now that you are in this Cursed dress. Damn that doll..<br><br>

<h1>Foraging</h1>

<p>The listed foraging options, naturally, are not an exhaustive list of every flora and fauna to be found in this immense hole, but they are, for a variety of reasons, the only ones that will be helpful to you on your quest for food and water. Maybe other food exists, but is laced with too much poison to be edible from a practical standpoint for one on a journey with limited supplies, or perhaps they're edible but offer even more severe transformative effects than the listed foods, or they're extremely rare and impractical to collect for meals, or there's edible fauna but with extremely effective defense mechanisms, or there's perfectly edible options that just aren't around at the time of year (or decade, or century - the Abyss has much stranger and more unpredictable seasons than the surface) you're here... the list goes on. Whatever the reasons, the listed foods are definitely your best foraging options in each layer.</p>

<p>If you decide to start foraging for food or water, it means that you will not consume your stored food rations or water supply while consuming time on tasks in this layer, but you will not obtain more supplies by starting to forage here.</p>

There is a very easily accessible source of water on this layer, the River Dycx, which is bright red and leaves a cinnamon-like aftertaste in your mouth. Unfortunately it also leaves a bit of a burning hole in your heart, causing you to gain an additional jinxed flame counter for each day of water you drink here, making it even more unpleasant to leave.

	As you press through the thicket of incessantly writhing tentacles, the tentacles subtly change their rhythm. The heat has long ago seared your sense of comfort away, replaced with a strange duality of torment and transcendence. The harsh, yet strangely savory, scent of burning flesh punctuates the air, becoming richer and more distinct. Suddenly, the sea of tentacles parts like the Red Sea before Moses, revealing a broad expanse of barren rock.

	Before you yawns the Maw of Kimaris, a monstrous mouth carved into the very earth. The sight seizes your breath, casting you into a sudden, terrible silence. The Maw seems to pulse with a horrifying life of its own, promising an eternal fall to any who would dare to trip at its precipice.

The heat of the Abyss’ sixth layer washes over you like a relentless wave, soaking your clothes through, making your skin glisten with a film of sweat in the otherworldly glow of multicolored flames. You breathe in the rich, smoky aroma, a scent that is strangely enticing, tickling your taste buds and making your stomach growl with a yearning you hadn't expected in this harsh environment.

As you head deeper, a shiver runs down your spine, a silent precursor to the change that has started coursing through you. The heat, once simply external, seeps into your very core, wrapping you in its embrace, a seductive pull that you find yourself unable to resist.

It's as if a hidden doorway opens within you, and an inviting warmth pours out, flooding you with a feeling so powerful it threatens to sweep you off your feet. This new sensation, rich and all-consuming, is so much deeper than your prior submission, an amplification that turns the gentle surrender you were used to into a total capitulation to the one who is dominating you.

Every instinct in your body feels as though it has been tuned to a higher frequency, turning the mere touch of the tentacles into electrifying sensations. Each caress, each prod against your sensitive skin, sets off a cascade of pleasure that leaves you gasping and aching for more. 

You find yourself in an almost perpetual state of compliance, any semblance of dominance drained away, replaced with an almost serene acceptance of this new reality.

This new level of submission, this newfound inability to resist any request that doesn't threaten your life, is an unexpected evolution in your journey. It makes you feel exposed, vulnerable, yet it also brings a kind of release, a freedom from the need to assert control, to resist. There's an excitement, a delicious sense of anticipation, that churns within your stomach as you consider what this means for your expedition, for your future.
<<else>>\
The heat of the sixth layer of the Abyss presses in on you as you descend further, your clothes soaked through with a sheen of sweat, the harsh light from the multicolored flames reflecting off your damp skin. The heat and smoke all around you, laced with an odd, sweetly savory aroma that makes your stomach growl despite your trepidation, bears down on you. It feels like walking into a brick wall, a barrier that shouldn't be here, yet is.

A sudden shiver travels through you, the subtle shift within you a warning of a change coming too late to stop. As the heat intensifies, you can't shake the feeling that it's not just the external temperature that's changing, but something inside you as well.

A wave of languor, hot and inviting like the flames that surround you, pools deep within your stomach, spreading outwards. It seeps into you, tugging at your will, your strength, softening your resolve into something pliant and tender. Your eyes feel heavy, your thoughts slow, clouded with the strange sensation. There's a growing sense of acquiescence, a dulcet whisper of surrender that flutters at the back of your mind, silencing your usual voice of determination and control.

It's an unsettling feeling, like you're losing a part of yourself, being reshaped into something different, but it’s oddly soothing, too. You're suddenly hyper-aware of the way the tendrils squirm against you, and a shiver courses through your spine, despite the intense heat. You can feel each individual tendril on your skin, their touch strangely enticing. Their exploratory caresses are no longer a source of unease, but instead, they stroke a warm current of satisfaction through your body, a hedonistic pleasure that makes you sigh.

Confusion tugs at you, but it's easy to brush it aside, to let the whispering voice of the Curse smooth over your uncertainties. You stop fighting against the curious tendrils, the soft press of your body against theirs, the way they prod and press into your most sensitive areas. The heat around you is all-consuming, but it's comforting in a way, a reminder of the warmth pooling within you.

You look around the torrid landscape, eyes squinting against the myriad of colorful flames that surround you. Your heart aches, but in a strange, almost pleasant way. You know you should be leading the expedition as you always have, but this newfound submission fills you with an odd sense of contentment. 

In the burning world around you, your mind reels at the changes, at the loss of control and the unfamiliar feelings spreading through you. You can't help but wonder what this will mean for your journey, for your future. Will you be forever subject to the desires of others, to the whims of the Abyss? Despite your uncertainty, you can't deny the thrill that tingles at the thought, the shiver of anticipation at the unknown path that lies before you.

<<if $mc.hasCurse("Lactation Rejuvenation A")>>\
The sensation of constant lactation has become second nature to you, like the beating of your heart or the rhythm of your breath. But as you move deeper into the sixth layer, you sense a strange stirring within you, a wave of warmth that begins at your chest and diffuses throughout your body. It feels almost like a prickling under your skin, a discomforting tightness that rapidly escalates into an undeniable throbbing.

Looking down, you see the front of your shirt clinging to your chest, utterly soaked. The fabric is heavy with a much larger amount of fluid than usual. With a touch, you wince as your fingers make contact with your nipples. The sensitivity is heightened, pulsing with an unfamiliar intensity. You quickly remove your armor and shirt, revealing your swollen chest that is visibly straining, droplets flowing freely down your torso, a river of life running down your body, pearlescent in the glow of the alien flames.

Bewilderment is quickly replaced by a sense of urgent realization - your lactation has increased exponentially. It's not just a trickle, it's a torrent, a spring that has been unexpectedly uncapped, flowing beyond the boundaries of what would be considered natural, even possible.

The usually docile tentacles at your feet seem to react to your sudden change, their undulations growing more frantic, their probing more audacious. Yet, amidst the strange serenade of these creatures and the pulsating rhythm of your own body, a ripple of laughter wells up within you. A spectacle it may be, it also brings a strange sense of exhilarating liberation.

Practical concerns begin to assert themselves. You will need to milk yourself more frequently now, possibly several times a day, a time-consuming and laborious task. But beyond the inconvenience, you find yourself intrigued.

A vision forms in your mind, of your journey punctuated by moments of intimate self-care, maintaining your body's new milk amidst your harsh expedition.
<<else>>\
Suddenly, you feel a strange sensation pulsating in your chest, a tingling that spreads like ripples on a pond's surface. An odd warmth infuses your body, from your torso, radiating outward, sharp as a bolt of lightning yet as gentle as a lover's caress. It feels like a dam has broken within you, and you watch, fascinated and alarmed, as two damp circles start to spread on the front of your shirt.

You lift your shirt and feel your breath catch in your throat at the sight of your nipples. They look almost the same but are leaking a clear fluid, tiny droplets glistening in the flickering light of the exotic fires around you. A fingertip experimentally swipes across one, the sensation foreign but not entirely unpleasant. Tasting the droplet, you find it sweet, and you realize - you are lactating. You can't help but smirk, a low chuckle bubbling up from your chest at the absurdity of the situation.

The squirming tentacles around you brush against your sensitized skin as you stand in stunned silence, processing this unexpected development. A gurgling burble of laughter escapes you, a bright spark of amusement amidst the surreal fiery landscape. You imagine yourself, this battle-hardened adventurer, taking breaks to milk yourself amidst the battles, the treasure hunts, the desperate survival in this hellish Abyss.

Beneath you, the tentacles wriggle and writhe, their rhythm echoing your heart's erratic beats. The heat, the smoke, the ever-regenerating tendrils of the Abyss, the almost hypnotic movements of the flames, and now, the strange, sweet warmth of your own body, everything adds to the sensual overload.

With the intoxicating scent of burning flesh in your nostrils, the heat bearing down on your skin, and the ever-present touch of the tentacles caressing you, you feel a sudden shift in the fabric of reality around you. It is as if some unseen hand has taken hold of the strings of your existence and twisted them into a new configuration.

You pause, momentarily frozen in your journey through the Abyss, as you consider the meaning of this new affliction. It's not pain, but rather a change, a loss that makes your heart hammer in your chest and a breathless dread fill you. Your climaxes, once a shared peak of pleasure, can no longer be gifted or received from any other. The culmination of desire and intimacy will be a solitary endeavor, your pleasure forever an island amid a sea of possible lovers. Your mind reels at the prospect, a dark echo of fear and loneliness amplifying the cruel heat of the Abyss.

A tentacle brushes against your thigh, curling around the skin. Its touch is as tantalizing as ever, but now, it feels different. There is an awareness of what you've lost, of the boundary that has been drawn around you.

As you continue your hoke through the hellish fields of tentacles, you pause to catch your breath, leaning against a heated rock that's worn smooth by the relentless press of the undulating tentacles. Suddenly, you feel a prickling sensation at the base of your spine. It's like a shiver, the kind that tingles down your spine when you find something excitingly forbidden, but more concentrated, more tangible.

Before you can even contemplate the sensation, a sudden burst of energy radiates from the spot, spreading outward in waves that crash through your being, causing your heart to pound and your breath to hitch. With a strange mix of shock and curiosity, you reach down, your fingertips brushing against something sinewy and sleek that hadn't been there before.

Your mind reels as you realize what's happened. A tail. A spade-tipped tail of your own, prehensile and unnaturally sensitive. Its silky surface is inky black, contrasting your $mc.skinColor skin, and ending with a cute, spade-shaped tip that catches the fiery lights of the Abyss, shimmering under the dancing flames. It curves gracefully behind you, swishing lightly in the smoky air as if testing its own existence.

A breathless laugh escapes your lips, a strange euphoria creeping through your veins as you marvel at the absurdity and yet enticing prospect of this sudden change. You run your fingers down its length, the sensation shooting straight up your spine and spreading warmth all over your body. Your new tail twitches under your touch, responding independently, as though it has a mind of its own.

As you continue to explore your Abyss-altered self, you can't help but wonder about the experiences that await you. This newfound appendage, this erogenous zone that you've been Cursed with, is sure to bring some interesting developments to your journey. Your mind wanders to the ways this tail could be used, the pleasure it could bring you and possibly others, guided by your subconscious desires.

You turn your attention back to the path ahead, a daunting yet enticing world of tentacles and hellish flames. As you trudge forward, your tail follows suit, curling and uncurling in the heated air.

	As the Leaky Curse takes hold of you, the effects are more subtle than you might have expected.
	
	There's no dramatic flash of arousal or some sudden change. In general, you just feel pretty good. However, over the next few minutes you gradually become aware that your loins are turning into one giant sticky swamp that's draining down your legs. A trickle of precum is oozing out of your penis and mixing with a steady dribbling coming out of your sopping vagina. 
	
	The mingling fluids spark a moment of concern; you haven't taken any Curses that would render you self-fertile, right?
	
	Regardless, you must find a solution to prevent leaving a trail that would not only annoy others but also make tracking you a breeze for predators in the Abyss. 
	
	If you ever happen to get aroused, would ultra-absorbent sanitary pads suffice for this deluge, or would you need to resort to diapers to hold back the flood of fluids? The prospect of living with this Curse just became much more challenging.
<<elseif $mc.penisCor > 0>>
	As the Leaky Curse takes hold of you, it's more subtle than you might have expected. 
	
	There's no dramatic flash of arousal or some sudden change. In general, you just feel pretty good. You shrug your shoulders and continue about your business for a bit, but about half and hour later you notice something. Your penis, your balls, and even your thighs have started getting sticky, and as you reach down to check out what's going on you realize they've all become slick with precum. 
	
	It's not a dramatic event, but a constant, minor flow of precum from the tip of your cock. It's so subtle that it would go unnoticed if not for the accumulating wetness. The continuous emission prevents it from drying, so you won't inadvertently adhere your penis to objects. However, managing this newfound predicament will be tricky. You're going to have to stop frequently to clean yourself up, or put something over your penis that you change frequently to catch the drips, or...
	
	The best thing for this might really be those sanitary pads women use for their periods. Barring that, some kind of diaper. Unless of course you just want to spend all your time soaked in sticky clothes or run around naked letting your penis drip on the ground.
<<elseif $mc.vagina>0>>
	As the Leaky Curse takes hold of you, it's more subtle than you might have expected.
	
	There's no dramatic flash of arousal or some sudden change. In general, you just feel pretty good. You continue about your business and then notice a small stream of sticky liquid slowly beginning to run down your leg. A sense of foreboding starts growing regarding the Curse you just obtained. You find a secluded place to check your crotch, but a quick observation reveals you are totally soaked with sexual fluids.
	
	After another five minutes and you realize you will need to do something about the trickle down your leg in case you ever get aroused for any reason. Maybe some combination of super absorbent sanitary pads would be sufficient to control this at a manageable level?
	
	If you don't want your vaginal juices dribbling down your legs whenever you get even slightly aroused, soaking whatever clothes you have, then you're going to have do do something drastic. Maybe even diapers would be required if the flow got too extreme and you were aroused for a long enough period of time.
<<else>>
	As the Leaky Curse takes hold of you, you don't notice anything different. Maybe that's not really surprising considering you don't have any genitals anymore the Curse can affect. Now that you're thinking about it, you seem to drool a little bit. Did the Curse affect your mouth because you don't have genitals? Or are you just drooling because you started thinking about genitals you no longer possess? It can be hard to tell, but your mouth definitely seems more moist than it used to be.

:: Take on Wandering Hands [layer6]
<<set _curse = new WanderingHands()>>\
<<set $mc.addCurse(_curse)>><<set $corruption += _curse.corr>>\
[img[setup.ImagePath + _curse.pic]]

Suddenly, there is a jolt, a strange, metaphysical thump that echoes deep within your being. The world around you remains unchanged, yet something within you has shifted dramatically.

You pause, stumbling slightly as a wave of nausea washes over you. Your heart pounds within your chest, its rhythmic thumping echoing in your ears. Taking a deep breath, you try to steady yourself, yet find your fingers have begun tracing absent patterns against your skin.

Your touch ignites a series of sensations that are both alien and familiar. Your fingers, moving with a will of their own, slide across your chest, finding the sensitive hollows and peaks there. You gasp as your thumb flicks over a hardened nipple, the small nub sensitive and tingling with a strange, needy pulse.

You freeze as you realize what is happening, your gaze drawn down to where your own hand is groping your body with lustful intent. A wave of confusion and horror washes over you, your mind reeling with the implications of this new, uncontrollable desire.

But even as you pull your hand away, the heat of your own touch lingers, spreading out from your chest and coiling in your stomach. You swallow hard, your thoughts racing as you try to comprehend the scope of the Curse.

The implications are staggering. How will you maintain control when every absent-minded moment might lead to moments of sexual self-fulfillment? Will you be able to keep this secret hidden from your companions, or will they see you, flushed and panting, as your own body seeks its pleasure? And what of your sleep, where your subconscious mind holds sway, and your waking inhibitions hold no power?

The answers are far from comforting, leaving you to face a future filled with uncertainty and strange, voyeuristic desire.

Returning to the fragrant desert of the previous layer will take 15 days of trekking, and cost 65 corruption.

You see yourself wading through a slimy field of slithering tentacles, with a deep heat and the smell of sulfur washing over you as you view the hell you are observing. Suddenly the image shifts and you see the splendor of the Relics that are available on this layer.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 7-relics.png']]

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and Curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threats that await you on the layer.

Finally, the vision fades, leaving you standing once again where you were before, with only a brief sense of motion sickness as you orient yourself back to your physical body. As you look at the Gleam Dazer once again, you notice the Relic is cracked and broken.

As you wade through the navel-high thicket of tentacles, the heat and humidity intensifying with each step, the scent of savory smoke fills your nostrils. A bead of sweat drips down your forehead and you wipe it away, your senses heightened in this infernal environment.<br><br>

Suddenly, the ground beneath you shudders, and a sense of impending doom washes over you. The wriggling carpet of tentacles you've been traversing parts to reveal a colossal creature, the greater tentacle beast. Its gargantuan mass of sinewy tendrils undulates and writhes, pulsating with a lustful hunger that sends a shiver down your back.

The greater tentacle beast doesn't immediately surround you, but rather, it seems to study you from a distance, its countless tendrils weaving and swaying with an eerie grace. The slick surface of the tendrils glisten in the flickering light, their vibrant colors even more vivid than before. Your pulse quickens, adrenaline flooding your veins as you struggle to comprehend the enormity of the creature before you.

As the beast's tendrils slowly begin to reach towards you, you realize that this is your opportunity to strike. You know that guns and amateur swordplay are of little use against the greater tentacle beast, but your resolve hardens. With a primal scream, you gather your strength and prepare to fight the beast, desperate to avoid its lustful grip.

	In a flash, the greater tentacle beast lunges toward you, its countless tendrils erupting from the ground and surrounding you in a suffocating embrace. The slick, sinewy tendrils coil around your limbs, binding you tightly as they explore every inch of your body with perverse curiosity. Their touch is deceptively gentle, yet insistent, sending shivers down your spine as they delicately caress your $mc.breastsLabel cup breasts, teasing your nipples, and exploring the soft flesh of your inner thighs.

	As the numbing liquid seeps into your flesh, your resistance begins to crumble. Your body, betraying your will, succumbs to the overwhelming sensations flooding your senses. The tendrils, now firmly in control, probe deeper, invading the most private depths of your womanhood with a skillful precision that leaves you gasping for air. Some tendrils continue to play with your breasts, kneading them and tugging gently on your nipples, while others slither their way into your most intimate crevices.

	The relentless invasion of the tendrils sends wave after wave of pleasure coursing through your body, a dizzying blend of ecstasy and agony that threatens to shatter your sanity. The beast's tendrils fill your every orifice, pulsating and writhing with an insatiable hunger that you cannot deny. The heat of the surrounding flames only serves to intensify the experience, their exotic colors casting a sensual glow on your entwined bodies, highlighting the tantalizing curve of your hips and the shape of your $mc.breastsLabel cup breasts.

	As you lose yourself in the depths of pleasure, a part of you knows that you've surrendered to the greater tentacle beast. The thought of being left immobile for $tentacleFucked days in this hellish environment is a distant concern, dwarfed by the relentless torrent of ecstasy that threatens to drown you. But in this moment, with your body and mind utterly consumed by the beast's advances, there is no room for fear or regret.

	As the greater tentacle beast's relentless assault on your senses continues, the line between pleasure and pain begins to blur. Your body trembles with each new wave of ecstasy, your muscles straining against the slick tendrils that hold you captive. The scent of the savory smoke and the heat of the exotic flames have become a distant backdrop, overshadowed by the all-consuming sensations that the beast elicits within you.

	Gradually, the intensity of the experience begins to ebb. The tendrils, which had been pulsating and writhing with such fervor, start to slow their movements, becoming more languid and deliberate. The numbing liquid that had dulled your pain receptors starts to dissipate, and the once-overwhelming sensations are replaced by a gentle, soothing caress. The tendrils withdraw from your intimate areas, leaving a tingling warmth in their wake.

	You can feel the greater tentacle beast's grip on your body loosening, its tendrils untangling and retreating one by one. As each tendril releases you, a cool sensation washes over your exposed skin, a stark contrast to the sweltering heat that surrounds you. The exotic flames seem to dim, their hypnotic hues fading to a mere flicker as you are gradually released from the beast's embrace.

	As the last of the tendrils slips away, you collapse to the ground, your body a trembling, sweat-slicked mass of spent nerves and exhausted muscles. You draw in deep, ragged breaths, your lungs aching for the oxygen they had been so cruelly denied. The once-overpowering scent of smoke now serves as a grounding reminder of your surroundings, a faint anchor to reality amidst the chaos of your recent ordeal.

	Despite the lingering exhaustion, a sense of relief and freedom washes over you as you realize that the greater tentacle beast has released you. The taste of survival is bittersweet, a complex mixture of gratitude, fear, and the lingering remnants of pleasure that still cling to your nerve endings. You know that the coming $tentacleFucked days will be a challenge, your body weakened and vulnerable, but you are determined to press onward.

	In a flash, the greater tentacle beast lunges toward your party. Khemia leaps into action, his sword slicing through the air with precision and power. The beast's tendrils reach out hungrily, but Khemia's swift movements keep them at bay. He weaves and dodges, his blade severing tendrils with each graceful swing.

	Despite Khemia's skill and strength, the sheer number of tendrils proves to be a challenge. A rogue tendril manages to slip past his defenses, coiling around his leg and yanking him off balance. Khemia grits his teeth in pain as the tendril tightens its grip, leaving deep, dark bruises on his tanned skin.

	With a determined roar, Khemia slashes at the offending tendril, severing it from the beast's massive form. The creature recoils, releasing Khemia and retreating into the depths of the Abyss. The severed tendrils around him twitch and wither, their fleshy colors fading to a dull, lifeless gray.

	You and your party members rush to Khemia's side, helping him to his feet. His injuries are painful but not life-threatening. Together, you continue your journey through the Abyss, ready to move on from this dangerous place.

:: Layer6 Dragon Encounter [layer6 nobr]

As you wade through the navel-high tentacles, your senses are assaulted by the heat and the suffocating smell of smoke. The once-solid path is replaced by a squirming, undulating carpet of tendrils, some alight with exotic-colored flames that gently caress your skin. Amidst the infernal landscape, you suddenly catch sight of a large, imposing figure: the fell dragon.


:: Layer6 Threat2 [layer6]
<<set $timeL6T2 -= 8>>
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/felldragon.png']]

The dragon's immense presence is nearly tangible, and the air seems to crackle with tension. You stand transfixed as the fell dragon unfurls its wings, casting sinister shadows upon the scorched earth. Its eyes lock onto yours, and you feel the weight of its ancient, malevolent intelligence bearing down on you. The dragon's breath hisses as it exhales, and you taste the acrid tang of sulfur and ozone, sharp against your tongue.

With a heart-pounding realization, you remember the hoard of dubloons you carry. The fell dragon senses your wealth, and its eyes narrow with greed. You know that the creature will not rest until it has claimed your gold for its own, and you must make a choice: appease its wrath with a hefty offering, fight the monstrous beast, or flee and risk the searing pain of its flames.

As the dragon's maw opens, revealing a churning, swirling vortex of multicolored fire, you steel yourself for the decision that could determine your fate in this unforgiving layer of the Abyss.
