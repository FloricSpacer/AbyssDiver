!Layer 6 - Cinders of Dis
@@The first hint of the sixth layer is a strong smell of smoke overwhelming your nostrils - a savory, meaty kind of smoke, almost like the smell of barbeque. It almost feels like the flowers beneath you are caressing your feet, but the air gets hotter and hotter as you head further down, and as the flowers begin to become charred and burned awar, the real culprit becomes clear: a squirming carpet of tentacles, thousands or millions of tiny villi completely covering almost every surface on the path ahead, forming an entire field of squirming creatures.

They grow taller as you proceed, until you're wading through a thicket or navel-high tentacles, prodding and rubbing against your most sensitive areas. By this point, the heat has become truly intense, almost sauna-like. It's so hot that great swathes of the tentacle fields are actually aflame, thousands of tendrils being birned away and perpetually springing up again, a land of flesh doused in fire: a perfect vision of Hell. Some of the fire are in a familiar orange-red hue, while other come in more exotic greens, pinks, and purples, only lightly tickling when they lap at your skin. Small pieces of rubble, perhaps of some ancient structures, litter the layer...but the tentacles and flames have long since crushed and burned them into unrecognizable, meaningless rock.

	You put on the self-cooling clothes. The romer stones that you incorperated in it feel like small airconditioning units although the clothes are light they still cover you very well and soon you feel them cool your entire body. You feel like you could run a mile in these clothes and still not overheat in this hellish landscape you find yourself. It looks like you'll be able to cover more distance wearing this than you would normally be able to, reducing all travel costs on this layer by 1 day.<br><br>

<<elseif $dollevent2 && $coolCloth>>

	By now you have accepted that you can't take of the tattered pink dress. But when you try to put the self-cooling clothes over your tattered dress you faint, only to wake up with the summer clothes off and neatly folded in your hands again. Looking at the doll you swear you can see it grinning at you. It seems you are stuck sweating it out in this worn down dress. If only it would be little hoter so that acursed doll would go up in flames..<br><br>

<<elseif $dollevent2 && !$coolCloth>>
	Dressed in only your tattered pink dress you feel very exposed to the heat on this layer. You whish you had something cooler and more insulating to wear to protect you.

A thunderous roar disturbs you as your tread across the slimy, tentacled-ground of the sixth layer. At first you don't see the source of the sound, but after a moment you look up and see an enormous Fell Dragon approaching with great speed. It lets out a stream of fire as a warning before roaring again and landing in front of you with it's head held high and a subtle stream of liquid fire dribbling from the corner of its mouth. It is demanding tribute for you carrying your wealth in these lands, and now is your chance to pay it.<br><br>

In an incredible collaboration with colleagues on the surface, Saeko managed to develop some incredibly innovative water filtration techniques. The water purified from the River Dycx using this technique is absolutely safe to drink, and it even has a pleasant, slightly sweet, cinnamon flavor to it. If this were more easily accessible maybe you could sell this as a unique drink to people on the surface.

There is a very easily accessible source of water on this layer, the River Dycx, which is bright red and leaves a cinnamon-like aftertaste in your mouth. Unfortunately it also leaves a bit of a burning hole in your heart, causing you to gain an additional jinxed flame counter for each day of water you drink here, making it even more unpleasant to leave. Watch out for how much water you drink here or you may find yourself never able to leave.

	As the Leaky curse takes hold of you, it's more subtle than you might have expected.
	There's no dramatic flash of arousal or some large change. In general, you just feel pretty good. However, over the next few minutes you gradually become aware that your loins are turning into one giant sticky swamp that's draining down your legs. A trickle of precum is oozing out of your penis and mixing with a steady dribbling coming out of your sopping vagina. 
	It slowly dawns on you that when the curse said you'd be leaking, it didn't mean a little bit, and it didn't mean only sometimes. The sheer magnitude of sexual fluids mixing around your crotch and flowing down your lower body, coating everything in sticky solution is actually pretty daunting. 
	The fact that the fluids are mixing around your crotch leaves you with a flash of concern; you haven't taken any curses that would make you self-fertile, have you? Regardless, what are you going to do about this? Just walk around letting your juices dribble onto the ground, filling your shoes? You're pretty sure that leaving such a trail behind you would irritate a lot of people, and down here in the abyss it would certainly make tracking you an easy task for any predators. 
	Would some super-absorbant sanitary pads do the trick for this deluge? Do you need to start wearing diapers to keep this tide of juices back? The prospects of living with this curse just got a lot more daunting
<<elseif $app.penisCor > 0>>
	As the Leaky curse takes hold of you, it's more subtle than you might have expected. 
	There's no dramatic flash of arousal or some large change. In general, you just feel pretty good. You shrug your shoulders and continue about your business for a bit, but about half and hour later you notice something. Your penis, your balls, and even your thighs have started getting sticky, and as you reach down to check out what's going on you realize they've all become slick with precum. 
	It's not some dramatic event, there's now just a constant small flow of precum out of the tip of your cock. It's so small that you wouldn't even notice it except for the accumulation. The constant emission doesn't let it dry out, so you're not going to be glueing the tip of your penis to things through the stickiness, but wow, this is going to be tricky to manage. You're going to have to start stopping very frequently to clean yourself up, or put some kind of condom over your penis that you change frequently to catch the drips, or ... your heart is in your stomach. 
	The best thing for this might really be those sanitary pads women use for their periods. Barring that, some kind of diaper. Unless of course you just want to spend all your time in soaked sticky clothes or run around naked letting your penis drip on the ground.
<<elseif $app.vagina>0>>
	As the Leaky curse takes hold of you, it's more subtle than you might have expected.
	There's no dramatic flash of arousal or some large change. In general, you just feel pretty good. You continue about your business and then notice a small stream of sticky liquid slowly running down your leg. You'd put a tampon in this morning, so you're surprised, but a sense of foreboding starts growing in your about the curse you just took. You find a secluded place to replace your tampon, but as you pull out the old one it's totally soaked with sexual fluids, and the new one is expanding rapidly even as you try to put it in. Your trepidation redoubles.
	After another five minutes the new tampon has apparently soaked through as well and the trickle down your leg resumes. This is no good. No good at all. Is some combination of tampons and super absorbant sanitary pads going to be sufficient to control this at a manageable level?
	If you don't want your vaginal juices dribbling down your legs at all times, soaking whatever clothes you have, filling up your shoes, then you're going to have do do something drastic. Maybe even diapers would be required for a flow this persistent. The thought of needing to get diapers changed twice a day to deal with the sexual fluids that gradually would fill up the padding and swaddle you in your own (admittedly now fantastic smelling) arousal causes a notable increase in the rate of flow coming out of your vagina. Oh wow, this curse is more than you bargained for.
<<else>>
	As the Leaky curse takes hold of you, you don't notice anything different. Maybe that's not really surprising considering you don't have any genitals anymore the curse can affect. Now that you're thinking about it, you seem to drool a little bit. Did the curse affect your mouth because you don't have genitals? Or are you just drooling because you started thinking about genitals you no longer posses?

While the Fell Dragons are immune to most conventional methods of attack, you can combine the power of the Toral Wave with the Empath Coil to electrocute the dragon. A single touch can stun the dragon, allowing follow-up attacks that can take it down. This method is only likely to work once, but it can effective. Even this method isn't safe though, leaving you with minor injuries that will increase your next 3 travel times by 2 days each.<br>

You can appease the dragon by offering it 100 dubloons. It would graciously allow you to live and keep the rest of your hoard if you want, though keep in mind another one might come your way if you're still holding enough to attract them in 8 days.<br>
	[[Offer 100 dubloons to appease the dragon|Layer6 Ascend2][$dubloons -= 100]]<br><br>
If you try to run away without fighting to keep your dubloons safe, prepare to be severely burned before you manage to get away. This will increase all travel times by 4 days until you can get it healed and it will take 2 medkits to heal it!<br>

	You can take it down effectively with a gun, but you'll need at least 19 bullets to take it down due its amorphous form and enormous size. But even despite those limitations, a ranged weapon like a gun is probably the safest way to take one of these down.<br>

[[Defeat it with the Brave Vector|Layer6 Ascend2]]<br><br>

If you allow it to overpower you, you will be completely ravaged by the enormous beast. This will be incredibly pleasurable at the time, with powerful numbing agents making sure you don't feel any pain during the process, and only feel the pleasure. But after it's over, you'll be in a sorry state, being left completely incapacitated for a full 12 days unless you use a medkit.

	You continue through the playfully ticklish yet hellishly searing tentacles for a long hike downward. You find some small hints of paved paths that have long since degraded, but no other indication of what is next for you, until suddenly you are faced with a metal barricade, signaling the end of the sixth layer and the start of the seventh.

How do you want to deal with the awe-inspiring dragon flying above your head?


<<nobr>>
<<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Sunbeam") && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Khemia") && $khemiaDragon == 1>>
The dragon takes care to avoid Khemia at close range, so he won't have a chance to use Sunbeam this time, at least not if he wants to make it out alive. <br><br>
<</if>>
<<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Sunbeam") && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Khemia") && $khemiaDragon == 0>>
	Khemia has enough expertise with a blade that if you give him the Sunbeam Relic he will be able to fight it off one time, but even he would be moderately burned by fighting it, increasing all travel times by 2 until you used a medkit on him. You will be able to get it's hoard of 50 dubloons when you kill it though.<br>
	[[Have Khemia fight it off with Sunbeam|Layer6 Exit2][$status.duration = 99, $status.penalty = 2, $khemiaDragon == 1, $dubloons += 50, $dragonKill += 1]]<br><br>
<</if>>
<<if $joyousSword == 1 && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Khemia") && $khemiaDragon == 0>>
	Khemia has enough expertise with a blade that if you give him the Joyous Sunder sword he will be able to defeat a dragon with only minor burns, increasing your next 3 travel times by 2 days each.<br>
	[[Have Khemia fight it off with Sunbeam|Layer6 Hub][$status.duration = 3, $status.penalty = 2, $khemiaDragon == 1, $dubloons += 50, $dragonKill += 1]]<br><br>
<</if>>
<<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Toral Wave") && $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Empath Coil") && $electricDragon == 0>>
While the Fell Dragons are immune to most conventional methods of attack, you can combine the power of the Toral Wave with the Empath Coil to electrocute the dragon. A single touch can stun the dragon, allowing follow-up attacks that can take it down. This method is only likely to work once, but it can effective. Even this method isn't safe though, leaving you with minor injuries that will increase your next 3 travel times by 2 days each.<br>
	[[Use your Relics to electrocute the dragon|Layer6 Hub][$status.duration = 3, $status.penalty = 2, $electricDragon == 1, $dubloons += 50, $dragonKill += 1]]<br><br>
<</if>>
You can appease the dragon by offering it 100 dubloons. It would graciously allow you to live and keep the rest of your hoard if you want, though keep in mind another one might come your way if you're still holding enough to attract them in 8 days.<br>
	[[Offer 100 dubloons to appease the dragon|Layer6 Exit2][$dubloons -= 100]]<br><br>
If you try to run away without fighting to keep your dubloons safe, prepare to be severely burned before you manage to get away. This will increase all travel times by 4 days until you can get it healed and it will take 2 medkits to heal it!<br>
	[[Try to run and accept the consequences|Layer6 Exit2][$status.duration = 99, $status.penalty = 4, $dubloons += 50, $dragonBurn = 1]]<br><br>

Use the following option only if you have specifically considered your inventory and made a plan of how to use what you have to take down a dragon. You may only use each combination 1 time before the dragons learn from experience and overcome the weakness, making that strategy unusable a second time.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/greatertentaclebeast.png']]

As the enormous tentacle beast approaches, you must quickly decide on a course of action for defeating it, or fall into its slimy clutches and allow it to use you to sate its lust.

<<nobr>>
<<if $items[13].count > 0 && $items[20].count > 18>>
	You can take it down effectively with a gun, but you'll need at least 19 bullets to take it down due its amorphous form and enormous size. But even despite those limitations, a ranged weapon like a gun is probably the safest way to take one of these down.<br>
	[[Shoot it with your pistol|Layer6 Exit2][$items[20].count -= (19 - $bullRed)]]<br><br>
<</if>>
<<if $slingshot == 1>>
Your Brave Vector slingshot can be used like a gun, but it will take many shots to bring down the amorphous creature. Luckily ranged combat doesn't pose as much of a risk as melee against a great beast such as this one.<br>
[[Defeat it with the Brave Vector|Layer6 Exit2]]<br><br>
<</if>>
<<if $items[14].count > 0>>
Relying on your own swordplay will allow you to put up a minimum amount of resistance and tire it out a bit, leaving incapacitated for 10 days straight.<br>
	[[Fight it off with a sword|Layer6 Threat1 Descend2][$tentacleFucked = 10]]<br>
	<<if $items[4].count > 4>>[[Fight it off with a sword and use a medkit to cure the status|Layer6 Exit2][$items[4].count -= 1]]<br><</if>><br>
	<</if>>
<<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Sunbeam")>>
Using the power of Sunbeam to fight it yourself is better than using a sword, but only marginally so. It will leave you tentacle fucked for 9 days after the battle.<br>
	[[Fight it off with Sunbeam|Layer6 Threat1 Descend2][$tentacleFucked = 9]]<br>
	<<if $items[4].count > 4>>[[Fight it off with Sunbeam and use a medkit to cure the status|Layer6 Exit2][$items[4].count -= 1]]<br><</if>><br>
	<</if>>
<<if $items[14].count > 0 && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Khemia")>>
	Khemia has enough expertise with a blade to be able to fight it off, but even he wouldn't be able to get away safely, becoming immobilized for 2 days if you let him fight for you with a sword.<br>
	[[Have Khemia fight it off with a sword|Layer6 Threat1 Descend2][$tentacleFucked = 2, $khemiaFucked = 1]]<br>

	<</if>>
<<if $items[14].count > 0 && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Khemia")>>
	If you equip Khemia with Sunbeam, he'll be more effective, but even then he'd be left incapacitated from the various numbing agents for a full day.<br>
	[[Have Khemia fight it off with Sunbeam|Layer6 Threat1 Descend2][$tentacleFucked = 1, $khemiaFucked = 1]]<br>

<</if>>
<<if $joyousSword == 1 && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Khemia")>>
	If you equip Khemia with the Joyous Sunder, he'll be much more effective, to the point that he'd be able to defeat the beast without sustaining any major injuries himself, an impressive feat even for someone like him.<br>
	[[Have Khemia fight it off with Joyous Sunder|Layer6 Exit2]]<br><br>
<</if>>
If you allow it to overpower you, you will be completely ravaged by the enormous beast. This will be incredibly pleasurable at the time, with powerful numbing agents making sure you don't feel any pain during the process, and only feel the pleasure. But after it's over, you'll be in a sorry state, being left completely incapacitated for a full 12 days unless you use a medkit. This is especially dangerous since it leaves you only a few days left until your next encounter with one of the beasts.<br>

An intense, yet somehow comforting, warmth radiates from the Creepy Doll. You sense that it is a deep and powerful energy, but somehow, other descriptions of it elude you.<br><br>

	Khemia is not in a good state after the battle, even with his experience, he obviously wasn't ready to deal with a fully grown tentacle beast on his own. He dealt a lot of damage, but he's still incapacitated. Despite some claims of his that you can keep going, it's impossible to move on with him in this state, so you need to make camp and stay with him until he's recovered.

You wait as your balloon rapidly ascends and you can watch the infernal fields of tentacles gently ungulating below and around you. A far cry from having to tread through them, you can take a moment to breathe in the subtle smell of sulfur wafting up to you, even as you float through the layer.

As you bring the charm up to your eye and gaze deep into the red crystal, your vision fades and a new image comes clearly into view:

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Layer Intros/l6intro.png']]

@@.layerTitle;LAYER 6 - CINDERS OF DIS@@

You see yourself wading through a slimey field of slithering tentacles, with a deep heat and the smell of sulfur washing over you as you view the hell you are observing. Suddenly the image shifts and you see the splendor of the Relics that are available on this layer.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 7-relics.png']]

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 7-wonders.png']]

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and Curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 7-curses.png']]

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threaths that await you on the layer

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 7-threats.png']]

Finally, the vision fades, leaving you standing once again where you were before, with only a brief sense of motion sickness as you orient yourself back to your physical body. As you look at the Gleam Dazer once again, you notice the Relic is cracked and broken.
