@@.layerTitle;LAYER 6 - CINDERS OF DIS@@

The first hint of the sixth layer is a strong smell of smoke overwhelming your nostrils - a savory, meaty kind of smoke, almost like the smell of barbeque. It almost feels like the flowers beneath you are caressing your feet, but the air gets hotter and hotter as you head further down, and as the flowers begin to become charred and burned awar, the real culprit becomes clear: a squirming carpet of tentacles, thousands or millions of tiny villi completely covering almost every surface on the path ahead, forming an entire field of squirming creatures.

They grow taller as you proceed, until you're wading through a thicket or navel-high tentacles, prodding and rubbing against your most sensitive areas. By this point, the heat has become truly intense, almost sauna-like. It's so hot that great swathes of the tentacle fields are actually aflame, thousands of tendrils being birned away and perpetually springing up again, a land of flesh doused in fire: a perfect vision of Hell. Some of the fire are in a familiar orange-red hue, while other come in more exotic greens, pinks, and purples, only lightly tickling when they lap at your skin. Small pieces of rubble, perhaps of some ancient structures, litter the layer...but the tentacles and flames have long since crushed and burned them into unrecognizable, meaningless rock.

A thunderous roar disturbs you as your tread across the slimy, tentacled-ground of the sixth layer. At first you don't see the source of the sound, but after a moment you look up and see an enormous Fell Dragon approaching with great speed. It lets out a stream of fire as a warning before roaring again and landing in front of you with it's head held high and a subtle stream of liquid fire dribbling from the corner of its mouth. It is demanding tribute for you carrying your wealth in these lands, and now is your chance to pay it.

Your walk across the sixth layer continues as normal, and you bat away some harassing tentacles, but something was different about these?

They push against you more persistantly than normal, but as you resist thr ground itself buckles and shifts. Barely managing to leap away in time, it seems that you've stumbled across a fully grown Greater Tentacle Beast!

Suddenly, you are struck with a splitting headache, in an almost literal sense as you can almost feel your skull splitting apart. Luckily, you aren't dying, but a shape is emerging from your skull, and it seems to be a demonic-looking horn. The pain subsides as you feel the horn pushing out of your head, but sensations on the horn still feel tender, as if it were an especially sensitive part of your body.

Naturally, you reach up to touch your new addition and confirm that indeed it is hard, made of some bone-like material, but it is also quite sensitive. You can feel even the most tender touch when you caress the horn and perhaps it might even be pleasurable to touch in a certain way? This might be a part of your body you'll have to experiment with later, when you have some free time.
