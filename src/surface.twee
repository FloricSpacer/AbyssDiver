Hey, you're here to explore the Abyss, right? I'm sure you are; just about everyone who visits Outset Town dives down to explore it sooner or later. Our town is built around the outer edge of the Abyss, an enormous hole in the earth. Nobody can even begin to guess how deep it is. It goes at least several kilometers down, but nobody is known to have ever reached the bottom or even gotten close, so it could be much deeper. Of course, the biggest draw bringing so many explorers to challenge its depths is the Relics, mysterious tools with abilities that can't be explained by modern science. Many of these Relics have extremely useful or powerful magical effects, so while the risk is great, it can be well worth the effort for all the divers who venture into the Abyss after them.


While traveling down into the pit is fraught with danger in the form of beasts, traps, and unforgiving environments, it's getting back up to the surface that usually poses the greatest problem. A near- omnipresent Miasma pervades the Abyss, getting thicker and more potent the further down you go, and being especially concentrated around ancient and powerful Relics. Ascending to the surface through the layers of Miasma leads to divers being afflicted with Curses, transformative effects that can slowly change or corrupt the body and mind. Although repeated ascents from the same layer can become marginally easier due to a minor acclimation effect, the toll on body and spirit remains significant, as one can never truly adapt to the otherworldly nature of the Abyss. The more you explore the Abyss, the deeper you trek, the more Relics you take... the more the person you were before slips away. Some divers are completely unrecognizable when they emerge, and more than a few don't emerge at all, defeated by the Abyss, consumed by greed, fearful of the effects of ascent, or sometimes simply discovering that they prefer life down there.

Because Curses can often have substantial effects on the minds and behavior of divers, there are very few accurate reports and little information available about the Abyss past the first couple of layers. Most of it is an unknown, unexplored frontier. Just remember to make sure you can live with the decisions you make down there. Divers that have surfaced from particularly deep dives with many Curses generally seem happy with their life, but frequently have troubles reintegrating into society on account of the changes in their appearance and behavior. There's nothing wrong with deciding you've hit your limit and choosing to end your adventure early... just be sure that you make that decision while you're still you.

Come with me, and I'll give you some dubloons to help you buy some supplies!

<<set $dubloons = 300>>
<img @src="setup.ImagePath+'icon.png'" class="floatr">\
If you're going to be spending days, weeks, or months adventuring in a dangerous, monster-filled pit, you need to get some supplies first! Here's your stipend of 300 dubloons to get you started. We'll also supply you with a very large and a durable rucksack that should be big enough for just about anything you'll need to carry on your journey. It doubles as a thermal sleeping bag, too!

You can find valuable Relics while you're down in the Abyss, and if you like, you can sell them here and obtain additional dubloons to fund your expedition. This does require you to go through the Miasma multiple times and become more corrupted, so weigh your options carefully first. Relics change hands quickly after being sold, so you probably won't be able to get them back later if you get seller's remorse. Unless you found someone with enough connections to get them back, they're gone for good.

Apart from the things you buy here and the clothes on your back, we can't let you bring anything else into the Abyss. Most tools made from outside materials quickly decay and become useless when brought into the Abyss, anyways.

However, the most important way to spend your dubloons is to hire companions for your journey. They can bring unique abilities and expertise that are essential to any successful expedition. Once you meet someone around Outset Town you want to hire, you can head to the companion area and pick up their contract for the agreed price.

<<set $totalCarry = parseInt($carryWeight)>><<set $carryWeight = parseInt($carryWeight)>>
<img @src="setup.ImagePath+'icon.png'" class="floatr">\
Now there's only a little more to tell you before you can spend those free 300 dubloons we're giving you! This is the habitation option for our current layer, which is the Surface.

You'll find Habitation options just like this one on every layer of the Abyss. These represent possible endings to your journey, giving you an idea of what happens after you decide to settle down. You might end up choosing one of the options down in the Abyss due to finding that you don't have enough supplies to make it back to the surface, or because you don't want to take on more Curses to be able to ascend through the Miasma - or perhaps you'll simply fall in love with one of the layers down there and never want to leave. It happens sometimes, but not very often in the deeper layers.

After picking a Habitation option, your fate will be locked, sealing you permanently in the layer you choose and foiling future attempts to change your mind and leave. This also applies if you spend over <b>two consecutive days </b>on the surface after having previously been down in the Abyss - the Miasma will adapt and grow to reject your body, preventing you from entering the Abyss once more and forcing you into the surface's Habitation option. Furthermore, Habitation options are all locked away by fate until you choose them - you can't actually interact with any Habitation options or potentially make use of them on your quest prior to choosing them and settling down. <i>You cannot choose a Habitation option when your corruption points are lower than 0.</i>

What your companions do after you pick a Habitation option will largely depend on their temperament, and how well you've treated them on your adventure. Did you woo them and steal their heart, making them want to spend the rest of their days with you? Or did you merely treat them as tools, exploiting them for gain? Some companions, like Cloud, have a vested interest in the surface and would need a great deal more convincing to stay down in the Abyss permanently... while, for example, Cherry would be bit of a challenge to convince to live anywhere, let alone return to her life on the surface. Keep things like that in mind when thinking about how your ending will go. If necessary, companions may attempt to return to the surface on their own if you decide to stay down there. The return trip is less perilous for them than it is for you, after all.

Now I think you can have a look around the town and choose how to spend your dubloons!

As you walk around town, you notice a woman with hot pink hair and enormous breasts trying to haggle the price of a Relic up. She holds a relatively mundane cup up towards the merchant in apparent exasperation, but he seems unfazed and simply shrugs his shoulders. After a moment of waiting, she sighs and hands him the cup, receiving a small amount of dubloons in return, seemingly unsuccessful in her bargaining attempt.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 2>>
As you make your way to your destination, you notice an especially burly man with a fluffy dog tail behind him and floppy dog ears on top of his head crying quite loudly by the side of the street. He seems to be hugging a more average-looking man, who in turn seems to be trying to comfort him. The large dog-man gestures to his crotch (where you notice a sizable bulge), and the smaller man winces, but hugs him tighter attempting to reassure him once again before they walk into the local inn together, holding hands.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 3>>
Near the entrance to the Abyss, you notice a woman offering something to divers who are about to venture downwards. Taking a closer look, you can see that she's offering basic supplies with fancy labels at a significant markup from the shop prices! You can get "Abyss-proven" water or "Miasma-resistant" food for double the cost. And while most divers seem to be ignoring her, a few hesitate to hear her sales pitch and a few more of those end up buying the overpriced supplies.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 4>>
An apparently quite young boy, seemingly barely even a teenager, seems to be getting into a fight with a very scantily-clad woman in front of a non-descript building with a few similarly-dressed women inside watching. At first the words are indistinct, but then the boy gets louder as he tries to offer money and is refused for obvious reasons. He tries to give some justification and offer the money again, but the woman calls a large man in an imposing security uniform who escorts him away from the premises. The boy complains, but ultimately walks away disappointed.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 5>>
A quiet black-haired young woman, who you seem to remember from the companion area, seems to be sitting on a bench in the middle of town with a notebook in her lap. She seems to be writing vigorously whenever an abnormal looking person walk by, but becomes still when no one atypical is in sight. When she notices you looking at her, she meets your eyes for a moment, but then goes back to her previous behavior of intermittent rapid scrawls when someone interesting happens by the town center.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 6>>
As you walk through town, you spot a gentle-looking young man with ruffled brown hair and striking green eyes trading some standard items to a pair of prospective divers. As he finishes the transaction he glances over at you and his eyes widen for a split second, but then he returns to his neutral smiling face and continues on his way. Why did you bother to sit around and watch some random person in the background anyway? You've got to get back to your own adventure!<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 7>>
A large, hulking machine stands motionless near the entrance to the Abyss. You observe it for a few seconds, and spot some mechanisms of unknown purpose spinning and whirring around it. Curiously, it has a symbol resembling a baby spray painted onto its side, although you can't tell exactly what it's doing. Its attention seems entirely focused on the Abyss.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 8>>
A large, hulking machine stands motionless near the entrance to the Abyss.

:: Surface Companions Info [surface]

<img @src="setup.ImagePath+'icon.png'" class="floatr">\

You can hire some companions to come with you for your dive!

They're all heavily screened, loyal, and drawn to work here by a shared lust for adventure and discovery. They will obey any commands directly related to helping you explore the Abyss, but they'll generally put their safety first in times of extreme danger - they're partners, not slaves, and they may even choose to leave you if you treat them exceptionally poorly. There's nothing stopping you from trying to forge a deeper relationship with them if you like, though. I have it on good authority that you could have a chance with any of them romantically, regardless of gender. Or you could just make some lifelong friends!

They follow the same rules as you, so unless you buy supplies for them, they're going in with just the clothes on their backs and their rucksack sleeping bags. Also, all of them are injected with a lethal, dormant poison that activates on contact with human stomach acid, to prevent cannibalism. You'd be surprised by how much of an issue it used to be!

Also, you should probably know about The Purity Gene. The "purity gene" (scientifically, PUR69E) is a unique insertion mutation rarely observed in infants born near the Abyss, here in Outset Town. This mutation confers on its bearer an immunity to the effects of Miasma, preventing them from being corrupted during their ascent, or from being locked out of the Abyss after they leave it and spend a few days on the surface. Furthermore, it even allows their bodies to use Miasma as a source of nutrition and maintain many bodily functions, so they need no food or water while in the Abyss. Being so heavily connected with the Abyss has drawbacks, however - it confers on them problems completely opposite to those of normal divers. While they can ascend through the Abyss just fine, descending through the Abyss (even through early layers) quickly causes them to lose their memory and sense of self, and invariably causes them to abandon their life on the surface and live as a beast of the Abyss, in mind if not in body. This effect is prevented if a human without the "purity gene" accompanies them while they descend. A strong, impassable repelling force also prevents them from picking up Relics that haven't yet been claimed by another diver, so they can't split up to find Relics faster or bypass their corruption costs. As they require other divers to be with them to effectively explore the Abyss, the general consensus is that they are better suited as companions to other divers, rather than solo divers themselves - and those with the "purity gene" have been strictly prohibited from traveling into the Abyss alone.

In short: they're not corrupted by the Abyss, and don't need food or water, but are only effective and useful at exploring the Abyss when they're traveling with someone else who doesn't have the gene.

All of the companions available for hire here have the "purity gene."

Each companion has some initial abilities that will help you, but over time you can get to know them more and unlock more conversations, which will happen faster if you hit it off with them. Those can tell you more about the companion themselves and also unlock additional mechanical effects as they help you on your expedition!

You can hire companions here, but you'll need to meet them around town first. Once you've encountered a potential companion in Outset Town, you can come back to the hiring area to bring them on as part of your expedition.

:: Surface Summary [surface]
You stand at the edge of the Abyss, gazing into its unfathomable depths. The air is thick with anticipation and a hint of foreboding. As you contemplate your impending journey, you hear footsteps approaching from behind.

A young woman with long black hair, pale skin, and a thin frame walks up beside you. She's wearing a gray coat and red-rimmed glasses, which she adjusts as she looks out over the Abyss. Her posture is straight and professional, but there's a glimmer of excitement in her eyes as she surveys the scene.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Excuse me, but you look like you're preparing for a descent. I'm Saeko, a PhD student researching the Abyss. Mind if I give you some advice? It could mean the difference between life and death down there.<</say>>
She turns to face you, her expression serious but not unkind.

<<say $mc>>Sure, I'd appreciate any help I can get.<</say>>
Saeko nods, a small smile appearing on her face. She pulls out a small notebook and flips it open.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Excellent. First, let's talk about the four major things you need to keep track of down there.<</say>>
She points to various entries in her notebook as she explains.

<<say $companionSaeko>>There's <span class="sidebar-item">[img[setup.ImagePath+'Icons/corruption.png']]</span> <span style="color: #9370db;">corruption</span>, which you gain from Curses and spend obtaining Relics or when ascending layers. Then we have <span class="sidebar-item">[img[setup.ImagePath+'Icons/food.png']]</span> <span style="color: #ff8c00;">days of food</span> and <span class="sidebar-item">[img[setup.ImagePath+'Icons/water.png']]</span> <span style="color: #87ceeb;">days of water</span>. You'll consume one point of each daily, and trust me, you don't want to run out. Lastly, there are <span class="sidebar-item">[img[setup.ImagePath+'Icons/dubloons.png']]</span> <span style="color: #ffb833;">dubloons</span>, your currency down there and up here in Outset Town.<</say>>
Saeko pauses, looking at you to ensure you're following along. Her fingers tap lightly on the notebook as she continues.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Now, about weights. The Abyss isn't a place for overconfidence. You'll need to set your own limits, but be realistic. Breaking your back won't do you any favors.<</say>>
She closes her notebook and tucks it away, her gaze returning to the Abyss.

<<say $companionSaeko>>One crucial point: corruption is the only stat that can logically become negative. But be careful – if you make reckless choices, you might end up with a deficit you can't balance out. And remember, you can't return to the surface if your corruption is below zero.<</say>>
Saeko's voice takes on a slightly more personal tone as she adjusts her glasses again.

<<say $companionSaeko>>I should mention, this Abyss isn't exactly like the one you might have read about in certain works of fiction. You won't cry blood when ascending, which is a relief. But don't let that lull you into a false sense of security – death is still very much a possibility. And, well... let's just say sexual misadventures are more likely than you might expect.<</say>>
She clears her throat, a faint blush coloring her cheeks.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Anyway, you may have a guiding voice down there explaining your options. Think of it as your intuition, or perhaps the voice of the Abyss itself. Or both, if you prefer. It's something that some people who are very attuned to the Abyss tend to get.<</say>>
Saeko takes a deep breath, her posture relaxing slightly as she finishes her explanation.

<<say $companionSaeko>>That covers the basics. Oh, and if you're interested in more detailed assistance, you can hire me at the companion area for 170 dubloons. My research has given me some unique insights that could be valuable.<</say>>
She gives you a small, professional smile.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Any questions before you set off?<</say>>
You shake your head, feeling more prepared for the journey ahead.

<<say $mc>>No, I think I've got it. Thanks for the information, Saeko.<</say>>
Saeko nods, her expression a mix of seriousness and subtle encouragement.

<<say $companionSaeko>>Very well. Remember, knowledge is your best tool in the Abyss. Stay observant, stay cautious, and may your research yield fascinating results.<</say>>
With that, Saeko turns and walks away, leaving you to contemplate your impending descent into the Abyss.

/*[img[setup.ImagePath+'icon.png']]

Looks like you're ready to start your voyage! Let me just <span style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">summarize</span> and make some quick notes:

You have four major stats you should keep track of - <span class="sidebar-item">[img[setup.ImagePath+'Icons/corruption.png']]</span> <span style="color: #9370db;">corruption</span>, gained from Curses and spent obtaining Relics or whenever you ascend a layer, <span class="sidebar-item">[img[setup.ImagePath+'Icons/days.png']]</span> <span style="color: #ff8c00;">days of food</span> and <span class="sidebar-item">[img[setup.ImagePath+'Icons/water.png']]</span> <span style="color: #87ceeb;">days of water</span>, which you should be consuming 1 point each of daily or things will get really bad, and <span class="sidebar-item">[img[setup.ImagePath+'Icons/dubloons.png']]</span> <span style="color: #ffb833;">dubloons</span>, which you can spend on this page. (You can obtain more by surfacing with Relics and selling unwanted ones.) Weights are provided so that you don't break your back lifting completely unrealistic load, but you'll need to set your limits there. The only one that can logically become negative is corruption, but I'd use caution and try to keep it balanced when possible reckless choices may leave you with a deficit that you can't balance out, and you can't choose a Habitation option and end your adventure with corruption points lower than 0. Other than the free stipend of 300 dubloons that you got, all stats start at 0.

Though it heavily references it and shares a name with it, this isn't quite the same Abyss that you might be familiar with from certain work of fiction. You won't cry blood when ascending, and while death's certainly still possible, sexual misadventures are more likely. Prior knowledge of that Abyss and universe isn't necessary to enjoy this adventure at all.

You'll have my voice down there explaining your available options, but I won't be physically accompanying you. If you like, you can think of it as manifestation of your own intuition, or as the voice of the Abyss itself, or both.

:: Surface Exit [surface]
You stand at the foot of the Abyss, a hole large enough to defy the imagination. A light, cold wind tickles your face &mdash; not a familiar northerly wind, not a zephyr, not any kind of wind you've experienced before &mdash; no, this wind beckons you from below, from deep within the earth. The greedy maw of the Abyss patiently awaits your descent. The only way forward is downward.

Before you take your first step into the depths of the Abyss, be absolutely certain you are fully prepared. Check your equipment, review your skills, and steel your resolve. The challenges that await below are unlike anything you've faced before. This is your last chance to turn back and make any final preparations. The Abyss does not suffer the ill-prepared.

Maru fidgets with the hem of his dress, his blue eyes wide with a mix of excitement and nervousness. He takes a deep breath and looks up at you, a shy smile playing on his lips.

<<say $companionMaru>>Oh, wow! You... you really want me to come along? That's amazing! I promise I'll do my best to help out however I can. I may not be very strong, but I'll work hard! And, um, I hope you don't mind if I bring some of my sewing supplies? I could make us matching outfits for exploring! Or... or is that too silly? And maybe I won't have time...<</say>>
Maru's cheeks flush slightly, and he tucks a strand of blue hair behind his ear.

<<say $mc>>That sounds great, Maru. I'm looking forward to having you on the team.<</say>>
Maru's face lights up with joy, his previous nervousness melting away. He clasps his hands together excitedly.

She winks and flexes her arm, showing off her strength.

Lily beams at the compliment, then suddenly snaps her fingers as if remembering something important.

<<say $companionLily>>Oh! And don't forget, I'm a pro at haggling. Any Relics we find, I'll make sure we get top dollar for them. I'm all about adventure... and maybe a little profit on the side, right?<</say>>

<<say $companionKhemia>>Hell yeah! You won't regret this decision, I promise you that. The Abyss won't know what hit it when we're done exploring its depths. I've got a good feeling about this expedition – it's gonna be one for the history books!<</say>>

Cherry stands before you, her bright red hair contrasting sharply with her dull gray-green sweatshirt. Her posture is slouched, and her eyes seem to look past you, focusing on some distant point.

<<say $companionCherry>>I... I guess I'm on board then. Thanks for having me, I suppose. I'll try not to be a burden down there in the Abyss.<</say>>
She shifts her weight uncomfortably, her fingers fidgeting with the hem of her sweatshirt. There's a noticeable lack of enthusiasm in her voice, almost as if she's reciting a practiced line rather than expressing genuine sentiment.

<<say $mc>>I'm glad to have you on the team, Cherry. Your skills will be valuable, especially your medical knowledge.<</say>>
Cherry blinks slowly, her expression remaining unchanged. She gives a small, almost imperceptible nod.

<<say $companionCherry>>Right. The medical stuff. I can help with that. Just... don't expect too much from me, okay? I'm not exactly in top form these days.<</say>>
She looks down at her feet, her shoulders hunching slightly as if trying to make herself smaller.

<<say $mc>>I understand. We'll take it one step at a time. Is there anything you need before we prepare for the descent?<</say>>
Cherry raises her head, but her gaze still doesn't quite meet yours. There's a moment of hesitation before she speaks.

<<say $companionCherry>>No, I... I don't need much. Just point me to where I should put my stuff. And maybe... if you have any cat pictures, that'd be nice. Used to like those.<</say>>

<<say $companionCloud>>So, you've decided to take me on, huh? Smart choice. I've got a feeling we're going to make quite the team. Just remember, in the Abyss, it's not just about strength—it's about outsmarting the game itself. And trust me, I'm very good at games.<</say>>
He pushes off the wall, sauntering towards the player with an easy grace.

<<say $companionCloud>>Now, about that little financial arrangement I mentioned... Let's take a look at the fine print, shall we? I promise it won't bite — much.<</say>>

:: Cloud Contract 1 [surface]

Cloud produces a contract from seemingly nowhere, unfolding it with a flourish. His eyes sparkle with mischief and something deeper, more calculating.

<<say $companionCloud>>It's all quite simple, really. You get the funds you need, and in return, you just need to make sure we both come back in one piece. Oh, and pay it back on time, of course. Nothing to worry about if you're as capable as you seem.<</say>>
He offers the contract and a pen, his smile never wavering.

<<include "Cloud Contract">>


:: Cloud Contract 2 [surface]

Cloud stands before you, holding a small, innocuous-looking vial. His usual playful demeanor is gone, replaced by a serious, almost regretful expression.

<<say $companionCloud>>I hope this doesn't bother you too much. Personally, I find it distasteful, but rules are rules. This little concoction here? It's insurance. A fail-safe. You understand, don't you? In our line of work, we can't leave loose ends.<</say>>
He turns the vial in his hands, the liquid inside catching the light ominously.

<<say $companionCloud>>If you don't make good on our deal, or if something... unfortunate happens to me, well, let's just say this ensures our partnership remains mutually beneficial. It's nothing personal, just good business. Now, bottoms up.<</say>>
Cloud extends the vial towards you, his eyes locked on yours. You hesitate for a moment, feeling the weight of the decision. With a deep breath, you take the vial from his hand. The glass is cool against your skin, a stark contrast to the warmth of anxiety spreading through your chest.

<button class="dark-btn obsidian" data-passage="Cloud Contract 3">Drink the vial</button>


:: Cloud Contract 3 [surface]

You lift the vial to your lips and tilt it back, letting the bitter liquid flow into your mouth. The taste is acrid, almost metallic, making you wince as you swallow. For a moment, nothing happens, and you wonder if it was all just for show.

Then, a tingling sensation begins in your throat, spreading rapidly through your body. It's not painful, but distinctly uncomfortable, like a thousand pinpricks dancing across your skin. Your heart rate quickens, and you feel a rush of adrenaline coursing through your veins.

As the sensation intensifies, you become acutely aware of every nerve in your body. Your senses seem to sharpen – colors appear more vivid, sounds clearer. You feel simultaneously energized and unsettled, as if your body is preparing for a threat it can't identify.

The feeling gradually subsides, leaving behind a lingering warmth in your chest and a slight metallic aftertaste in your mouth. You meet Cloud's gaze again, and his earlier regret has been replaced by his more typical smile.

<<say $companionCloud>>There we go. Not so bad, was it? Don't worry, you won't feel a thing unless... well, let's make sure it doesn't come to that. Remember, your fate is in your own hands now. Shall we get started on our grand adventure?<</say>>

I trust you understand the importance of my work and won't expect me to deviate from it unnecessarily.<</say>>
She pauses, her eyes flickering briefly to the side before meeting the player's gaze again.

<<say $companionSaeko>>That being said, I'm aware of the dangers we'll face. My knowledge of the Abyss and its effects should prove useful to our survival. Just... don't expect me to carry any heavy equipment. My strength lies in my mind, not my muscles.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>I understand, Saeko. Your expertise is exactly why I wanted you on this expedition. We'll make sure your research gets ample attention.<</say>>
Saeko's posture relaxes slightly, a ghost of a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth.

:: Surface Habitation [surface cards nobr]
<h1>Habitation</h1>
<p>
@@.floatr;[img[setup.ImagePath+'icon.png']]@@

You'll find Habitation options just like this one on every layer of the Abyss. These represent possible "endings" to yout journey, givinh you an idea of what happens after you decide to settle down. 
You might end up choosing one the options down in the Abyss due to finding that you don't have enough supplies to make it back to the surface,
or because you don't want to take on more Curses to be able to ascend through the Miasma - or perhaps you'll simply fall in love with one of the layers down there and never want to leave. It happens sometimes.
<br><br>
After picking a Habitation option, your fate will be locked, sealing you permanently in the layer you choose and foiling future attempts to change your mind and leave.
This also applies if you spend two consecutive days on the surface after having previously been down in the Abyss - the Miasma will adapt and grow to reject your body,
preventing you from entering the Abyss once more and forcing you into the surface's Habitation option.
Furthermore, Habitation options are all locked away by fate untill you choose them - you can't actually interact with Habitation options or poerntially make use of them on your quest prior to choosing them and settling down.
@@font-style:italic;You cannot choose a Habitation option when your corruption points are lower than 0.@@
<br><br>
What your companions do after you pick a Habitation option will largely depend on their temperament, and how well you've treated them on your adventure.
Did you woo them and steal their heart? making them want to spend the rest of their days with you? Or did you merely treat them as tools, exploiting them for gain?
Some characters, like cloud, have a vested interest in the surface and would need a great deal more convincing to stay down in the Abyss permanently...while, for example, Cherry would be a bit of challange to convince to live @@font-style:italic;anywhere@@, let alone return to her life on the surface. Keep things like that in mind when thinking about how your ending will go. If necessary, companions may attempt to return to the surface on their own if you decide to stay down there -
 the return trip is perilous for them than it is for you, after all.

	Stepping into the shop, you're immediately greeted by a spectacle of Relics, in varying stages of packaging, ready to be shipped off to unknown buyers across the globe.

	The proprietor, a man busy sealing a vintage vacuum cleaner into a metal crate labelled "Fire Hazard; DO NOT DISTURB," glances your way, sizing you up in a brief moment. His nonchalant demeanor indicates he doesn't find you particularly interesting or a potential buyer. 

	<<say $relicBuyer>>If the Abyss happens to lure you in, do visit again. I'd be delighted to buy any Relics you're willing to part with - for a fair price, naturally.<</say>>
	He points to a peculiar handheld meter perched on the counter. As he moves it near a Relic, it begins to tick, a mechanism he uses to calculate a "fair" price, given that divers have nowhere else to sell unless they complete their dive.

[img[setup.ImagePath+$items[19].image]]

You step into the Relic Workshop of Outset Town. The air is thick with the smell of glue, sawdust, and molten metal. You see a couple of other adventurers tinkering away at Relics they found themselves. You approach one of the free workbenches and decide what you want to do.
<<nobr>>
<<for _relic range $ownedRelics>>

		<<elseif _relic.name == "Rømer Stones">>
			<br>You muse over what you can do with the Rømer Stones, taking advantage over their ability for limitless small-scale heating or cooling.<br>
			<br>You can either craft self-warming winter gear using winter clothes available, or you could use some light summer clothing to craft some self-cooling summer gear. Either one of these will require using all of the Rømer stones to craft.<br>

			<</if>>
		<<elseif _relic.name == "Creepy Doll" && !$dollevent>>
			<br>You are intrigued by the doll and its warm yet creepy aura. Perhaps you want to take a peek inside and see whether it truly is a doll or if its something different entirely that merely takes on the appearance of a doll.<br>
			<button class="dark-btn obsidian" data-passage="Doll event">Use scissors to cut open the doll</button><br>
		<<elseif _relic.name == "Brave Vector" && $slingshot === 0>>
			<br>The Brave Vector seems like it should have some application as a weapon, but it turns out that it is exceedingly difficult to use a bent pipe like that as a gun substitute. Luckily, with the help of the resident Relic experts, you can change the form of the Brave Vector to a much more useful one. They seem to recommend a sort of metal slingshot design, which should be able to function like a gun, but will be able to use anything of approximately the correct size as ammo.<br>
			<button class="dark-btn obsidian" data-passage="Surface Workshop" data-setter="$slingshot = 1">Reshape the Brave Vector into a powerful slingshot</button><br>
		<<elseif _relic.name == "Joyous Sunder" && $joyousSword === 0>>
			<br>The Joyous Sunder is an incredibly powerful offensive tool, but it is limited by its form as a small knife. Luckily, with the help of the local Relic Engineers, you can reshape this Relic into a true sword that an expert swordsman would feel comfortable using. A weapon like that would be literally unstoppable by any enemy that can be defeated by physical attacks and does not disable the user before they can get close enough to use it. This would be most useful in the hands of someone like Khemia, letting him defeat powerful beasts from the depths of the Abyss without fear of injury himself. <br>
			<button class="dark-btn obsidian" data-passage="Surface Workshop" data-setter="$joyousSword = 1">Reshape the Joyous Sunder into a true sword</button><br>
		<<elseif _relic.name == "Moonwatcher" && !$BionicEye>>
			<br>As you contemplate the potential benefits of the Moonwatcher serving as a bionic eye, an almost electric thrill runs through you. The thought of gaining night vision and the ability to see through objects seems incredibly appealing. Here, at the Relic Workshop, they can safely perform the installation for you.<br>

Can one truly claim the title of a surfaced diver, when your sole achievement lies in the journey to Outset Town, only to gaze upon the Abyss from the safety of the horizon? As you deliberate, you conclude that perhaps plunging into the unknown depths of the Abyss may not be the wisest decision. Often, it may be smarter to step away from perilous adventures, opting for a quiet life that still rewards you with a healthy sum with minimal risk.

After all, is bravery only found in testing the limits of danger? Or can it also lie in the wisdom of knowing when to avoid potentially hazardous pursuits, and yet come out richer in more ways than one? You may not return with the spoils of a daring quest, laden with the Relics of the Abyss, but you hold something just as valuable - a chance to decide your future on your own terms.

Your eyes take in the picturesque beauty of Outset Town, a promising land rich in potential. And within it, you see opportunities unfettered by the Curses that can befall those who venture too deep into the Abyss. Here, on the surface, there is potential for a new life, one that may be as simple as a peaceful existence.

Whether you decide to reside in the comfort of Outset Town, or to seek adventures of a different nature across the world, you hold the power to shape your own destiny. You step into the future - a future where the possibilities are as vast as the Abyss you've chosen to leave untouched.

Due to your significant haul of loot from the Abyss, you live a rich and comfortable life after your journey. You become somewhat of a legend in Outset Town, and people started coming to you for advice when going on their own Abyss dives.

Due to your well-known lucrative expedition with so few side effects, you wrote and marketed a very successful book titled "Finding the Gold in the Darkness, a Guide to Abyssal Success by $mc.name". The book became a smashing success, adding to your already comfortable bank account.

Of course not everyone who bought it was as successful as you in the Abyss, and not all of them came back rich or with the same form they went in with, but no one can blame you for that. Your healthy book sales continue throughout your life, ensuring your wealth after the expedition never fades and you have a comfortable living situation for as long as you desire.

You manage to come back from the Abyss relatively unscathed by the corruption of the miasma, but unfortunately also without an enormous haul of loot.

You sank a small fortune into your expedition (even if it was gifted to you) and you have little to show for it in the end. Maybe Abyss diving wasn't quite for you in the end?

You head back to your home and essentially pick up life where it was left off $time days ago. While it seems like not much has changed, your time and experiences in the Abyss will always stay with you and the memories of your expedition will stay with you for the rest of your life.

You manage to come back from the Abyss relatively unscathed, but with quite a haul of loot you can use to build a small fortune.

However, you did lose a significant amount of years. But that's a small price to pay for your newly acquired wealth, and in a few years you'll be back to your adult self anyway, right? It's not like it was some sort of permanent change to yourself.

The reality turned out to be a good bit more troublesome. Because of your age people had a hard time believing you were actually the successful diver they'd heard about. When you tried to sell advice to enterprising divers, you found that they weren't interested in listening to you, despite your mostly successful experience. Either they thought you were a fraudulent child or your age reduction proved the failure of your voyage.

In the end, you had trouble because of your age in nearly every aspect of your life. When going to parties you were shooed away unless someone vouched for you. When buying a new house the seller wouldn't accept your money without the presence of an adult, for fear of illegally making a contract with a child. Of course any sort of love life needed to be put on hold, as no one you would want to be with would accept a relationship with someone who appeared to be a little <<PerceivedGender $mc>>. Even the simple inability to get a driver's license brought you nearly endless headaches when trying to travel somewhere without public transport (and ride sharing services didn't take children due to legal liabilities.)

In the end, you had to spend a considerable amount of your fortune to hire a legal guardian to take care of the many issues that seemed to pop up in the years while you grew up a second time. The woman you hired was pretty helpful and loyal, presumably because you payed her so well, but you were still happy to see her go after you turned 18 again.

Once you reached your second adulthood, you could finally enjoy the small amount that was left of diving treasure and the respect that was deserved of a successful diver such as yourself.

When you come back you seem to not only have much of your age melted away, but also without much of a haul of valuable loot. Although people were generally accepting towards you, there were a number of problems that popped up due to your new age, which you unfortunately didn't have the dubloons to resolve smoothly.

People already had a hard time believing you were a diver, even if they knew some divers did come back younger. But you also had trouble with finding an apartment that would allow you to sign the lease and would fit into your budget. When you thought you had found an affordable apartment, they refused to let you sign a lease because "you were just a kid" and thus not able to legally sign the contract. Apparently the laws made to help former divers with reduced age mean nothing if people don't believe you aren't just some random kid.

After a while, many people simply viewed you as a homeless kid with a wild imagination, and you were forcibly assigned a legal guardian by the city. Your assigned guardian was strict and treated you as the child they believed you to be, completely with early bedtimes and a return to school.

Luckily, this was only a temporary state of affairs and eventually you did reach the age of 18 once again, leading to your complete legal freedom. Now that you were an adult again, you had a whole new adventure to embark on, the rest of your life.

Upon your return from the Abyss, you were a changed person, though some may not consider you to be as much of a person as you were before.

You were now a wealthy <<PerceivedGender $mc>>, but at the cost of some of your perceived humanity. Despite the fact that on the inside you were still the same person, many of the people on the surface didn't view you quite the same way.

While not everybody was intolerant, you felt that in many ways you were shunned by many parts of the local community, even around Outset Town. The main people you felt some kinship with was fellow divers who had also been Curses by the corrupting miasma of the Abyss.

Of course it was even worse if you traveled farther from the Abyss, so you tended to keep nearby to avoid being branded a "demon" or "devil-worshiper" by people who didn't understand you. And while Outset Town did have laws to prevent discrimination against corrupted divers, they were rarely enforced. And many people feared that you might be some sort of sex-maniac who was unable to control your urges around people, despite not having any problems of the sort occur when you were on the surface.

After a while, you felt that you could put your riches to better use by starting an organization where former divers with more serious Curses could congregate, while also promoting awareness and tolerance for Cursed divers around Outset Town.

In the end, your efforts did help somewhat, and there was far less open fear of divers who were touched by the Abyss, but you still felt more at ease in your mansion on the outskirts of town.

You might talk to someone on the phone, get a price, arrive for a tour, then get told the unit was sold and no longer available. You heard rumblings about some divers apparently being difficult clients to deal with, and despite the fact you never caused a problem, it seems that was projected onto you too.

Finding a job wasn't much easier, unfortunately. In the end, and ex-diver named Harry employed you in his store and you shared an apartment with him. He had green, slimy skin, but he was a kind man that was always fair in his treatment of you.

You now spend your days working in the store or participating in movements for fairer treatment of people with visibly inhuman afflictions.

While you funded the whole organization, Sheela managed the day-to-day affairs with the apparent children in the shelter. Sometimes it was nice to enjoy the fruits of your labor and spend some time relaxing in the shelter yourself, pretending you weren't the owner and you could just relax. And of course, getting soft pats from Sheela was always nice as well.

After living with Sheela for a while, you began to feel guilty for taking so much from her, without being able to give her enough in return. When you told her your thoughts, tears began to flow down her face. She explained that her foxy ears and tail were not the only side-effects of her time as a diver, she had also been Cursed with absolute infertility. In her younger years it hadn't mattered as much to her, but by now she had yearned for children of her own, and taking care of you had brought her great joy in life. For years she had regretted her expedition, the meager earnings not worth the cost she paid, but now she was content with her life, accepting what had happened and accepting how her life had eventually turned out.

Despite being an adult on the inside, you had formed a deep bond as she protected you from a world that viewed you as a child, and when she revealed her true feelings you couldn't help but hug her tightly. Many tears were shed on both sides that night.

From that point on, you felt like you had formed a nice, though odd, family connection with her. Eventually you grew up, but you kept a strong connection with her for the rest of your life.

However, you also developed an almost unquenchable thirst for sex due to the corrupting influence of the Abyss in your life. At first you began throwing exorbitant parties at you new estate. In many ways, your money made you feel like Gatsby himself.

However, over time you build up an infamous reputation among the people of Outset Town due to your focus on sex above almost all other things in life. The police show up due to public disturbances during a few of your parties, killing the typical debaucherous mood.

Eventually, you used the rest of your fortune to found an exotic brothel in Outset Town, where you hired many former divers with mutations and particularly high libidos or sexual compulsions. You also found that many wealthy divers with Curses felt more at home near Outset Town and were drawn to an outlet for their sexual frustrations, creating a great business opportunity for you.

While managing the brothel was certainly not always easy, it never ceased to be enjoyable for you.

Unfortunately, it was not such a kind place to help people deal with their afflictions, it was instead a cruel place where people were forced to conform so that they did not cause problems for the "normal" people.

In that facility you were degraded and forced to follow the strictest of lifestyles, with your actions heavily constrained by the nurses and guards present. They kept in purposefully child-like areas, sometimes even resembling cribs for mere infants. You regularly had meetings with doctors, though who knows if they truly had degrees, who insisted that you must be a child and must restrain yourself from any impure impulse.

She sighs deeply, pinching the bridge of her nose in exasperation. The fluorescent lights overhead flicker momentarily, as if sharing in her frustration.

<<say $loanLady>>I'm afraid that's not possible, and believe me, we've had to learn that lesson the hard way. There was this one catgirl who... well, let's just say we've sealed that particular loophole tighter than a bandit's cell in the local prison. It's not a problem anymore, thankfully.<</say>>
The officer shakes her head, a wry smile playing at the corners of her mouth. She straightens a stack of papers on her desk, the sound crisp in the quiet office.

In the midst of a bustling scene, you observe a middle-aged man engrossed in conversation with a pair of novice divers. He appears to be advising them on their packing strategy while they listen attentively, processing his words as they organize their supplies. Upon finishing with them, he pats their shoulders, throws them a reassuring smile, and strides in your direction.

<<say $tipGuy>>I see you're prepping for a dive. Mind if I share some wisdom?<</say>>
Given the inherent risks of diving, it seems like a good idea to take any guidance offered.

<<say $mc>>Sure, what kind of advice do you have?<</say>>
A subtle chuckle escapes him, accompanied by a small shake of his head.

<<say $tipGuy>>To tailor my advice, I need to understand what you're worried about. What is it that you dread encountering in the Abyss? Then I could help you with avoiding or dealing with them. So tell me, what are you afraid of finding deep down in the Abyss?<</say>>
You take a moment to reflect on his question before responding.

:: Surface Diver Tips 2

<<if $fear === "darkness">>
<<say $tipGuy>>Ah, the darkness can indeed be intimidating. Luckily, the Abyss itself provides light in most of its layers. There is, however, a zone beyond the lush rainforest-like area where light becomes quite scarce.<</say>>
He nonchalantly gestures towards a nearby shop.

<<say $tipGuy>>Navigating these darker regions can be easier with a flashlight or smartphone, available at the shop. Torches may seem like a good option, but their single-use life-span could be insufficient for the prolonged darkness you might encounter.<</say>>
<<elseif $fear === "spiders">>
<<say $tipGuy>>Fortunately, the Abyss isn't home to any spiders that are particularly threatening. You may come across some, but they're no different than their surface-dwelling counterparts.<</say>>
He grins wryly.

<<say $tipGuy>>And I trust you can handle those, at least.<</say>>
<<elseif $fear === "wolves">>
<<say $tipGuy>>Strictly speaking, the Abyss isn't home to <i>wolves</i>. However, some creatures residing in the upper layers bear a resemblance.<</say>>
Shrugging, he conveys a sense of ease despite the potential threat.

<<say $tipGuy>>Thankfully, they pose a minor threat compared to other Abyss-dwelling creatures. Any weapon you bring should keep them at bay — a few strikes of a sword or gunshots should do. In case you're without a weapon, leaving some food rations behind would also divert their attention. And they likely won't bother you at all if you're in a large enough group.<</say>>
<<elseif $fear === "snakes">>
<<say $tipGuy>>While there aren't any special <i>snakes</i> in the Abyss, colossal worms have been reported deep down, in the fifth layer. These worms burrow through the sand in search of water, their sheer size making them invulnerable to any weaponry.<</say>>
Shrugging, he takes a swig from his water bottle.

<<say $tipGuy>>On the bright side, they're easily distracted. Leaving some of your water behind should attract them, allowing you to escape. Carrying a significant extra water supply is advisable if you're venturing that deep.<</say>>
<<elseif $fear === "insects">>
<<say $tipGuy>>Regrettably, the Abyss harbors a variety of bothersome insects. The first few layers house some bizarre bees and kite dragons, but they're essentially harmless.<</say>>
He involuntarily shivers, then exhales sharply before continuing.

<<say $tipGuy>>However, in the deepest explored parts, swarms of insects can delay your journey. Shelter is your best bet against them, though you'll need to spend a day's worth of supplies to wait them out. I hated those encounters. I've never been a fan of bugs.<</say>>
He looks you over and thinks for a moment.

<<say $tipGuy>>While some may try to travel through the swarm, I'd advise laying low and waiting it out.<</say>>
<</if>>

<button class="dark-btn obsidian" data-passage="Surface Diver Tips 3">Ask him for any other advice he has</button>

:: Surface Diver Tips 3

<<if $mc.inhuman < 2 >>\
	The experienced diver waits patiently for any other questions you might have before you descend into the Abyss.

	<<say $tipGuy>>Is there anything else you wanted to ask me about?<</say>>
<<elseif $mc.inhuman < 6 >>\
	The experienced diver seems to be curious if you have any other questions you might have before you return to the Abyss.

	<<say $tipGuy>>Is there anything else you wanted to ask me about? Given that you've already begun your dive, I'm sure you're already learning by experience.<</say>>
<<else>>\
	The experienced diver seems to be eyeing you cautiously, obviously wary of you due to your appearance, as if he's worried you could fly off the handle at any moment.

	<<say $tipGuy>>Is there anything else you wanted to ask me about? It seems you've had quite a bit more experience than me.<</say>>
	He hesitates for a moment before adding one more comment.

	<<say $tipGuy>>Well, if you do want a piece of advice? I'd say you should end your dive here, while you still have a hint of your humanity and your mind is still intact. I know it can be tempting to continue, but honestly, I don't think it's worth it. I suppose that might be why I ended my dive with so few side effects...<</say>>

<<if $temp === 0>>
The veteran adventurer arches an eyebrow and cracks a knowing grin.

<<say $tipGuy>>Well, if I had the answer to that, I'd probably be the grand sage of the Abyss. Truth is, no soul has ever reached its deepest depths or, if they have, they never made the return journey. Makes it a tad tricky to say what's really down there, doesn't it?<</say>>
His hand raises, fingers splayed out to show the number five.

<<say $tipGuy>>However, I can tell you this: there are five known levels. From surface-like groves to shadowy caverns, even icy landscapes. We all know the Abyss stretches deeper, but those who've ventured past the fifth layer have never returned to tell the tale.<</say>>
A broad smile spreads across his weathered face as he sizes you up.

<<say $tipGuy>>Perhaps you'll be the pioneer to conquer the sixth layer and live to tell the tale. Or maybe you'd rather stick to a less demanding shallow dive. Or are you like those overconfident souls who dive too deep into the darkness, never to feel the sun's warmth again?<</say>>
He shrugs nonchalantly.

<<say $tipGuy>>Regardless of your choice, I recommend giving it a good, hard thought. Every adventurer's path is their own to choose.<</say>>
<<elseif $temp === 1>>
<<say $tipGuy>>Your preparedness will depend on how deep you want to dive and whether you plan to forage as you go.<</say>>
The grizzled adventurer holds up two fingers, forming a V.

<<say $tipGuy>>If you're well-versed in foraging, you could survive the first two layers with minimal supplies. Beyond that, however, even the most seasoned Abyssal explorers would be foolhardy to go unprepared.<</say>>
The aged diver strokes his chin thoughtfully before continuing.

<<say $tipGuy>>There have been expeditions that ventured as far as the fifth layer, lasting several months. With the right amount of supplies and a skilled guide, it's possible to survive that long. That could be a benchmark for your preparation if you want to go deep.<</say>>
He fixes you with a stern gaze and his tone grows serious.

<<say $tipGuy>>But if you're cutting it close with your supplies, don't press your luck. Overconfidence can be fatal in the Abyss. There's a fine line between bravery and foolishness. Choose wisely.<</say>>
<<elseif $temp === 2>>
The seasoned diver chuckles, shaking his head as if amused by your naïveté.

<<say $tipGuy>>The Abyss isn't exactly an idyllic vacation spot.<</say>>
He pauses, then continues with a more serious tone.

<<say $tipGuy>>There are some who have found contentment in the upper layers, but the deeper you go, the more dangerous and unpredictable it becomes. Our laws and morals don't carry much weight there, so beware.<</say>>
He takes a sip from his water bottle and lets out a deep sigh.

<<say $tipGuy>>Usually, folks who settle in the deeper layers don't have much choice. It's a last resort, a means of survival. But there are layers down there where I'd take my chances with death instead. But who knows, maybe you'd find some beauty amidst the chaos? Remember, I'm a surface man at heart.<</say>>
<<elseif $temp === 3>>
The old adventurer shrugs nonchalantly.

<<say $tipGuy>>Once you're deep into the Abyss, the only thing that really matters is whether you can find a powerful Relic to safeguard your survival. And that's a long shot, my friend.<</say>>
His gaze sweeps across the gathered divers in the town's center, their various mutations and quirks on display: odd skin colors, pointed ears, some openly propositioning passersby, others flaunting their wealth, and a few who seemed much too young to be in this line of work.

<<say $tipGuy>>Up here on the surface, things are different. How human you appear, your level of sexuality, the amount of wealth you bring back, and your apparent age all matter. If you return looking less than human, people tend to view you as an Abyssal creature, not fit for civil society. If your sexuality becomes overly pronounced, you might end up in undesirable professions. On the other hand, returning with valuable Relics could set you up for a comfortable life, despite any other challenges. If you come back looking like a kid, well, people might not take you seriously as an adventurer, making it hard to live a normal adult life.<</say>>
His attention returns to you, his eyes serious and full of wisdom.

<<say $tipGuy>>So, choose wisely when you're down there. The Abyss doesn't forgive easily and the consequences of your decisions can change the course of your life. It's not a place to take lightly.<</say>>
<<elseif $temp === 4>>
<<say $tipGuy>>Ah, here in Outset Town we've got a special Relic that's been around since my diving days. It resembles some bizarre robotic monstrosity but it's actually rather helpful.<</say>>
<<say $tipGuy>>Its purpose is to locate and rescue infants in the Abyss, using some strange sensor to keep watch. When it spots a baby, it swoops down and brings the little one safely back to town to be cared for until their parents return. It's unthinkable to leave infants in such a dangerous place!<</say>>
<<say $tipGuy>>There were attempts to figure out its workings, perhaps modify it for other tasks, but alas, none were successful. These days, we just appreciate its help and let it do its thing.<</say>>
He lifts his shoulders in a resigned shrug, indicating his lack of further insight on the matter.

:: Surface Khemia Tips 2

<<if $fear === "darkness">>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Darkness, huh? No worries! The Abyss itself lights up most of its layers with the natural miasma. It's pretty awesome, actually.<</say>>
He gestures enthusiastically towards a nearby shop.

<<say $companionKhemia>>But there is this zone past the lush rainforest-like area where it gets pretty dark. For those spots, grab yourself a flashlight or smartphone from that shop over there. Trust me, I've been through those dark patches more times than I can count – you'll want that extra light.<</say>>
<<elseif $fear === "spiders">>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Spiders? Ha! The ones in the Abyss are nothing compared to the serious challenges you'll face. They're just like the ones up here – more scared of you than you are of them.<</say>>
He grins widely, playfully jabbing your shoulder.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Besides, with guns blazing and swords swinging, those little critters won't stand a chance against a tough adventurer like you!<</say>>
<<elseif $fear === "wolves">>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Wolves? Well, not exactly wolves, but there are some wolf-like creatures in the upper layers. Nothing a seasoned adventurer can't handle though!<</say>>
He unsheathes a sword at his hip, swinging it with practiced ease.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Any weapon you bring should keep them at bay. A few strikes with a blade like this, or some well-placed shots, and they'll think twice about messing with you. No weapon? No problem! Toss some food rations their way as a distraction. Or better yet, team up with a group – safety in numbers, right? Trust me, I've faced down packs of these beasts more times than I can count!<</say>>
<<elseif $fear === "snakes">>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Snakes? Nah, but let me tell you about something even crazier – giant worms! These behemoths lurk in the fifth layer, burrowing through sand looking for water. They're so massive, weapons just bounce off 'em!<</say>>
He mimes an exaggerated worm motion with his arm, his eyes gleaming with excitement.

<<say $companionKhemia>>But here's the trick – they're easily distracted. Leave some water behind, and they'll go for that instead of you. It's all about outsmarting the Abyss, you know? Pack extra water if you're heading that deep. I always say, 'Be prepared, or prepare to fail!'<</say>>
<<elseif $fear === "insects">>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Insects, huh? Yeah, the Abyss has its fair share of creepy crawlies. The upper layers have these wild bees and kite dragons – pretty harmless though, and cool to watch!<</say>>
He scratches his chin, a determined look crossing his face.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Now, in the deeper parts, you'll encounter massive swarms that can slow you down. Your best bet is to find shelter and wait 'em out. It'll cost you a day's supplies, but it's better than trying to push through. Trust me, I've done both – waiting is definitely the way to go, unless you're... a particular sort of person.<</say>>
He looks you over, nodding approvingly.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Remember, in the Abyss, sometimes the bravest thing you can do is know when to hunker down and let danger pass.<</say>>

	Khemia's eyes widen slightly as he takes in your clearly inhuman appearance, but his enthusiasm doesn't waver. If anything, he seems even more intrigued.

	<<say $companionKhemia>>Whoa, you've really been through the wringer, haven't you? That's impressive! I bet you've got some wild stories to tell. Any questions for me? I mean, you've probably seen more than I have at this point.<</say>>
	He pauses for a moment, his expression growing more serious.

	<<say $companionKhemia>>Look, I know the pull of the Abyss is strong. Heck, I feel it every time I go down there. But maybe consider taking a breather up here for a while? You've still got a bit of your humanity left, and trust me, that's worth holding onto. Then again, who am I to talk? I keep going back down there myself!<</say>>
	He chuckles, shaking his head before focusing back on you.

<<if $temp === 0>>
Khemia's eyes light up with unbridled excitement, and he leans in closer, his voice brimming with enthusiasm.

<<if $mc.appGender > 5>>\
<<say $companionKhemia>>Now that's the million-dollar question! If I knew the answer, I'd probably be the king of the Abyss or something. Truth is, no one's ever reached the bottom – or if they have, they never made it back to tell the tale. Makes it all the more thrilling, doesn't it? Just imagine being the first woman to uncover those secrets!<</say>>
<<else>>\
<<say $companionKhemia>>Now that's the million-dollar question! If I knew the answer, I'd probably be the king of the Abyss or something. Truth is, no one's ever reached the bottom – or if they have, they never made it back to tell the tale. Makes it all the more thrilling, doesn't it? Just think about being the man who cracks that mystery!<</say>>
<</if>>\
He holds up his hand, fingers spread wide to show the number five.

<<say $companionKhemia>>We know of five main layers, each more incredible than the last. From surface-like groves to shadowy caverns and even icy landscapes. But beyond the fifth? That's the great unknown, my friend. No one's ever returned from past that point.<</say>>
His grin widens as he gives you an appraising look, clearly impressed by your curiosity.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Who knows? Maybe you'll be the one to crack the sixth layer and live to tell about it! Or maybe you'll play it safe with a shallow dive. Either way, it's your choice. Just remember, the deeper you go, the greater the challenge – and the greater the reward!<</say>>
He punches the air excitedly.

<<say $companionKhemia>>And if you do plan on breaking through to the sixth layer? Think about giving me a call. I want to be the first one to make it that deep and come back alive.<</say>>
<<elseif $temp === 1>>
<<if $mc.appGender > 5>>\
<<say $companionKhemia>>Great question, beautiful! It all depends on how deep you're planning to go and whether you're up for some Abyss foraging. A smart lady like you probably knows it's all about preparation.<</say>>
<<else>>\
<<say $companionKhemia>>Great question! It all depends on how deep you're planning to go and whether you're up for some Abyss foraging. A tough guy like you probably knows it's all about being ready for anything.<</say>>
<</if>>\
Khemia holds up two fingers, his eyes gleaming with excitement.

<<say $companionKhemia>>If you're a foraging pro like yours truly, you could survive the first two layers with minimal supplies.<</say>>
He strokes his chin thoughtfully, his expression becoming more serious.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Now, for the deeper layers, even seasoned explorers like me pack heavy. I've been on expeditions that lasted several months, going as far as the fifth layer. With the right supplies and a skilled guide – like myself – it's totally doable. Though I wouldn't say it's a great idea to spend all your money on rations when you're just starting out.<</say>>
He fixes you with an intense gaze, his tone becoming more earnest.

<<say $companionKhemia>>But listen up, this is important: don't push your luck with supplies. I've seen too many good adventurers fall because they thought they could stretch their rations just a little further. There's a fine line between bravery and recklessness in the Abyss. Be smart, be prepared, and you'll have a much better shot at making it back in one piece!<</say>>
<<elseif $temp === 2>>
Khemia lets out a hearty laugh, slapping his thigh in amusement.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Pleasant? Well, that depends on your definition of 'pleasant'! If you enjoy heart-pounding adventure and breathtaking, otherworldly sights, then sure, it's a regular paradise!<</say>>
His expression becomes more thoughtful as he continues.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Look, I won't sugarcoat it. The upper layers can be pretty amazing, and I know some folks have made a decent life there. But the deeper you go, the more dangerous and unpredictable it gets. Our surface rules don't mean much down there, so you've gotta be prepared for anything.<</say>>
He takes a quick swig from his water bottle, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Most people who settle in the deeper layers do it out of necessity, not choice. It's a survival thing. Maybe you're the type who thrives on chaos and danger! Me? I love the thrill of exploring the depths, but I always come back up. There's something about feeling the sun on your face after weeks in the Abyss that can't be beat.<</say>>
<<elseif $temp === 3>>
Khemia's expression turns serious, though his eyes still sparkle with excitement.

<<say $companionKhemia>>When you're deep in the Abyss, your best bet is finding a powerful Relic to keep you alive.<</say>>
His gaze sweeps across the gathered divers, taking in their various mutations and quirks: odd skin colors, pointed ears, some openly propositioning passersby, others flaunting their wealth, and a few who seemed much too young for this dangerous profession.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Up here on the surface, it's a whole different ball game. How human you look, your sexuality, the wealth you bring back, even your apparent age – it all matters. Come back looking less than human, and people might treat you like you're some Abyssal creature. Get too... let's say 'enthusiastic' about certain aspects of life, and you might find yourself in some unsavory situations. But bring back valuable Relics, and you could be set for life, no matter what other changes you've gone through.<</say>>
He turns back to you, his expression a mix of excitement and caution.

<<say $companionKhemia>>So, when you're down there, choose wisely. The Abyss is unforgiving, and your decisions can change your life forever. But that's what makes it so thrilling! It's not just about survival, it's about coming back better than when you left. Are you up for the challenge?<</say>>
<<elseif $temp === 4>>
<<say $companionKhemia>>Ah, now that's a bit hard to explain. But suffice to say, the babies end up safe. You'd be surprised how many end up being born down there, and we manage to take care of them until their parents come back up. I'm almost surprised the system works so well.<</say>>
He shakes his head, chuckling in amazement.
<<elseif $temp === 5>>
Khemia's eyes light up with excitement, a broad grin spreading across his face.

<<if $mc.appGender > 5>>\
<<say $companionKhemia>>Well, well, aren't you full of great ideas, beautiful? I'd be more than happy to guide a lovely adventurer like yourself through the Abyss.<</say>>
<<else>>\
<<say $companionKhemia>>Now that's what I like to hear! Always good to team up with another brave soul for an Abyss dive.<</say>>
<</if>>\
He strokes his chin thoughtfully for a moment before continuing.

<<say $companionKhemia>>As for my fee, it's 170 dubloons. I know it might sound steep, but trust me, it's worth every coin. You're not just getting a guide; you're getting decades of Abyss experience, top-notch combat skills, and all the shortcuts I've discovered over the years.<</say>>
He leans in closer, his voice taking on a more authoritative tone.

<<say $companionKhemia>>Plus, I can guarantee we'll shave at least two days off the usual travel time. Time is life down there, and I'm all about keeping my clients alive and kicking. So, what do you say? Ready to take on the Abyss with the best guide in the business?<</say>>

	While strolling toward the town, you abruptly hear someone shouting in your direction.

	<<say $rndM>> Why don't you crawl back into that cursed hole and live with those monsters if you want to be one so badly! <</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Huh? What? I don't... <</say>>
	Before you can finish your sentence, he forcefully shoves you as he storms past.

	<<say $mc>> Hey! <</say>>
	<<say $rndM>> Freak. <</say>>
	He saunters away, leaving you flabbergasted. As you glance around, you notice some people shaking their heads at the brutish man, while others glare at you with disgust.

<<else>>
	As you approach a local diner to grab a bite, a large imposing man blocks the entrance.
	
	<<say $rndM>> Sorry, full. <</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Oh, really? When did this diner get so popular that it needs a doorman? I remember it being quite mellow. <</say>>
	<<say $rndM>> Just now. <</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Uh... Okay. Well, good day then. <</say>>
	The doorman scoffs. As you walk away, you see someone else enter the diner without the doorman even bothering to get up. Confused, you return, and the doorman blocks the entrance once again.
	
	<<say $mc>> I thought it was full? <</say>>
	<<say $rndM>> It is. <</say>>
	<<say $mc>> But this other guy... <</say>>
	<<say $rndM>> Let me be clear. It's full for you, so I suggest you move along. <</say>>
	Not wanting to start a fight to enter a place that clearly doesn't want you, you grumble and move on.

<</if>>
<<elseif $mc.inhuman > 6>>
	You find yourself wandering through town when you realize you're lost. You decide to ask for directions from a passerby.

	<<say $mc>> I'm sorry, can I ask you a question? I... <</say>>
	<<say $rndF>> I'd rather you didn't. <</say>>
	<<say $mc>> Excuse me? I just want to know where... <</say>>
	<<say $rndF>> There. You need to go back there, where you belong. <</say>>
	She points in the direction of the Abyss and walks off briskly.

	<<say $rndM>> Don't mind her. Some people are unfortunately like that. Now, where did you need to go? <</say>>
	<<say $mc>> The town's center... <</say>>
	This man is thankfully more helpful, providing clear instructions that guide you back to the heart of town.

<<elseif $mc.appAge < 8 && $hiredCompanions.length===0>><br><br>
	<<say $rndF>>Oh dear, have you lost your parents, little one?<</say>>
	<<say $mc>>I'm sorry?<</say>>
	You turn around to see a kind-looking woman standing beside you.

	<<say $rndF>>Don't worry, I'll help you find them. Just tell me what they look like.<</say>>
	She gently takes your hand and crouches down to be at eye level with you.

	<<say $mc>>Oh, no... There's been a misunderstanding. I'm not a child; I just appear to be one.<</say>>
	She looks at you, puzzled, then notices your gear. Her cheeks flush crimson.

	<<say $rndF>>Oh, I'm so sorry! I just assumed that... Well, good luck on your adventures, young <<PerceivedGender $mc>>. I mean, you're not young, of course. You could be a very mature <<PerceivedGender $mc>>. Or, you might not even identify as <<PerceivedGender $mc>>. I'm not saying that you don't look like it, but... Anyway, I'm quite busy. I hope you... uh, farewell.<</say>>
	She hurries away, looking incredibly flustered.

<<elseif $mc.appAge < 8>>
	<<say $rndF>>Oh, what a lovely child you have, if I may say so.<</say>>
	You glance to the side and notice an unfamiliar woman addressing $hiredCompanions[0].name.

	<<say $hiredCompanions[0]>>Were you talking to me?<</say>>
	<<say $rndF>>Yes, I'm sorry if I'm overstepping, but I can't help adoring adorable children.<</say>>
	As she speaks, she crouches down in front of you.

	<<say $hiredCompanions[0]>>Wait, do you mean...<</say>>
	At that moment, $hiredCompanions[0].name bursts into laughter.

	<<say $mc>>Hey, stop laughing! I'm not a kid.<</say>>
	<<if $hiredCompanions[0].id === setup.companionIds.khemia || $hiredCompanions[0].id === setup.companionIds.lily || $hiredCompanions[0].id === setup.companionIds.cloud>>

		<<say $rndF>>Oh, I know the type. I work at a daycare, and about half the kids think they're adults if they can tie their own shoes.<</say>>
		They both continue to laugh and chat for a few more minutes about you, much to your embarrassment. Thankfully, you move on afterward, but $hiredCompanions[0].name wears the most smug grin on <<if $hiredCompanions[0].sex === "male">>his<<else>>her<</if>> face for half the day.

		<<say $hiredCompanions[0]>>I'm sorry, ma'am, but there's been a funny misunderstanding. You see, <<Pronoun>> is actually an adult. We're explorers of the Abyss and...<</say>>
		Her expression suddenly hardens.

		<<say $rndF>>You people should be ashamed of yourselves.<</say>>
		She turns on her heel and walks off without another word.

<<elseif $mc.appAge < 16>>
	<<say $rndM>>Hey! You there!<</say>>
	A man in a distinctive uniform swiftly approaches you, his face etched with concern.

	<<say $rndM>>Mind explaining why you're not in school on a school day? And don't tell me you're sick.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>>Uh, because I finished school years ago?<</say>>
	The man opens his mouth to speak, but upon examining your gear, he facepalms instead.

	<<say $rndM>>Let me guess, Abyss explorer?<</say>>
	<<say $mc>>Yeah, why?<</say>>
	<<say $rndM>>Damn, that's the third time this month. You guys make my job a whole lot harder, you know?<</say>>
	<<say $mc>>Oh, I'm sorry.<</say>>
	He sighs deeply.

	<<say $rndM>>Don't worry about it; it's not entirely your fault. Well, maybe a little, but it's not your problem. Good luck with your travels.<</say>>
	With a resigned expression, he walks away.

<<elseif $mc.appGender < -5 && $mc.osex !== "male" && !$mc.switched>>
	You're taking a breather at the edge of a lively fountain in the town's main plaza when you notice a group of girls glancing your way.

	The moment you meet their gazes, they turn their heads away, whispering and giggling among themselves.

	<<say $mc>>Even here and now, I still have other girls gossiping about me.<</say>>
	You think to yourself, recalling similar experiences from your childhood. Although it's unlikely to result in bullying now, it still irks you.
	Suddenly, one of the girls stands up and approaches you.

	<<say $mc>>Guess I was wrong; here comes the insult party again...<</say>>
	You take mental notes of the girl's clothes, demeanor, and general appearance, preparing a witty comeback.

	<<say $rndF>>Excuse me, can I ask you a question?<</say>>
	<<say $mc>>Sure...<</say>>
	<<say $rndF>>So my friend over there thinks you're really cute, but she's a bit shy. Are you doing anything later today?<</say>>
	<<say $mc>>I, uh, have to go back to the Abyss at some point.<</say>>
	<<say $rndF>>Oh, cool, you're an explorer then! Well, if you're done exploring, you can probably find us here on most days. Good luck with your travels!<</say>>
	<<say $mc>>Thanks, I guess?<</say>>
	<<say $rndF>>Oh, and don't change too much; we BOTH like the way you look right now... a lot.<</say>>
	She offers a seductive wink before sauntering off. The encounter was quite different from what you had expected. You're amused not only by the compliment but also by the fact that both women are unaware of how much you've already changed!

<<elseif $mc.appGender > 10 && $mc.osex !== "female" && !$mc.switched >>
	You stroll along a cobblestone path when a sudden whistle catches your attention. Glancing around, you spot a group of men laying new cobblestones, grinning in your direction. Puzzled, you continue walking.

	<<say $rndM>>Damn, girl...<</say>>
	You whirl around this time.

	<<say $mc>>Uh, are you talking to me?<</say>>
	<<say $rndM>>Hell yeah, 'cause you look great in those pants.<</say>>
	<<say $mc>>Thanks?<</say>>
	<<say $rndM>>Although, I bet you'd look even better without them.<</say>>
	They exchange high-fives, and you decide it's best to ignore them and move on. The experience leaves you feeling slightly bewildered. You never thought you'd be catcalled. On one hand, it feels like they're mocking you, but on the other, it's because they're attracted to the body you've crafted in the Abyss.

	You spend some time musing over whether this is something you like or hate. A small giggle escapes you as you imagine telling these macho men that you were originally a guy, just to see how they'd react. Would they be surprised given your physical femininity? Or would they expect it, since they're in Outset Town? In the end, though, you just continue your journey.

:: Void Diamond Drink
<<= '<img src="' + setup.ImagePath + 'Wonders/voiddiamond.png" class="half-size">' >>

As you emerge from the depths of the Abyss, you cradle the Void Diamond — the night sky encapsulated in a crystal shard — its otherworldly sheen seems to clash with the mundane light of the surface world.

A week passes on the surface, the diamond exposed to the sun's rays and the fresh air. In this time, the once indestructible gem weakens, its form yielding to the pressures of a world it was not meant for.

With a keen sense of anticipation, you prepare the alchemical concoction. Crushing the weakened diamond into a fine, starry dust, you blend it with water and a few more ingredients to make the mixture palatable. The resulting potion is iridescent, shifting in color like oil on water, and emits a faint, otherworldly glow.

You raise the concoction to your lips, the scent is earthy with hints of the unknown depths from which it came. The first sip is bitter and slightly metallic, a taste reminiscent of ancient stone and forgotten winds. As the liquid courses through you, a warmth spreads from your core to your extremities.

Visions of the Abyss flood your senses: the strange flora, the echoing caverns, the cryptic ruins. You feel an intimate connection with this alien world, a harmony deep within you. Your body adapts, embracing the essence of the Abyss as its own.

As the potion's effects solidify, you realize the transformation is complete. You now possess an unprecedented affinity with the Abyss. The thought of eating its strange fruits, drinking its bizarre waters, and conversing with its enigmatic inhabitants no longer feels alien. A sense of belonging washes over you, meanwhile you feel a growing sense of alienation from the surface world.

Yet, the potion's boon comes with a binding curse. As days pass on the surface, a longing for the Abyss grows, an insatiable pull that gnaws at your spirit. You understand that your fate is now irrevocably intertwined with the Abyss, a symbiosis that grants you power and insight at the cost of eternal exile from the world above.

From this moment onwards, you are no longer a diver, but instead of denizen of the Abyss, your new home.

:: Surface Admin First Visit [surface]
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Surface/administration.png']]

As you approach the heart of Outset Town, a sturdy building looms before you. While not particularly grandiose, its facade of polished stone and modest columns lends it an air of authority. A wooden sign proclaims this structure as the town's Administrative Center.

The building's entrance bustles with activity. Divers, merchants, and locals alike stream in and out, seemingly too focused on their own business to notice you. The only hint that this building is near the Abyss are an occasional person with a minor inhuman characteristic, such as a young woman with elf ears, a young boy with a cat tail swaying behind him, or a man who seems more seasoned with scaly skin. Through the open doors, you catch glimpses of various service counters, each dedicated to the unique needs of a town living in the shadow of the unknown.

To your right, a animated conversation catches your attention. A man with tanned skin and striking green eyes leans casually against a pillar, his brown hair tousled as if by a playful breeze. His charismatic presence seems to light up the space around him as he chats with a female loan officer. Their hushed tones and the man's persuasive gestures suggest a discussion about someone's debt, though his charm appears to be working its magic on the stern-faced official.

:: Surface Relic First Visit [surface]

As you approach the Relic shop, your eyes are immediately drawn to the eclectic display in the window. Objects both mundane and extraordinary jostle for space, each one a potential treasure from the depths of the Abyss. A sign above the door proclaims "Relics Bought and Sold" in bright red letters.

Pushing open the door, you're greeted by a cacophony of sights and sounds. Shelves line the walls, crammed with an assortment of items that defy easy categorization. A pillow, looking just a touch too fluffy to be ordinary, sits next to a set of seemingly normal cooking pans. Your gaze is drawn to a small rock covered in pulsing red runes, and then to a fish-shaped water bottle that appears to wiggle every few moments.

Behind the counter, a middle-aged man with a skinny build and a gray ivy cap busies himself with various gadgets and gizmos. His sharp eyes dart between the items and a peculiar handheld meter, suggesting a method to his apparent madness of valuation.

As you take in the surroundings, your attention is caught by a figure weaving through the cluttered aisles. At first glance, you see a young woman in a cute dress, but as they turn, you realize it's actually a very feminine young man. His androgynous features are framed by striking blue hair that matches his wide, wonder-filled eyes. He moves from shelf to shelf with an air of fascination, fingers hovering just shy of touching the mysterious Relics.

As you approach the item store, you're greeted by a large, practical-looking building with wide display windows. Unlike the mysterious allure of the Relic shop, this establishment exudes a sense of pragmatism and necessity. A wilderness-themed sign above the entrance reads "Outset Outfitters: Everything a Diver Needs".

Stepping inside, you're immediately struck by the sheer variety of goods on offer. Shelves and racks stretch from floor to ceiling, laden with all manner of supplies essential for those brave (or foolish) enough to venture into the Abyss. The air is thick with the mingled scents of leather, metal, and preserved foods.

Your eyes roam over long-lasting rations stacked neatly beside rows of disposable water bottles and sturdy refillable flasks. One wall is dedicated to an impressive array of weapons - gleaming swords hang next to locked cases containing handguns of various calibers. Nearby, you spot neatly organized medkits, high-powered flashlights, coils of durable rope, and compasses guaranteed to function even in the Abyss's strange environment.

However, it's a section near the back that truly captures your attention. Here, unique items unavailable anywhere else are displayed prominently. A leather-bound tome with "Encyclopedia Abyssia" embossed in gold lettering sits on a pedestal, promising knowledge of the mysterious depths. Beside it, a curious collection of balloons with integrated pulley systems catches your eye. And finally, you notice a small shelf where two arm braces made of faintly glowing white wood rest, their otherworldly appearance hinting at powerful protective properties.

But suddenly, a commotion near the counter draws your attention. A young woman with vibrant lavender hair is engaged in an animated discussion with the shopkeeper. Her energy is palpable as she gesticulates wildly, pointing to a colorful book - unmistakably a manga - and then to a nearby shelf of practical items. The shopkeeper's bemused expression suggests this isn't an uncommon occurrence.

:: Surface Exit First Visit [surface]

As you approach the outskirts of Outset Town, the bustling sounds of commerce and chatter gradually fade, replaced by an eerie stillness. The path beneath your feet becomes rougher, transitioning from well-worn cobblestones to jagged rock. Ahead, you see the terrain suddenly drop away, marking the precipice of the infamous Abyss.

Drawing closer, you're struck by the sheer scale of what lies before you. The Abyss yawns open, a colossal maw in the earth that seems to defy comprehension. Its edges are ragged and uneven, as if the ground itself was violently torn asunder by some unimaginable force. Wisps of an otherworldly mist curl upwards from the depths, obscuring your view of what lies below.

A strange wind rises to meet you, carrying with it scents and sensations entirely foreign to the surface world. It's not a gust from any cardinal direction, but rather an upward draft from the very bowels of the earth.

Near the edge, atop a jutting rock formation, sits a solitary figure. A young woman with hair as vivid as fresh blood, contrasting sharply with her dull gray-green sweatshirt. Her posture is hunched, her gaze fixed unwaveringly on the Abyss before her. There's a stillness about her that goes beyond mere physical immobility – as if her very spirit has been caught in the Abyss's gravitational pull.
