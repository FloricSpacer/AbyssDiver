Hey, you're here to explore the Abyss, right? I'm sure you are; just about everyone who visits Outset Town dives down to explore it sooner or later. Our town is built around the outer edge of the Abyss, an enormous hole in the earth. Nobody can even begin to guess how deep it is. It goes at least several kilometers down, but nobody is known to have ever reached the bottom or even gotten close, so it could be much deeper. Of course, the biggest draw bringing so many explorers to challenge its depths is the Relics, mysterious tools with abilities that can't be explained by modern science. Many of these Relics have extremely useful or powerful magical effects, so while the risk is great, it can be well worth the effort for all the divers who venture into the Abyss after them.


While traveling down into the pit is fraught with danger in the form of beasts, traps, and unforgiving environments, it's getting back up to the surface that usually poses the greatest problem. A near- omnipresent Miasma pervades the Abyss, getting thicker and more potent the further down you go, and being especially concentrated around ancient and powerful Relics. Ascending to the surface through the layers of Miasma leads to divers being afflicted with Curses transformative effects than can slowly change or corrupt the body and mind. The more you explore the Abyss, the deeper you trek, the more Relics you take...the more the person you were before slips away. Some divers are completely unrecognizable when they emerge, and more than a few don't emerge at all defeated by the Abyss, consumed by greed, fearful of the effects of ascent, or sometimes simply discovering that they prefer life down there.

Because Curses can often have substantial effects on the minds and behavior of divers, there are very few accurate reports and little information available about the Abyss past the first couple of layers. Most of it is an unknown, unexplored frontier. Just remember to make sure you can live with the decisions you make down there divers that have surfaced from particularly deep dives with many Curses generally seem happy with their life, but frequently have troubles reintegrating into society on account of the changes in their appearance and behavior. There's nothing wrong with deciding you've hit your limit and choosing to end your adventure earlyâ€¦just be sure that you make that decision while you're still you.

Come with me, and I'll help you find some companions to help you on your journey!

[[Learn about the Companions|Surface 2]]


:: Surface 2 [surface]

<img @src="setup.ImagePath+'icon.png'" class="floatr">\

You can hire some companions to come with you for your dive!

They're all heavily screened, loyal, and drawn to work here by a shared lust for adventure and discovery. They will obey any commands directly related to helping you explore the Abyss, but they'll generally put their safety first in times of extreme danger - they're partners, not slaves, and they may even choose to leave you if you treat them exceptionally poorly. There's nothing stopping you from trying to forge a deeper relationship with them if you like, though. I have it on good authority that you could have a chance with any of them romantically, regardless of gender. Or you could just make some lifelong friends!

They follow the same rules as you, so unless you buy supplies for them, they're going in with just the clothes on their backs and their rucksack sleeping bags. Also, all of them are injected with a lethal, dormant poison that activates on contact with human stomach acid, to prevent cannibalism. You'd be surprised by how much of an issue it used to be!

Also, you should probably know about The Purity Gene. The "purity gene" (scientifically, PUR69E) is a unique insertion mutation rarely observed in infants born near the Abyss, here in Outset Town. This mutation confers on its bearer an immunity to the effects of Miasma, preventing them from being corrupted during their ascent, or from being locked out of the Abyss after they leave it and spend a few days on the surface. Furthermore, it even allows their bodies to use Miasma as a source of nutrition and maintain many bodily functions, so they need no food or water while in the Abyss. Being so heavily connected with the Abyss has drawbacks, however - it confers on them problems completely opposite to those of normal divers. While they can ascend through the Abyss just fine, descending through the Abyss (even through early layers) quickly causes them to lose their memory and sense of self, and invariably causes them to abandon their life on the surface and live as a beast of the Abyss, in mind if not in body. This effect is prevented if a human without the "purity gene" accompanies them while they descend. A strong, impassable repelling force also prevents them from picking up Relics that haven't yet been claimed by another diver, so they can't split up to find Relics faster or bypass their corruption costs. As they require other divers to be with them to effectively explore the Abyss, the general consensus is that they are better suited as companions to other divers, rather than solo divers themselves - and those with the "purity gene" have been strictly prohibited from traveling into the Abyss alone.

In short: they're not corrupted by the Abyss, and don't need food or water, but are only effective and useful at exploring the Abyss when they're traveling with someone else who doesn't have the gene.

All of the companions available for hire here have the "purity gene."

Each companion has some initial abilities that will help you, but over time you can get to know them more and unlock more conversations, which will happen faster if you hit it off with them. Those can tell you more about the companion themselves and also unlock additional mechanical effects as they help you on your expedition!

I'll show you around the shop then you can come back and get any companions you wanted to hire.

If you're going to be spending days, weeks, or months adventuring in a dangerous, monster-filled pit, you need to get some supplies first! Here's your stipend of 300 dubloons to get you started. We'll also supply you with a very large and a durable rucksack that should be big enough for just about anything you'll need to carry on your journey. It doubles as a thermal sleeping bag, too!

You can find valuable Relics while you're down in the Abyss, and if you like, you can sell them here and obtain additional dubloons to fund your expedition. This does require you to go through the Miasma multiple times and become more corrupted, so weigh your options carefully first. Relics change hands quickly after being sold, so you won't be able to get them back later if you get seller's remorse. Even if you're short on dubloons, I strongly recommend against any kind of thievery! This town's whole economy was built on Relics, so the businesses around here have had plenty of time to learn how to deal with people who would try to steal wares, sell forgeries, and cheat them out of coin. Many would-be criminals have come up here with the "perfect" combination of Relics for robbery, only to swiftly be brought to justice by the people of here with Relics of their own. It's not worth the risk.

The weight of everything for sale is provided in kilograms. I'm not here to push any kind of arbitrary weight limit on you that's something you need to decide. How much do you think you can sustainably carry a on a long, perilous adventure down into the depths? Remember, "the ability to lift something" and "the ability to carry it with you for the better part of your waking hours for days, weeks, or months" are two very different feats. (For reference, an average adult human will feel moderate discomfort carrying around 20kg for a long time.) (We have amazing healthcare here in Outset Town and can provide you with free state-of-the-art surgery to cure any physical disabilities, and/or a few weeks a at our gym, to bring you to average human levels. I strongly believe that anyone can be a diver, if they put their heart into it.)

Apart from the things you buy here and the clothes on your back, we can't let you bring anything else into the Abyss. Most tools made from outside materials quickly decay and become useless when brought into the Abyss, anyways.

Now there's only a little more to tell you before you can spend those free 300 dubloons we're giving you! This is the habitation option for our current layer, which is the Surface.

You'll find Habitation options just like this one on every layer of the Abyss. These represent possible endings to your journey, giving you an idea of what happens after you decide to settle down. You might end up choosing one of the options down in the Abyss due to finding that you don't have enough supplies to make it back to the surface, or because you don't want to take on more Curses to be able to ascend through the Miasma - or perhaps you'll simply fall in love with one of the of layers down there and never want to leave. It happens sometimes, but not very often in the deeper layers.

After picking a Habitation option, your fate will be locked, sealing you permanently in the layer you choose and foiling future attempts to change your mind and leave. This also applies if you spend over <b>two consecutive days </b>on the surface after having previously been down in the Abyss - the Miasma will adapt and grow to reject your body, preventing you from entering the Abyss once more and forcing you into the surface's Habitation option. Furthermore, Habitation options are all locked away by fate until you choose them - you can't actually interact with any Habitation options or potentially make use of them on your quest prior to choosing them and settling down. <i>You cannot choose a Habitation option when your corruption points are lower than 0.</i>

What your companions do after you pick a Habitation option will largely depend on their temperament, and how well you've treated them on your adventure. Did you woo them and steal their heart, making them want to spend the rest of their days with you? Or did you merely treat them as tools, exploiting them for gain? Some characters, like Cloud, have a vested interest in the surface and would need a great deal more convincing to stay down in the Abyss permanently... while, for example, Cherry would be bit of a challenge to convince to live anywhere, let alone return to her life on the surface. Keep things like that in mind when thinking about how your ending will go. If necessary, companions may attempt to return to the surface on their own if you decide to stay down there the return trip is less perilous for them than it is for you, after all.

Now I think you can have a look around the town and choose how to spend your dubloons!

As you walk around town, you notice a woman with hot pink hair and enormous breasts trying to haggle the price of a Relic up. She holds a relatively mundane cup up towards the merchant in apparent exasperation, but he seems unfazed and simply shrugs his shoulders. After a moment of waiting, she sighs and hands him the cup, receiving a small amount of dubloons in return, seemingly unsuccessful in her bargaining attempt.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 2>>
As you make your way to your destination, you notice an especialy burly man with a fluffy dog tail behind him and floppy dog ears on top of his head crying quite loudly by the side of the street. He seems to be hugging a more average-looking man, who in turn seems to be trying to comfort him. The large dog-man gestures to his crotch (where you notice a sizable bulge), and the smaller man winces, but hugs him tighter attempting to reassure him once again before they walk into the local inn together, holding hands.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 3>>
Near the entrance to the Abyss, you notice a woman offering something to divers who are about to venture downwards. Taking a closer look, you can see that she's offering basic supplies with fancy labels at a significant markup from the shop prices! You can get "Abyss-proven" water or "Miasma-resistant" food for double the cost. And while most divers seem to be ignoring her, a few hesitate to hear her sales pitch and a few more of those end up buying the overpriced supplies.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 4>>
An apparently quite young boy, seemingly barely even a teenager, seems to be getting into a fight with a very scantily-clad woman in front of a non-descript building with a few similarly-dressed women inside watching. At first the words are indistinct, but then the boy gets louder as he tries to offer money and is refused for obvious reasons. He tries to give some justification and offer the money again, but the woman calls a large man in an imposing security uniform who escorts him away from the premises. The boy complains, but ultimately walks away disappointed.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 5>>
A quiet black-haired young woman, who you seem to remember from the companion area, seems to be sitting on a bench in the middle of town with a notebook in her lap. She seems to be writing vigorously whenever an abnormal looking person walk by, but becomes still when no one atypical is in sight. When she notices you looking at her, she meets your eyes for a moment, but then goes back to her previous behavior of intermittent rapid scrawls when someone interesting happens by the town center.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 6>>
As you walk through town, you spot a gentle-looking young man with ruffled brown hair and striking green eyes trading some standard items to a pair of prospective divers. As he finishes the transaction he glances over at you and his eyes widen for a split second, but then he returns to his neutral smiling face and continues on his way. Why did you bother to sit around and watch some random person in the background anyway? You've got to get back to your own adventure!<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 7>>
A large, hulking machine stands motionless near the entrance to the Abyss. You observe it for a few seconds, and spot some mechanisms of unknown purpose spinning and whirring around it. Curiously, it has a symbol resembling a baby spray painted onto its side, although you can't tell exactly what it's doing. Its attention seem entirely focused on the Abyss.<br><br>

:: Surface Summary [surface]

[img[setup.ImagePath+'icon.png']]

Looks like you're ready to start your voyage! Let me just summarize and make some quick notes:

You have four major stats you should keep track of - corruption, gained from Curses and spent obtaining Relics or whenever you ascend a page, days of food and days of water, which you should be consuming 1 point each of daily or things will get really bad, and dubloons, which you can spend on this page. (You can obtain more by surfacing with Relics and selling unwanted ones.) Weights are provided so that you don't break your back lifting completely unrealistic load, but you'll need to set your limits there. The only one that can logically become negative is corruption, but I'd use caution and try to keep it balanced when possible reckless choices may leave you with a deficit that you can't balance out, and you can't choose a Habitation option and end your adventure with corruption points lower than 0. Other than the free stipend of 300 dubloons that you got, all stats start at 0.

Though it heavily references it and shares a name with it, this isn't quite the same Abyss that you might be familiar with from certain work of fiction. You won't cry blood when ascending, and while death's certainly still possible, sexual misadventures are more likely. Prior knowledge of that Abyss and universe isn't necessary to enjoy this adventure at all.

You'll have my voice down there explaining your available options, but I won't be physically accompanying you. If you like, you can think of it as manifestation of your own intuition, or as the voice of the Abyss itself, or both.

[[Return to town|Surface Hub]]

You stand at the foot of the Abyss, a hole large enough to defy the imagination. A light, cold wind tickles your face &mdash; not a familiar northerly wind, not a zephyr, not any kind of wind you've experienced before &mdash;  no, this wind beckons you from below, from deep within the earth. The greedy maw of the Abyss patiently awaits your descent. The only way forward is downward.

It won't take too long to make your way down to the Abyss proper &mdash; there's no cost in moving down to the next layer. Just be sure you're ready, getting back is the hard part.

	Stepping into the shop, you're immediately greeted by a spectacle of Relics, in varying stages of packaging, ready to be shipped off to unknown buyers across the globe.

	The proprietor, a man busy sealing a vintage vacuum cleaner into a metal crate labelled "Fire Hazard; DO NOT DISTURB," glances your way, sizing you up in a brief moment. His nonchalant demeanor indicates he doesn't find you particularly interesting or a potential buyer. 

	<<say $relicBuyer>>If the Abyss happens to lure you in, do visit again. I'd be delighted to buy any Relics you're willing to part with - for a fair price, naturally.<</say>>
	He points to a peculiar handheld meter perched on the counter. As he moves it near a Relic, it begins to tick, a mechanism he uses to calculate a "fair" price, given that divers have nowhere else to sell unless they complete their dive.
<<else>>\
	<<if $app.inhuman < 2>>
		As you step into the shop, you witness an array of Relics being prepped for shipment to curious buyers across the globe. The merchant, noticing your entrance, stops his work to offer you a warm welcome.

		<<say $relicBuyer>>Hello, diver. Would you like to offload a few of those Relics? Do bring them over, and I'll gauge their worth using this device.<</say>>
		He indicates a peculiar handheld meter resting on the counter. When brought near a Relic, it ticks, helping him determine its "fair" price, well aware that divers can't sell elsewhere unless they've finished their dive.
	<<elseif $app.inhuman < 6>>
		As you step into the shop, you witness an array of Relics being prepped for shipment to curious buyers across the globe. The merchant's eyes flicker with anticipation as he momentarily pauses his work to assess you.

		<<say $relicBuyer>>Greetings, <<sirmaam>>. Fancy unburdening yourself of some Relics? Bring them over, and I'll appraise their value. It may be worth your while to leave a few here to acquire valuable supplies for your dive.<</say>>
		The merchant excitedly points to an unusual handheld meter on the counter. It ticks when brought near a Relic, a clever system to calculate a "fair" price, recognizing that divers can't sell elsewhere unless they've finished their dive.
	<<elseif $app.inhuman < 10>>
		As you step into the shop, you witness an array of Relics being prepped for shipment to curious buyers across the globe. The merchant, eyes gleaming with unmasked greed, pauses his work to scrutinize you. 

		<<say $relicBuyer>>Greetings, <<sirmaam>>. Care to unload a few of those Relics? Please bring them over, and I'll appraise their value. It may be worth your while to leave a few here to acquire valuable supplies for your dive.<</say>>
		With visible eagerness, he gestures to a peculiar handheld meter stationed on the counter. It emits a ticking noise when it nears a Relic, serving as a strategic tool to work out a "fair" price, recognizing that divers can't sell elsewhere unless they've finished their dive.
	<<else>>
		As you step into the shop, you witness an array of Relics being prepped for shipment to curious buyers across the globe. The merchant pauses his work to evaluate you, eyes shimmering with restrained greed tempered by his unease at your inhuman appearance. While he expects profitable transactions from you, his discomfort is hard to hide.

		<<say $relicBuyer>>Hello... <<sirmaam>>. Would you like me to... acquire a few of those Relics? Please bring them here, and I'll appraise their value.<</say>>

Due to your significant haul of loot from the Abyss, you live a rich and comfortable life after your journey. You become somewhat of a legend in Outset Town, and people started coming to you for advice when going on their own abyss dives.

Due to your well-known lucrative expedition with so few side effects, you wrote and marketed a very successful book titled "Finding the Gold in the Darkness, a Guide to Abyssal Success by $app.name". The book became a smashing success, adding to your already comfortable bank account.

Of course not everyone who bought it was as successful as you in the Abyss, and not all of them came back rich or with the same form they went in with, but no one can blame you for that. Your healthy book sales continue throughout your life, ensuring your wealth after the expedition never fades and you have a comfortable living situation for as long as you desire.

You manage to come back from the abyss relatively unscathed by the corruption of the miasma, but unfortunately also without an enormous haul of loot.

You sank a small fortune into your expedition (even if it was gifted to you) and you have little to show for it in the end. Maybe Abyss diving wasn't quite for you in the end?

You head back to your home and essentially pick up life where it was left off $time days ago. While it seems like not much has changed, your time and experiences in the Abyss will always stay with you and the memories of your expedition will stay with you for the rest of your life.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Habitation/surfacehabitation.png']]

You manage to come back from the abyss relatively unscathed, but with quite a haul of loot you can use to build a small fortune.

However, you did lose a significant amount of years. But that's a small price to pay for your newly acquired wealth, and in a few years you'll be back to your adult self anyway, right? It's not like it was some sort of permanent change to yourself.

The reality turned out to be a good bit more troublesome. Because of your age people had a hard time believing you were actually the successful diver they'd heard about. When you tried to sell advice to enterprising divers, you found that they weren't interested in listening to you, despite your mostly successful experience. Either they thought you were a fraudulent child or your age reduction proved the failure of your voyage.

In the end, you had trouble because of your age in nearly every aspect of your life. When going to parties you were shooed away unless someone vouched for you. When buying a new house the seller wouldn't accept your money without the presence of an adult, for fear of illegally making a contract with a child. Of course any sort of love life needed to be put on hold, as no one you would want to be with would accept a relationship with someone who appeared to be a little <<PerceivedGender $app>>. Even the simple inability to get a driver's license brought you nearly endless headaches when trying to travel somewhere without public transport (and ride sharing services didn't take children due to legal liabilities.)

In the end, you had to spend a considerable amount of your fortune to hire a legal guardian to take care of the many issues that seemed to pop up in the years while you grew up a second time. The woman you hired was pretty helpful and loyal, presumably because you payed her so well, but you were still happy to see her go after you turned 18 again.

Once you reached your second adulthood, you could finally enjoy the small amount that was left of diving treasure and the respect that was deserved of a successful diver such as yourself.

When you come back you seem to not only have much of your age melted away, but also without much of a haul of valuable loot. Although people were generally accepting towards you, there were a number of problems that popped up due to your new age, which you unfortunately didn't have the dubloons to resolve smoothly.

People already had a hard time believing you were a diver, even if they knew some divers did come back younger. But you also had trouble with finding an apartment that would allow you to sign the lease and would fit into your budget. When you thought you had found an affordable apartment, they refused to let you sign a lease because "you were just a kid" and thus not able to legally sign the contract. Apparently the laws made to help former divers with reduced age mean nothing if people don't believe you aren't just some random kid.

After a while, many people simply viewed you as a homeless kid with a wild imagination, and you were forcibly assigned a legal guardian by the city. Your assigned gaurdian was strict and treated you as the child they believed you to be, completel with early bedtimes and a return to school.

Luckily, this was only a temporary state of affairs and eventually you did reach the age of 18 once again, leading to your complete legal freedom. Now that you were an adult again, you had a whole new adventure to embark on, the rest of your life.

While not everybody was intolerant, you felt that in many ways you were shunned by many parts of the local community, even around Outset Town. The main people you felt some kinship with was fellow divers who had also been Curses by the corruptive miasma of the Abyss.

Of course it was even worse if you traveled farther from the Abyss, so you tended to keep nearby to avoid being branded a "demon" or "devil-worshiper" by people who didn't understand you. And while Outset Town did have laws to prevent discrimination against corrupted divers, they were rarely enforced. And many people feared that you might be some sort of sex-maniac who was unable to control your urges around people, despite not having any problems of the sort occur when you were on the surface.

After a while, you felt that you could put your riches to better use by starting an organization where former divers with more serious Curses could congregate, while also promoting awareness and tolerance for Cursed divers around Outset Town.

In the end, your efforts did help somewhat, and there was far less open fear of divers who were touched by the Abyss, but you still felt more at ease in your mansion on the outskirts of town.

Your lack of funds meant that you immediately needed to find an apartment nearby, in Outset Town, but it seemed that as soon as people saw you, apartments were already sold. You might talk to someone on the phone, get a price, arrive for a tour, then get told the unit was sold and no longer available. You heard rumblings about some divers apparently being difficult clients to deal with, and despite the fact you never caused a problem, it seems that was projected onto you too.

Finding a job wasn't much easier, unfortunately. In the end, and ex-diver named Harry employed you in his store and you shared an apartment with him. He had green, slimey skin, but he was a kind man that was always fair in his treatment of you.

You now spend your days working in the store or participating in movements for fairer treatment of people with visibly inhuman afflictions.

Eventually, Sheela, a nice lady with a pair of fox ears and an orange fox tail, took pity on you and aided you. You put your hard-earned wealth to work and together you set up a shelter for other divers who came back with severe age regression, similar to your own.

While you funded the whole organization, Sheela managed the day-to-day affairs with the apparent children in the shelter. Sometimes it was nice to enjoy the fruits of your labor and spend some time relaxing in the shelter yourself, pretending you weren't the owner and you could just relax. And of course, getting soft pats from Sheela was always nice as well.

Upon your return from the Abyss, you were a changed person, though some may not consider you to be as much of a person as you were before. And of course, you had lost much of your age on the journey.

After living with Sheela for a while, you began to feel guilty for taking so much from her, without being able to give her enough in return. When you told her your thoughts, tears began to flow down her face. She explained that her foxy ears and tail were not the only side-effects of her time as a diver, she had also been Cursed with absolute infertility. In her younger years it hadn't mattered as much to her, but by now she had yearned for children of her own, and taking care of you had brought her great joy in life. For years she had regretted her expedition, the meager earnings not worth the cost she paid, but now she was content with her life, accepting what had happened and accepting how her life had eventually turned out.

Despite being an adult on the inside, you had formed a deep bond as she protected you from a world that viewed you as a child, and when she revealed her true feelings you couldn't help but hug her tightly. Many tears were shed on both sides that night.

From that point on, you felt like you had formed a nice, though odd, family connection with her. Eventually you grew up, but you kept a strong connection with her for the rest of your life.

You return to Outset Town with a substantial pile of dubloons, giving you great financial freedom in your endeavors there. You also become somewhat of a legend amongst divers due to tales of your success.

However, you also developed an almost unquenchable thirst for sex due to the corruptive influence of the Abyss in your life. At first you began throwing exorbitant parties at you new estate. In many ways, your money made you feel like Gatsby himself.

However, over time you build up an infamous reputation among the people of Outset Town due to your focus on sex above almost all other things in life. The police show up due to public disturbances during a few of your parties, killing the typical debaucherous mood.

Eventually, you used the rest of your fortune to found an exotic brothel in Outset Town, where you hired many former divers wth mutations and particularly high libidos or sexual compulsions. You also found that many wealthy divers with Curses felt more at home near Outset Town and were drawn to an outlet for their sexual frustrations, creating a great business opportunity for you.

While managing the brothel was certainly not always easy, it never ceased to be enjoyable for you. You would sometimes invite your willing personnel over for a personal "inspection" by the owner, and there were some days where you enjoyed entertaining the eager customers yourself. You remained a very hands-on owner for the rest of your days.

Unfortunately. you returned to Outset Town largely empty-handed. And your dive was well known among the people of the town, however, you had developed an almost unquenchable thirst for sex.

At first people reacted positively to you when you told them about your adventures, but the constant sexual innuendos, inappropriate public conduct, and your generally sex-orientated behavior quickly built an infamous reputation amongst the people of Outset Town.

Drifting from job to job, you tried to make money, but whether it was sleeping with your boss or public masturbation, in the end your high libido always caused you to be fired.

Eventually, you became so strapped for cash that you started offering your body at parties you had infiltrated, and then also on the street. After all, why not get a little something back while also satisfying yourself? You wanted sex, some people wanted you, and you could make everyone happy.

Of course you considered doing other things, but really, you had a good life when you thought about it. Despite the risks of being a prostitute, your brothel actually treated you well and you definitely enjoyed your job. There was really no reason to complain. You weren't rich, but you made enough money and had fun doing it, and that's what really matters, right?

You return to Outset Town with a substantial pile of dubloons, giving you great financial freedom in your endeavors there. You also become somewhat of a legend amongst divers due to tales of your success, but people tend to be surprised when they see you and perceive you to be only a child. Some people who aren't intimately familiar with the changes the Abyss causes in people even believe that you are merely telling tales and simply inherited your wealth.

Due to your perceived age, you occasionally have trouble with spending your wealth, especially on things that people think only adults should be buying, like a house. However, the larger difficulty was the fact that you had a great desire for sex due to the Abyss's corruption, but your appearance as a child made it very difficult to find people to indulge you.

You hired a faux legal guardian to purchase a house for you, but you continually bickered with her due to your focus on sex and her treatment of you as child rather than a true equal. She was very helpful in your everyday as she drove you around and handled many legal issues, yet you still found yourself in conflict with her many times and had to pay her a sizable salary just to prevent her from quitting.

Eventually, you signed some papers that you probably should have read more closely and gave her control over your funds until you once again reached the apparent age of 18. This turned out to be a grave mistake, and everthing changed afterwards as she had full control of your estate.

Two years after that event, you spend most of your time effectively imprisoned within your own home. Your guardian greatly abused her power to control you, by placing mittens on you to prevent you from touching yourself and keeping you within a padded room styled to look like one for a small child. You are gagged with a pacifier to stop complaints, and she would not listen if she could hear you. And your "guardian" lives a life of luxury spending your hard-earned money.

When you returned to Outset Town you had lost much and and gained little in return. But upon living in the surface again, you realized you could still lose more if society rejected you. It was already difficult to get by with so little cash, but you also looked like a child to any observers while also feeling like an uncontrollable sexual deviant within.

After just a few days, you found yourself in a hard, cold cell after you were caught sneaking into a nightclub that had refused you entry. You were told that you were going to be send to a rehabilitation institute that specialized in people who were corrupted by the Abyss who also lacked legal guardians.

A few days later you were taken to a place that resembled a mansion that was just outside of town. Unfortunately, it was not such a kind place to help people deal with their afflictions, it was instead a cruel place where people were forced to conform so that they did not cause problems for the "normal" people.

In that facility you were degraded and forced to follow the strictest of lifestyles, with your actions heavily constrained by the nurses and guards present. They kept in purposefully child-like areas, sometimes even resembling cribs for mere infants. You regularly had meetings with doctors, though who knows if they truly had degrees, who insisted that you must be a child and must restrain yourself from any impure impulse.

However, for you and many of the other inhabitants of the rehabilitation center, you never changed. The touch of the Abyss is not so easily controlled, and your mental Curses stayed with you for the rest of your life. The doctors rejected this, and tried to force you to conform. If you complied, you received some of your privileges back, and were able to retain a shred of dignity.

Eventually, you were living a relatively normal life, assuming you were okay with being treated as a child as remaining imprisoned within the facility. Despite the fact you were treated like a child and your freedom had been taken away, life still went on. You were able to stroll through the gardens or speak to the other patients, though you were always watched by a member of the staff to ensure you didn't return to your deviant ways.

While your mind never changed, and you always yearned to once again have control over your own life, the date of your release when you turned 18 was always on the horizon. In just a few years time you would be free to engage in all the debauchery you desired and control your own life once again. Perhaps you would even try to shut down the facility if you truly desired it and worked hard towards it.

You had undergone a not only physical change, something that wasn't unnoticed by the people of Outset Town, but also a strong mental change that oriented you towards lust. A day without at least some debauchery now seemed to be a day wasted.

Despite wanting to enjoy the many parties in Outset Town, you found that you were sometimes excluded due to your inhuman appearance. There were other parties with physically Cursed divers, but they tended to be smaller and rarer, and certainly not enough to satisfy your newfound appetite.

With the wealth you had accumulated, chose to purchase your own house where you didn't mind throwing parties quite frequently. In fact, you became well known for being very open and accepting to anyone who was interested in a night of depravity within your halls.

Your reputation became solidified as someone who valued sex very highly and was willing to open your doors to some of the rowdier Cursed divers, both physically and mentally. It was sometimes a chore to corral the guests at your estate, but in the end it seemed to work out. Many Cursed divers felt a kinship towards you due to your own situation, leading to them being overrepresented at your parties, a nice outcome in your eyes.

Occasionally you faced trouble due to your appearance and lust-adled mind, causing you to wonder if there may have been a better life for someone like you in the Abyss, but upon consideration you were always satisfied with the way your life turned out.

A sudden sensation of intense pain surges through your body, making you double over. It feels as if your body has been engulfed by flames that sear each and every nerve in your skin, while a thousand needles are pushed deeper into you, all at once. Almost immediately, it becomes too much for you and you pass out.

You wake up in a corner of the Relic Workshop with the doll clutched tightly in your arms, pressed against your chest. It gives a pleasantly warm feeling, comforting you after your terrifying experience before you passed out. Somehow, as you hug the doll, you feel calm and satisfied for at least a moment. When you look down and check your skin, everything seems alright, no scars or burns anywhere. Luckily it seems that your body has not actually been torn apart, instead it was either a psychic attack of some sort or a vision of a possible future. Whatever the case, perhaps its better to not proceed with the plan to cut open the doll.

Despite your surprise, you decide to answer the doll's question.

<<say $mc>> Sometimes, I guess. It's not always easy, but the thrill of adventure more than makes up for it to me. <</say>>
<<say $creepydoll>> You know, I can feel what you feel? And what I felt was sleepyness and tired thoughts and lots of doubt. Don't lie to me. Lying is not nice. Good girls don't lie. Only BAD people lie. IF YOU LIE YOU NEED TO GET PUNISHED. I HATE LIARS! HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE THEM<</say>>
A strong, cold chill runs down your spine.

<<say $mc>>I... I'm not lying I swear! It's just that with the changes to my body I fatigue much quicker than before. I have to try harder and harder to do the same things. But I swear that I still want to discover more of the Abyss. I can't just give up and I won't! I think it's worth it and I enjoy it!<</say>>
The cold sensation dissipates and you feel a warm, soft aura coming from the doll once again.

You're a bit hesitant about going to god-forsaken corner of the Abyss to "play", so you try to weasle out of it while attempting to avoid the doll's anger.

<<say $mc>>Maybe that could be fun someday, okay?<</say>>
<<say $creepydoll>> Yay, I'm so happy! Because today is some day you know?<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Um, sorry, I didn't mean today. I meant another day...<</say>>
You feel very tired all of a sudden and your consciousness starts to slip away.

You see yourself walking around with your dolly and at some point you recognize the outskirts of Outcast Village as you seem to pass it by.

After looking around, you find yourself not in the playroom of a nice house, but in the decrepit room on the first layer where you found the creepy doll.

<<say $creepydoll>> Aww, did you have an ouchie?<</say>>

You scramble to get your clothes and hurry out of the rotten house, leaving this place and the doll far behind. Once there is some distance between you and the doll, you stop to change your clothes. But instead of grabbing your clothes, you find the doll in your hands, once again.

<<say $mc>> What?! How?! I'm pretty sure I grabbed my clothes, right?<</say>><br>
<<say $creepydoll>> Those smelly old things? Why would you need those? You look much better than this, you silly. Now we are cute twinsies. ISN'T THAT FUN?<</say>>
You want to throw the doll away, but your body simply refuses. At the moment it seems there is nothing you can do. No matter what you want to do, you can neither get rid of the doll, nor change your clothes.

As you approach a large building with stylings of marble and Roman pillars, you spot a sign declaring this to be the center of the town's administration. There seem to be a number of services that are provided here for people who need them, including managing debts and changing your legal name.

For a small fee of 10 dubloons, you can change your legal name from $app.name to whatever you wish.
[[Change your name|Surface Name]]
<<if $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Cloud")>>

:: Surface Diver Tips 1

In the midst of a bustling scene, you observe a middle-aged man engrossed in conversation with a pair of novice divers. He appears to be advising them on their packing strategy while they listen attentively, processing his words as they organize their supplies. Upon finishing with them, he pats their shoulders, throws them a reassuring smile, and strides in your direction.

<<say $tipGuy>>I see you're prepping for a dive. Mind if I share some wisdom?<</say>>
Given the inherent risks of diving, it seems like a good idea to take any guidance offered.

<<say $mc>>Sure, what kind of advice do you have?<</say>>
A subtle chuckle escapes him, accompanied by a small shake of his head.

<<say $tipGuy>>To tailor my advice, I need to understand what you're worried about. What is it that you dread encountering in the Abyss? Then I could help you with avoiding or dealing with them. So tell me, what are you afraid of finding deep down in the Abyss?<</say>>
You take a moment to reflect on his question before responding.

[[Darkness|Surface Diver Tips 2][$fear = "darkness"]]
[[Spiders|Surface Diver Tips 2][$fear = "spiders"]]
[[Wolves|Surface Diver Tips 2][$fear = "wolves"]]
[[Snakes|Surface Diver Tips 2][$fear = "snakes"]]
[[Insects|Surface Diver Tips 2][$fear = "insects"]]

:: Surface Diver Tips 2

<<if $fear == "darkness">>
<<say $tipGuy>>Ah, the darkness can indeed be intimidating. Luckily, the Abyss itself provides light in most of its layers. There is, however, a zone beyond the lush rainforest-like area where light becomes quite scarce.<</say>>
He nonchalantly gestures towards a nearby shop.

<<say $tipGuy>>Navigating these darker regions can be easier with a flashlight or smartphone, available at the shop. Torches may seem like a good option, but their single-use life-span could be insufficient for the prolonged darkness you might encounter.<</say>>
<<elseif $fear == "spiders">>
<<say $tipGuy>>Fortunately, the Abyss isn't home to any spiders that are particularly threatening. You may come across some, but they're no different than their surface-dwelling counterparts.<</say>>
He grins wryly.

<<say $tipGuy>>And I trust you can handle those, at least.<</say>>
<<elseif $fear == "wolves">>
<<say $tipGuy>>Strictly speaking, the Abyss isn't home to <i>wolves</i>. However, some creatures residing in the upper layers bear a resemblance.<</say>>
Shrugging, he conveys a sense of ease despite the potential threat.

<<say $tipGuy>>Thankfully, they pose a minor threat compared to other Abyss-dwelling creatures. Any weapon you bring should keep them at bay â€” a few strikes of a sword or gunshots should do. In case you're without a weapon, leaving some food rations behind would also divert their attention. And they likely won't bother you at all if you're in a large enough group.<</say>>
<<elseif $fear == "snakes">>
<<say $tipGuy>>While there aren't any special <i>snakes</i> in the Abyss, colossal worms have been reported deep down, in the fifth layer. These worms burrow through the sand in search of water, their sheer size making them invulnerable to any weaponry.<</say>>
Shrugging, he takes a swig from his water bottle.

<<say $tipGuy>>On the bright side, they're easily distractible. Leaving some of your water behind should attract them, allowing you to escape. Carrying a significant extra water supply is advisable if you're venturing that deep.<</say>>
<<elseif $fear == "insects">>
<<say $tipGuy>>Regrettably, the Abyss harbors a variety of bothersome insects. The first few layers house some bizarre bees and kite dragons, but they're essentially harmless.<</say>>
He involuntarily shivers, then exhales sharply before continuing.

<<say $tipGuy>>However, in the deepest explored parts, swarms of insects can delay your journey. Shelter is your best bet against them, though you'll need to spend a day's worth of supplies to wait them out. I hated those encounters. I've never been a fan of bugs.<</say>>
He looks you over and thinks for a moment.

<<say $tipGuy>>While some may try to travel through the swarm, I'd advise laying low and waiting it out.<</say>>
<</if>>

[[Ask him for any other advice he has|Surface Diver Tips 3]]

:: Surface Diver Tips 3

<<if $app.inhuman < 2 >>\
	The experienced diver waits patiently for any other questions you might have before you descend into the Abyss.

	<<say $tipGuy>>Is there anything else you wanted to ask me about?<</say>>
<<elseif $app.inhuman < 6 >>\
	The experienced diver seems to be curious if you have any other questions you might have before you return to the Abyss.

	<<say $tipGuy>>Is there anything else you wanted to ask me about? Given that you've already begun your dive, I'm sure you're already learning by experience.<</say>>
<<else>>\
	The experienced diver seems to be eyeing you cautiously, obviously wary of you due to your appearance, as if he's worried you could fly off the handle at any moment.

	<<say $tipGuy>>Is there anything else you wanted to ask me about? It seems you've had quite a bit more experience than me.<</say>>
	He hesitates for a moment before adding one more comment.

	<<say $tipGuy>>Well, if you do want a piece of advice? I'd say you should end your dive here, while you still have a hint of your humanity and your mind is still intact. I know it can be tempting to continue, but honestly, I don't think it's worth it. I suppose that might be why I ended my dive with so few side effects...<</say>>
	He seems to muse about his own situation and reminisce for a few second before returning his attention to you.

:: Surface Diver Tips 4

<<if $temp == 0>>
The veteran adventurer arches an eyebrow and cracks a knowing grin.

<<say $tipGuy>>Well, if I had the answer to that, I'd probably be the grand sage of the Abyss. Truth is, no soul has ever reached its deepest depths or, if they have, they never made the return journey. Makes it a tad tricky to say what's really down there, doesn't it?<</say>>
His hand raises, fingers splayed out to show the number five.

<<say $tipGuy>>However, I can tell you this: there are five known levels. From surface-like groves to shadowy caverns, even icy landscapes. We all know the Abyss stretches deeper, but those who've ventured past the fifth layer have never returned to tell the tale.<</say>>
A broad smile spreads across his weathered face as he sizes you up.

<<say $tipGuy>>Perhaps you'll be the pioneer to conquer the sixth layer and live to tell the tale. Or maybe you'd rather stick to a less demanding shallow dive. Or are you like those overconfident souls who delve too deep into the darkness, never to feel the sun's warmth again?<</say>>
He shrugs nonchalantly.

<<say $tipGuy>>Regardless of your choice, I recommend giving it a good, hard thought. Every adventurer's path is their own to choose.<</say>>
<<elseif $temp == 1>>
<<say $tipGuy>>Your preparedness will depend on how deep you wanto to dive and whether you plan to forage as you go.<</say>>
The grizzled adventurer holds up two fingers, forming a V.

<<say $tipGuy>>If you're well-versed in foraging, you could survive the first two layers with minimal supplies. Beyond that, however, even the most seasoned Abyssal explorers would be foolhardy to go unprepared.<</say>>
The aged diver strokes his chin thoughtfully before continuing.

<<say $tipGuy>>There have been expeditions that ventured as far as the fifth layer, lasting several months. With the right amount of supplies and a skilled guide, it's possible to survive that long. That could be a benchmark for your preparation if you want to go deep.<</say>>
He fixes you with a stern gaze and his tone grows serious.

<<say $tipGuy>>But if you're cutting it close with your supplies, don't press your luck. Overconfidence can be fatal in the Abyss. There's a fine line between bravery and foolishness. Choose wisely.<</say>>
<<elseif $temp == 2>>
The seasoned diver chuckles, shaking his head as if amused by your naÃ¯vetÃ©.

<<say $tipGuy>>The Abyss isn't exactly an idyllic vacation spot.<</say>>
He pauses, then continues with a more serious tone.

<<say $tipGuy>>There are some who have found contentment in the upper layers, but the deeper you go, the more dangerous and unpredictable it becomes. Our laws and morals don't carry much weight there, so beware.<</say>>
He takes a sip from his water bottle and lets out a deep sigh.

<<say $tipGuy>>Usually, folks who settle in the deeper layers don't have much choice. It's a last resort, a means of survival. But there are layers down there where I'd take my chances with death instead. But who knows, maybe you'd find some beauty amidst the chaos? Remember, I'm a surface man at heart.<</say>>
<<elseif $temp == 3>>
The old adventurer shrugs nonchalantly.

<<say $tipGuy>>Once you're deep into the Abyss, the only thing that really matters is whether you can find a powerful Relic to safeguard your survival. And that's a long shot, my friend.<</say>>
His gaze sweeps across the gathered divers in the town's center, their various mutations and quirks on display: odd skin colors, pointed ears, some openly propositioning passersby, others flaunting their wealth, and a few who seemed much too young to be in this line of work.

<<say $tipGuy>>Up here on the surface, things are different. How human you appear, your level of sexuality, the amount of wealth you bring back, and your apparent age all matter. If you return looking less than human, people tend to view you as an Abyssal creature, not fit for civil society. If your sexuality becomes overly pronounced, you might end up in undesirable professions. On the other hand, returning with valuable Relics could set you up for a comfortable life, despite any other challenges. If you come back looking like a kid, well, people might not take you seriously as an adventurer, making it hard to live a normal adult life.<</say>>
His attention returns to you, his eyes serious and full of wisdom.

<<say $tipGuy>>So, choose wisely when you're down there. The Abyss doesn't forgive easily and the consequences of your decisions can change the course of your life. It's not a place to take lightly.<</say>>
<<elseif $temp == 4>>
<<say $tipGuy>>Ah, here in Outset Town we've got a special Relic that's been around since my diving days. It resembles some bizarre robotic monstrosity but it's actually rather helpful.<</say>>
<<say $tipGuy>>Its purpose is to locate and rescue infants in the Abyss, using some strange sensor to keep watch. When it spots a baby, it swoops down and brings the little one safely back to town to be cared for until their parents return. It's unthinkable to leave infants in such a dangerous place!<</say>>
<<say $tipGuy>>There were attempts to figure out its workings, perhaps modify it for other tasks, but alas, none were successful. These days, we just appreciate its help and let it do its thing.<</say>>
He lifts his shoulders in a resigned shrug, indicating his lack of further insight on the matter.

	They exchange high-fives, and you decide it's best to ignore them and move on. The experience leaves you feeling slightly bewildered. You never thought you'd be catcalled. On one hand, it feels like they're mocking you, but on the other, it's because they're attracted to the body you've crafted in the Abyss.

	You spend some time musing over whether this is something you like or hate. A small giggle escapes you as you imagine telling these macho men that you were originally a guy, just to see how they'd react. Would they be surprised given your physical femininity? Or would they expect it, since they're in Outset Town? In the end, though, you just continue your journey.
