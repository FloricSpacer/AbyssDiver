!Layer 3 - Veins of Tartarus
@@As you reach the end of the second layer and the ever-present rain gradually abates, the terrain of the Abyss slowly begins to change alongside your march downward. The space between the rock formations you've been hiking down begins to shrink, the smaller rock outcroppings merging into singular masses of land. Before long, the Abyss begins to feel less like a single pit and more like many tunnels burrowing through the earth, twisting and turning into themselves to form a massive, incomprehensible cave network. Whenever you speak, your own voice echoes back to beckon you further down.

The miasma produces no light in this layer, and these dark, twisted caverns are slow to navigate without a light source, such as a torch or flashlight. If you have such a source of light, you may subtract 1 day from all the time costs on this page. Remember that if you're using torches, they will last for exactly one choice in this layer - including ascending or descending layers.

The Abyss has various bioluminescent moss, mushrooms, and so on scattered about, so exploring these caves without a source of light isn't so impossible or as much of suicide mission as exploring caves on the surface without a light source would be - though doing so would still be quite difficult down here.

	As you walk through the caverns of the third layer, you come across what initially seems to be a clear pond, a potential source of clean water! But upon further inspection, you realize that rather than water, it is a slime that is a very translucent blue color. Luckily you noticed it in time and didn't consume any, but it serves as a reminder that strange things lurk in these tunnels. You notice a small crab suspended in the slime, apparently one that didn't recognize the difference between the slime and water until it was too late. <br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 2>>
	You notice a scurrying out of the corner of your eye on one of the walls. Preparing yourself for the worst, you ready yourself for a fight against whatever you noticed, but instead you spot a few glowing, scurrying crabs, each about 5 centimeters across, using their claws to clip some fungus and consume it. The color of the crabs seems almost like the color of the light given off by the fungus. Perhaps this is a part of the ecosystem here?<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 3>>
	A few glowing crabs skitter in front of you and quickly dart into a hole in the wall. You notice what they're running from a moment after them as a small bundle of tentacles slides across the ground, reaching a long arm forward to grab one of the crabs. Once it has a hold of the crab, it seems to extend a number of tiny feeler tentacles that gently caress the crab over its entire body and over time work themselves into all of the crab's orifices. After a minute of infiltration, the tentacle blob turns around to where it came, crab in tow, and seems to be more leisurely in its pace. Something inside you feels some empathy for that crab, given your own situation in the Abyss.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 4>>
	In the distance, you spot a faint, pulsating light source that seems to call out to you. As you get closer, you realize it's a cluster of bioluminescent crystals embedded in the cave wall. The crystals emit a mesmerizing, rhythmic pattern of light, almost as if they're breathing. The sound of your footsteps is muffled by the soft, velvety moss that covers the floor of the cave, creating an eerie, serene atmosphere.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 5>>
	The sound of water dripping from the cave ceiling fills the air around you, creating an almost melodic pattern. Following the sounds, you stumble upon a small chamber filled with stalactites and stalagmites, their glistening surfaces reflecting the dim light of the bioluminescent moss. You can't help but notice that some of these formations are quite phallic in shape. The air is cool and damp, causing a slight shiver to run down your spine. You brush off the strange thoughts that come to mind and continue on your way.<br><br>

	Your steps echo as you walk through the seemingly endless, dimly-lit caves of the third layer. Occasionally a small sound comes from some direction, but you can't tell which. The light from the glowing fungus and plants on the walls seems off to you. As helpful as it is, it leaves you with a yearning to see the sun above the surface again soon.<br><br>

The Abyss is a huge place. The Relics listed in these sections are only a small peek at all the different kinds of Relics that physically exist in the Abyss. These ones simply represent all the possibilities you're fated to potentially find on your adventure. This also naturally means that there are a fair deal of them being traded around the surface right now, though at the moment they're mostly held by private individuals seeking them for collections. It's safe to assume that any world domination Relics haven't made their way into circulation yet, or you would have heard about them.

In case you were wondering, there is one straight-shot passage through this layer between layers two and four that balloons funnel into on their way up through the Abyss.

Easily-accessible foraged food isn't guaranteed from here on. Taking a gun with plenty of ammunition is advised if you wish to continue living off the land.

In the deeper parts of the layer, a cold breeze occasionally blows through the caverns, hinting at something frigid deeper below.

You have gained $temp corruption points!

As you pick up the dubloons from the scales, you notice that the luster of the scales seems to have faded. Perhaps they only had that final use left in them or perhaps they will only serve to help you one time. Regardless, you won't be using them again on this journey.

The shrine's surfaces are rough and weathered beneath your fingertips, and a chill seems to emanate from within. Together, you and your companion approach the Skewed Shrine, bound by a deepened sense of trust and camaraderie.

With your companion's hand in yours, you stand before the shrine, focusing your will on transferring the curse.

As you round a particularly tight bend in the endless caverns of this layer, you suddenly feel a wave of intense, warm energy wash over you. Your body shudders, and for a brief moment, it feels as though every inch of your skin is tingling with an electrifying sensation. Just as quickly as it arrived, the sensation vanishes, leaving you feeling lightheaded and disoriented.

As you catch your breath, you realize that something has changed within you. Your thoughts feel muddled, your resolve weakened. It's as if a veil has been cast over your mind, muffling your ability to assert yourself. With a sense of growing unease, you come to understand that you've been struck by the Curse of Submissiveness Rectification A.

As you continue to explore the Abyss, you can't shake the feeling that this newfound submissiveness will have lasting consequences on your life, both in and out of the bedroom. Your mind races, pondering how this Curse will affect your relationships and your ability to take charge in various situations.

The uncertainty leaves you feeling exposed, even more vulnerable than before. But at the same time, a strange, dark desire begins to awaken within you. The thought of being at the mercy of others, of surrendering control to someone else, is terrifying, but it also sends a shiver of excitement down your spine.

You pause for a moment, your breath hitching in your throat as you consider the implications of this new aspect of your life. A part of you longs to resist, to fight against the Curse and maintain control over your own destiny. But another part of you, a part you can't quite silence, yearns to explore the tantalizing possibilities that the Curse has opened up to you.

As the weight of the Curse settles over you like a heavy, silken shroud, you proceed on your journey through the third layer.

This may impact how your sexual encounters and conversations with your companions play out.

	The instant the Curse takes hold, you feel it. Your penis springs to full erection, and then continues to grow relentlessly. The base, the shaft, and the tip all swell larger than they've ever been before, until you're sporting a $mc.penisCor inch long dong.

	As the erection slowly fades, you find yourself shifting awkwardly, trying to find a way to accommodate your member that insists on remaining at a larger size than you're used to. The sensation of your penis brushing against your thigh stirs up a flurry of emotions. It might be a Curse, but it might also be a blessing.
<<elseif $mc.penisCor===0 && $mc.breastsCor>0>>\
	The instant the Curse takes hold, you feel it. Your nipples jut out like pencil erasers as pressure and a stretching sensation fills your breasts. Your boobs strain against your skin, more voluptuous than ever, but your skin stretches to accommodate the swelling mass within.

	Flickering sensations and a gut feeling about the Abyss' intentions leave you certain that this isn't just fat. Your milk ducts expand along with your breasts, and the intricate web of functional and nervous tissues tingles as the swelling finally subsides. You glance down at your new $mc.breastsLabel cup breasts, and the motion sends a gentle jiggle through them. You think some additional support might soon be necessary with these girls jutting out of your chest.

	Your body pulsates with tension as the Curse grips you. Your penis springs to full erection, and then just keeps growing. Simultaneously, your nipples jut out like pencil erasers as pressure and a stretching sensation fills your breasts. The base, the shaft, and the tip of your penis continue to swell until you're sporting a $mc.penisCor inch long dong. Your boobs strain against your skin, more voluptuous than ever, but your skin stretches to accommodate the growing mass within.

	You swear you can feel your milk ducts expanding with your breasts, and as the swelling finally subsides, you can look down at your new $mc.breastsLabel cup breasts. As the moment passes and you start to become accustomed to your transformed body, you're certain that for a while you'll be distracted by the additional mass swinging between your legs and the extra jiggle on your chest.

Navigating the complex network of tunnels in the Abyss's third layer, you suddenly find yourself gripped by an inexplicable urge. A tingling sensation spreads throughout your body, centering on your most intimate areas. Your breathing becomes heavy, and you can feel your heart pounding in your chest.

An overwhelming desire to remove your underwear and socks consumes you. You pause, disoriented by the intensity of the feeling, before hurriedly stripping off your undergarments, leaving them behind on the damp cave floor. As you stand there, exposed beneath your main outfit, the sensation subsides, leaving you strangely exhilarated.

It dawns on you that you've been struck with a Curse: Clothing Restriction B. This Curse prevents you from wearing any underwear or socks, instilling an extreme mental aversion to these garments. You wonder how this will impact your future expeditions, your relationships, and your day-to-day life. The thought of being so exposed and vulnerable to the elements sends a shiver down your spine, a mix of fear and excitement.

Determined to continue your journey through the Abyss, you press forward, acutely aware of your newfound lack of underwear underneath your clothes.

As you navigate the shadows, a sudden, intense energy envelops you – it feels like an electric charge, igniting your nerves and setting your senses ablaze. You stop in your tracks, feeling the sensation course through your body, every muscle tensing with anticipation.

The Power Dom Curse has taken hold of you, and you can feel its effects immediately. Your thoughts are swirling with newfound authority and confidence, an intoxicating mixture of lust and determination. You're acutely aware of the changes taking place within you – mentally, emotionally, and physically – and you can't help but wonder how this newfound dominance will shape your life.

As the Curse takes hold, you feel your entire demeanor shift. You stand taller, more assertive, and your eyes burn with a fierce, commanding intensity. Your once-quiet footsteps become more purposeful, the echoes of your stride resonating through the caverns like a primal drumbeat. Your voice, when you speak, seems deeper, richer, and laced with a newfound authority that commands attention.

The sensation of power courses through your veins like an aphrodisiac, flooding your senses and leaving you aching for control. The desire to dominate pulses within you, an insatiable hunger that demands satisfaction. You're suddenly aware of a burning need to take the lead, to assert your will, and to conquer whatever obstacles stand in your way – both in the Abyss and beyond.

This may impact how your sexual encounters and conversations with your companions play out.

The miasma hangs heavy in the air, and you can't help but feel a sense of foreboding as you venture further into the depths. Suddenly, an unnerving sensation washes over you, as if a dark presence has set its sights on you. Before you can even react, you're struck by an invisible force of miasma.

The Curse instantly takes hold, your eyes searing with pain as your vision blurs and distorts. It feels as if someone has poured acid into your eyes, eating away at your once-perfect vision. Fortunately, there isn't the same physical damage that would be caused by any sort of physical injury. Your head throbs as your eyes struggle to adjust, and you're left feeling vulnerable and disoriented.

Despite the darkness, your eyes now feel incredibly sensitive to the sparse light emanating from the bioluminescent moss and mushrooms dotting the cavern walls. The dim light exacerbates your already poor vision, making it almost impossible to make your way through the tunnels.

Suddenly, a pair of glasses materializes before you – the Curse's twisted offering to aid you in your journey. As you hesitantly put them on, you notice that they're not only unstylish, but also seem oddly out of place in this otherworldly setting. Nevertheless, they provide some relief, allowing you to see just well enough to continue your journey.

The thought of a lifetime wearing these cumbersome glasses and struggling with contacts even after you finish your expedition is disheartening, to say the least.

You feel a shiver run down your spine, an inexplicable sensation of foreboding that leaves you uneasy. It's as if the air around you has become charged, and you can't shake the feeling that something is about to happen. Your heart races as you cautiously inch forward, every step sending a tremor of dread through your body.

Suddenly, a feeling of dreadful lightness washes through you, leaving you disoriented and dizzy. But then, the feeling recedes as quickly as it came, leaving you gasping for air, your body drenched in a cold sweat. The mental intrusion, however, persists. The presence in your mind tugs at your very essence, altering the perception of the world around you, and your place within it.

As you slowly rise to your feet, you find that the very fabric of your being has been altered. It seems that everything you do, once filled with determination and purpose, now seem plagued with an insidious levity. People around you seem almost compelled to make light of even the most dire situations, as if everything has become a cosmic joke, and you, the punchline.

You can't help but wonder how this newfound Curse, this Comic Relief, will affect your future. Will anyone ever take you seriously again? Will your once-confident presence be reduced to the status of a bumbling fool, or a lascivious oddity? As you ponder the implications, you can't help but feel a twinge of fear - but even that fear is laced with an irrepressible mirth.

With each step you take deeper into the Abyss, the Curse's grip on you grows stronger. The once oppressive darkness and chilling echoes now seem oddly amusing, and you almost find yourself chuckling at the absurdity of your situation. Yet, beneath the laughter lies a gnawing doubt - will you ever be able to regain a fraction of the respect and esteem you once held, or is your fate forever sealed as the eternal butt of the joke?

Suddenly, a wave of miasma seems to wash over you and pass through your body. As you regain your composure, an eerie sensation creeps over you, like a shiver down your spine. Your heart races, and your palms grow clammy with sweat as an unknown force suddenly engulfs you.

You don't understand what's happening, but you feel as if your very essence is being torn apart and reshaped. Your thoughts and desires shift and warp, leaving you disoriented and breathless. The sensation is both terrifying and strangely arousing.

Slowly, your mind clears, and you realize the full extent of the Equal Opportunity Curse. Your sexuality has been altered, and the concept of gendered attraction has lost all meaning to you. Attraction is now solely based on individuality and personality, with many physical traits you previously valued falling to the wayside.

As you stand there, reeling from this sudden change, you can't help but ponder how this will affect your life going forward. Relationships, both romantic and otherwise, will take on an entirely new dynamic. Will you find love in the most unexpected places? Will you form deeper connections with others, unfettered by the societal expectations surrounding gender and attraction?

You shake your head, forcing yourself to focus on the task at hand: continuing your perilous descent into the Abyss. Despite the newfound weight of the Equal Opportunity Curse, you can't help but feel a strange sense of freedom. Life has taken a new direction, and you are eager to see where this path will lead you.

As you wander through the caverns, suddenly, deep within your <<if $mc.sex === "male">>groin<<else>>abdomen<</if>>, an intense warmth burgeons, spreading outward like molten lava seeping through cracks. It's a strange sensation, foreign yet not unwelcome, discomforting yet empowering.

You clutch your belly, feeling the unusual warmth intensify. You could only describe it as an inferno of <<if $mc.sex === "male">>virility<<else>>fertility<</if>>, a flame fueled by the mysterious energies of the Abyss, a potent force waiting to give life.

An array of thoughts tumble in your mind, each carrying a weight of realization, a shard of acceptance. You are now absolutely fertile, no barrier can impede the rush of life waiting to claim form. The words echo in your mind like a mantra, carving their truth into your psyche.

How will this shape your journey? The complexity of your interactions magnifies, the simplicity of physical relations unraveling into a tangled weave of potential life. As the implications dawn on you, your breath hitches, your heart pounding a desperate rhythm against your chest.

<<set _curse = new AbsoluteBirthControl()>>\
<<set $mc.addCurse(_curse)>><<set $corruption += _curse.corr>>\
[img[setup.ImagePath + _curse.pic]]

The rocks underfoot are rough, the moss slick and damp. Alien fungi illuminate the path with a cold, ethereal light, their spores dancing in the air like a rain of falling stars. The atmosphere is thick, a heady mix of damp earth and the musty, sweet aroma of exotic fungi. Despite the absolute darkness that looms ahead, the Abyss feels strangely alive, a world humming with unseen energy.

You pause, noticing an odd sensation, a sudden chill that sends a shiver up your spine. An unsettling tingling creeps across your skin. The sensation starts from the nape of your neck and slithers down, enveloping your entire body, before concentrating itself at your <<if $mc.sex === "male">>groin<<else>>lower abdomen<</if>>.

The chill intensifies into an icy grip, momentarily stealing your breath away. The sensation is otherworldly, akin to diving into a freezing lake, the icy waters enveloping you entirely, sucking the heat from your body.

You gasp, doubling over as your body fights to comprehend this sudden change. A feeling akin to pins and needles, amplified a hundredfold, stabs at your <<if $mc.sex === "male">>groin<<else>>abdomen<</if>>, a gentle throb before it blossoms into a crescendo. You sink to your knees, clutching your stomach.

After what feels like an eternity, the sensations recede. A numbing calmness replaces the tormenting chill, a warmth radiating from within you, spreading outwards, mending the aftermath of the storm. You stand, taking a moment to regain your bearings, as you find yourself experiencing a profound, unsettling sense of loss.

You realize that the Abyss has robbed you of the ability to ever conceive a child. It’s an alien concept, something you'd never given much thought to before. Yet, now that the possibility has been taken away from you, it feels like a deep chasm has opened up within you.

The cavern around you suddenly seems a little colder, a little darker. The glow from the bioluminescent fungi appears dimmer, the spores less magical. You contemplate this new reality, the implications. Would this change the way people perceive you? Would it change your relationships, your future?

Yet, as you stand in the depths of the Abyss, a single figure in the glow of otherworldly fungi, you realize this is not the time to ponder about such things. The Abyss waits for no one. The unknown still lies ahead, and perhaps, you think, even in this haunting silence, there is a chance for rebirth.

A sudden wave of dizziness washes over you, causing your knees to buckle. An intense heat surges through your body, more alluring than any you have experienced before.

Sweat beads trickle down your forehead, dampening your neck and seeping into the collar of your ragged clothing. Each pulse echoes through your body, reverberating with a sudden and overwhelming vitality. Every muscle, every fiber of your being, resonates with a strange, newfound fertility.

Your heart pounds as you attempt to regain composure, bracing yourself against a nearby stalagmite. A peculiar sensation courses through your veins, as if your DNA is being rewritten, atom by atom. You can't shake off the feeling of inner transformation, the tangible throb of change that makes your skin prickle and your heart pound in your chest.

The possibility of procreation, the prospect of creating new life, seems to be a new reality – a primal connection linking you to every entity within the Abyss. It is no longer a matter of species difference. You are now a universal vessel, a progenitor to all possible life forms, capable of blurring the boundaries between the species.

Bioluminescent moss sparkles around you, casting a sensual glow on your flushed skin. The once intimidating Abyss now seems vibrant, alive, mirroring your own transformation. Does this lead to unspeakable horrors or beautiful marvels, you wonder?

The dark corners of the Abyss aren't so threatening anymore. They hold a new kind of mystery, a new kind of allure. Is it the Curse, or is it something within you that has awakened, something primal, something raw?

As you continue your journey, your thoughts churn. What sort of beings will you give life to? Will they take after you, or will they inherit the traits of their other parent? It's a frightening, exhilarating, and mesmerizing thought.

Pregnancy may impair you in your difficult journey through the Abyss, so be careful!

A sudden wave of nausea washes over your entire body, as if your stomach was turning inside out inside of you. You heave to vomit, but nothing comes out, instead the feeling of nausea increases.

You dry heave again, and again, but nothing comes out and the sensation only becomes more and more intense. You squeeze your fists tightly in frustration, but strangely your fingers seem to almost sink into the flesh of you palm.

The feeling of nausea wanes and you finally have a chance to examine your body for any changes. At first glance, you don't seem any different, but that only lasts for one glance, as your whole body seems more fluid, more gooey.

A few quick experiments indicate that your whole body is now made of some goo-like substance that is malleable, but always returns to your base shape if deformed. Luckily you still seem to be about as strong as you were before, but the sensation of moving is always a little different. Maybe it's because you don't have the same sort of muscles or skin or some other part of your body, but everything is just a little bit different.

Despite the drastic change, you don't have much time to ponder it as you do need to get moving once again eventually. It will certainly be a big change in your life to be a being of slime and goo rather than flesh and bone for the rest of your life.

<<set _curse = $mc.getCurse(RainbowSwirl)>>

In this layer of the Abyss, the darkness feels absolute, a tangible presence that envelops you, swallows you. However, you find respite in the occasional glimmers of light from bioluminescent moss and fungi. They paint fleeting specters of indigo and neon green on the rough cave walls, an ethereal light show in the otherwise impenetrable black.

You pause for a moment, catch your breath. That's when it happens.

It is abrupt, unexpected, a shock that echoes through your very core. Your heart thumps wildly in your chest, your senses reeling, as an unseen force falls upon you. It feels like you have stepped into an invisible current, one that has no physical source but seems to flow from the very heart of the Abyss.

Your skin prickles, your nerves firing like miniature stars beneath the surface. It starts as a mild tingle, a soft tickle, but quickly escalates into a maddening itch that races across your entire body. You gasp, a strangled sound, as the sensation intensifies. It isn't painful, exactly, but disconcerting, like a million ants crawling just beneath your skin.

Instinctively, you look at your hands. The skin is changing color, shifting, shimmering like a chameleon's scales. Your breath hitches in your throat as you watch in disbelief. Your skin is _curse.skinColor colored, an unusual sight when you look down at yourself, and it is not a subtle transformation. Your eyes, too, feel different, and when you will later check your reflection, you will see they are now _curse.eyeColor.

A shiver runs down your spine at the thought of looking so different than you did before, a mixture of dread and anticipation. But for now, all you can do is continue forward, into the depths, your body a beacon of _curse.skinColor color in the darkness.

<<set _curse = new DoublePepperoni()>>\
<<set $mc.addCurse(_curse)>><<set $corruption += _curse.corr>>\

A mysterious energy from the Abyss grips your nipples, sending shivers down your spine as tingling sensations wash over them in rhythmic waves. The intensity of the feeling grows, oscillating between the very tips of your nipples and the outer edges of your areolae. Each wave of energy extends the sensation's reach ever so slightly, transforming the surrounding skin into the pliable and sensitive texture of areolar tissue. The waves ebb and flow, leaving a subtle increase in mass at the tips of your nipples each time they recede.

The tingling sensation intensifies with each wave, engulfing your mind in a sea of unparalleled stimulation. You wonder if the Curse is creating new nerve connections or simply amplifying the signals of the existing ones, but the sensation is unlike anything you've ever experienced.

Eventually, the tingling subsides. 

Curious, you take a peek at the results. Your areolae have swollen, forming two prominent domes on your chest. Your nipples, now considerably larger, stand erect and proud at their peaks. The mere touch of a fingertip against them sends a jolt of surprise through your body, making you gasp at their heightened sensitivity. A deep certainty washes over you: these changes won't ever fade away. Your areolae will remain swollen, your nipples forever enlarged, and the intense sensations they provide will be a constant presence in your life.

The Curse's effects are more distracting than you initially anticipated.

<<set _curse = new LiteralBlushingVirgin()>>\
<<set $mc.addCurse(_curse)>><<set $corruption += _curse.corr>>\
[img[setup.ImagePath + _curse.pic]]

In this shadowy, claustrophobic environment, you notice a small alcove off to the side. The walls of this secluded space are lined with an unusually vibrant patch of the bioluminescent moss, and it seems like a good place to rest your weary body for a moment. As you settle in, you run your fingers across the soft, luminescent growth, marveling at its otherworldly beauty.

Just as you're about to relax, you feel a sudden, sharp pain in your chest, as if you've been struck by an invisible force. You gasp for air, your heart pounding, as an indescribable sensation overtakes your body and sense of lightness washes through your mind.

Your mind races with confusion and panic, but gradually, the pain subsides, and you're left with an unsettling awareness of a change deep within you. You can't quite put your finger on it, but it feels as though something fundamental to your being has been altered. As you ponder the implications of this transformation, a name surfaces in your thoughts: Literal Blushing Virgin.

The name resonates with an unexpected, sensual energy, and it becomes clear that this is the name of the Curse that has befallen you. A flood of understanding washes over you, and you suddenly realize the nature of your affliction: every time you engage in sexual activity, you'll lose all memory of your previous encounters, leaving you to believe each time is your very first.

As the realization sinks in, a mix of fear and fascination grips you. On the one hand, this Curse will render you forever inexperienced, unable to build on past encounters to become a more skilled lover. The awkwardness and uncertainty of your first time will become your eternal reality, and you can't help but wonder how this will impact your future relationships.

On the other hand, the idea of each encounter feeling like your first time holds a certain allure. The thrill of discovery, the anticipation, and the vulnerability of baring yourself to another person for the very first time hold an intoxicating appeal. There's something undeniably exciting about the prospect of reliving that electric moment again and again, even if it's born from a Curse.

A surge of warmth floods your lower abdomen, a sensation so potent it's as if the very fabric of time within you has quickened. Your mind races, thoughts blurring and melding into a cacophony of what-ifs and how-comes. Your heart pounds in your chest. The once-familiar weight of your own body shifts, a foreign heaviness settling in your womb with an almost affectionate embrace. Panic seizes you for a moment, the realization that the very essence of creation within you has been altered.

You're aware, suddenly, of the ticking clock now bound to your flesh, the consequences of a touch, a moment of surrender, could rewrite your journey here. In the silent, echoing caves, you ponder the implications.

Your thoughts drift to the future, to the transformations that await. Would the expedition cease to be about the depths of the Abyss, and instead become a chronicle of your own changes? You imagine the swell of life within, the accelerated pace of existence that thrums through you. It's a wild, unnerving prospect – to bear life in the span of mere weeks, to become an emblem of fertility beyond what any normal human could be.

As you continue onward, each step is measured, deliberate. The glow of life around you mirrors the potential glow of life within you, a reminder of the Curse – or perhaps, the gift – that you now carry.

	You continue through the dark winding caverns for days on end. After a long and monotonous journey, broken up only by evading threats that may have interrupted you, you notice that the caves are opening up. But rather than the wet forest from above, you feel the air getting colder, and occasionally notice frost on the walls of the caves.

:: Pick up the Sibyl Blend [layer3]
<<CollectRelic $relic22>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

You've been wandering these oppressive tunnels for hours, and the darkness, while not total, is becoming monotonous.

That's when you see it. A soft, verdant light, seeping through a narrow opening in the rock ahead. As you approach, the smell of fresh vegetation and damp earth reaches your nostrils. You push through the crevice, and your breath catches at the sight before you.

You've stumbled upon an underground garden, hidden away in the heart of the Abyss. An emerald glade bathed in an otherworldly light, surrounded by crystal stalactites and stalagmites that act as a natural enclosure. The source of light is a cluster of luminescent mushrooms in the center, their caps gigantic and glowing like alien suns, casting a jade light that bathes the entire area in a soothing glow.

Rows of neat tea bushes stretch before you, their leaves glistening under the light. Here, in this improbable oasis, surrounded by the oppressive darkness of the Abyss, is a tea garden.

You wander down the rows, tracing your fingers over the leaves, feeling their velvety texture. It's strange, this sense of peace and tranquillity in a place that should be nothing more than lifeless stone and darkness. Yet, it's also fitting. After all, tea is known for its calming effect, and what better place to cultivate such a plant than here, far from the tumult of the surface world?

At the heart of the garden, you notice a stone table and matching chairs, all covered in moss. Atop the table is a teapot, beautifully crafted, with a delicate design of curling vines. Beside it is a small pouch - the Sibyl Blend, you presume.

You pick it up, marveling at the weight of it. You untie the strings and the scent that wafts from the pouch is heavenly. It's a blend of earthy, floral, and fruity notes. You take a leaf and steep it in the teapot, watching as the liquid turns a beautiful amber color. The flavor is just as enchanting as the scent, and you find yourself relaxing, letting the calm of the garden seep into your soul.

You finish the tea and watch in amazement as the remaining leaves float to the side of the cup, pointing toward the exit of the cavern. You pocket the sachet, knowing it will serve you well on your journey further into the Abyss. The Sibyl Blend, the legendary tea of the Abyss, is now yours.

:: Pick up the Pangea Shaker [layer3]
<<CollectRelic $relic23>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

After what feels like hours, your eye catches a glimpse of an unusual glow, different from the typical bioluminescent life around you. The glow originates from a wide chamber up ahead. As you approach, the glow brightens, revealing a cavernous expanse filled with towering columns of crystal jutting from the ground and ceiling, casting refracted light in all directions, a kaleidoscope of colors, very much like a rainbow.

Among these colossal crystals, nestled into a formation on the cavern's far side, you spot the Relic. The Pangea Shaker, reflecting the prismatic light, appears as an ordinary salt shaker yet filled with a rainbow-colored powder that swirls with an almost hypnotic motion.

With careful steps, you navigate through the crystal forest. The shaker sits on a pedestal of pure quartz, looking deceptively simple yet promising the power to revolutionize taste. It's an oddity in this vast, isolated Abyss, suggesting perhaps the influence of some long-lost civilization or perhaps a whimsical creator god with a penchant for culinary arts.

You reach out and gingerly pick up the Pangea Shaker, feeling the strange coolness of the glass and the slight weight of the powdery contents. A thrill runs through you as you realize you've secured the relic. Its infinite flavors are now yours to command. Yet, the Abyss still calls you deeper, as if the Pangea Shaker was but a taste of the marvels and mysteries waiting below.

And so, holding the Relic firmly in hand, you continue your descent into the Abyss, guided by the echo of your steps and the glow of bioluminescent life. You wonder what flavors will be the first to try with the shaker and how it will change your experiences in the Abyss.

:: Pick up the From Seafoam [layer3]
<<CollectRelic $relic24>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

As you wander through the caverns of the third layer, a feeling of something different, something special, tugs at your curiosity. Turning a corner, you find yourself facing a wide, domed cavern. It's filled with light, its intensity rivaling that of the noonday sun. Unbelievably, the cavern is filled with water, as clear as crystal, illuminated by bioluminescent organisms. Tiny jellyfish-like creatures hover just beneath the surface, casting a soothing, sea-green glow that illuminates the cavern.

On the far side of the cavern, almost like an island, stands an isolated formation of sea stones, moss-covered and water-beaten, seemingly untouched for millennia. Around it swirl whirlpools, the water shifting and spiraling, creating a dizzying spectacle.

You notice an object perched atop the formation, barely visible through the swirling mist of water droplets that fill the air. Despite its distance, it glimmers with an uncanny familiarity - it is the Relic you seek, the From Seafoam.

Reaching the island is no easy task; the whirlpools are treacherous and unpredictable. You carefully calculate your route, meticulously observing the pattern of the whirlpools. Taking a deep breath, you plunge into the mesmerizing abyss of water, the icy chill biting at your skin. With each stroke, you feel the immense pressure of the whirlpools pulling at you, threatening to engulf you.

Your body aches and your lungs burn as you finally crawl onto the island. The object, perched atop the mossy rocks, is indeed the From Seafoam, the coveted Relic. As you pick it up, the sponge feels curiously weightless, imbued with an odd sense of life. A soothing warmth spreads from your hand, driving away the remnants of the frigid water.

You scrub your skin lightly, feeling an immediate sense of cleanliness permeate your being. A faint aroma of the sea, mingled with the sweet scent of the bioluminescent moss, fills your senses. The sponge glows, resonating with your touch, as the scent solidifies in your mind, now tied to your skin.

Basking in the newfound sensation of cleanliness and fresh scent, you take one last look at the cavern. The water is still, the whirlpools ceased. There is an air of peace and satisfaction that settles around you. With From Seafoam tucked safely away, you begin the journey back through the Abyss, ready to confront the challenges that lay ahead, secure in the knowledge that you have a piece of the ocean's serenity with you.

<b>You can use this Relic to change your scent so that people perceive you as either more masculine or more feminine.</b>

:: Pick up the Orbweaver [layer3]
<<CollectRelic $relic25>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

Your touch glides over the cold, wet surface of the rocks as you traverse the narrow pathway, the echoes of your footsteps fading in the depth of the Abyss. The eerie glow from the moss and mushrooms casts an alien luminescence on your path, their pale greens and blues seeming out of place in the otherwise desolate darkness. They grow in clusters, their light pulsating like a heartbeat. But as you head deeper, their numbers dwindle, their gentle glow replaced by an ominous darkness.

Taking out your rope, you fasten it around your waist, the familiarity of the woven fibers a small comfort as you prepare to enter the tunnel ahead. You see a vertical shaft, nearly invisible in the dark if not for the faint glimmer of the bioluminescent fungus dotting its walls, seemingly beckoning you upwards. A sense of thrill washes over you.

Entering the vertical path, you secure the rope on a sturdy outcrop, your gloves screeching against the rough surface. As you tug on the rope, testing its strength, you can't help but feel a sense of trepidation. The Abyss is known to be treacherous and unforgiving, after all.

Casting your doubts aside, you begin your ascent. The shaft is narrow and tall, the walls slick with an unknown substance. The rope offers some traction, but not much. You heave yourself upwards, inch by painstaking inch, your muscles straining with the effort.

Halfway up, you spot something unusual—a metallic gleam embedded within the rock. It's the shape of a spider, cold and unyielding. It seems out of place, nestled among the damp rocks and bioluminescent growths. Could this be the Orbweaver?

Hesitant, you extend a shaky hand, your fingertips barely brushing the metallic spider. As if responding to your touch, it ejects a glob of sticky gloop. You quickly withdraw your hand, watching in awe as the gloop hardens in mere seconds to form a small, sturdy platform.

With newfound excitement, you climb the rest of the way, using the Orbweaver's platforms as footholds. At the top of the shaft, you take a moment to catch your breath, your heart pounding in your chest. Retrieving the Orbweaver, you marvel at the bizarre tool in your hand.

With the device's help, you're able to make your way back down the shaft, the Orbweaver's sticky gloop platforms offering a safer route. The Abyss may be a terrifying place, but it's moments like these—when you discover a Relic that changes the way you explore—that make the journey worthwhile.

<b>This Relic possesses the ability to function as a substitute for a rope. Although you've already employed a rope to acquire it, at least it can be a backup in case you lose it somehow.</b>

:: Pick up the Soulseeker [layer3]
<<CollectRelic $relic26>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

After traversing the network of tunnels for what feels like an eternity, you arrive at a peculiar sight—an enormous, hanging stalactite, its surface smooth and glowing gently. This natural cathedral is steeped in silence, except for the soft dripping of water somewhere in the distance. There's a stillness to this place that feels different, as if the Abyss itself is holding its breath in anticipation.

The stalactite’s glow intensifies near its pointed end, emitting a pulsating rhythm akin to a heartbeat. As you move closer, your hands feel an unspoken tug, an echo of the magnetic pull that once led you here.

Cautiously, you extend your hands, reaching for the beacon of light at the stalactite's tip. As your fingers graze the glowing surface, a section of it gives way like melting ice. Two metallic rods emerge from the cavity—slender and surprisingly warm to the touch. A tingling sensation flows through your fingertips as you grasp them.

These are the dowsing rods — the Soulseeker.

You feel a hum emanating from the rods, a silent resonance matching the rhythm of your own heartbeat. It’s not an immediate change. It's subtle, like the soft whisper of wind rustling through leaves, or the gentle lap of waves against a distant shore. Yet, the rods stir something within you. They are not just objects, they are keys to your deepest desires, resonating with the core of your being.

:: Pick up the Tranquility Knell [layer3]
<<CollectRelic $relic27>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

The winding, serpentine tunnels echo with the sounds of your footfalls and the faint rustling of unseen organisms. Every so often, the chime of trickling water resonates through the rocky labyrinth, hinting at hidden underground waterways. The path before you dips down sharply into an inky darkness where the moss fails to illuminate.

Your sight falls upon a larger cavern, one that has an air of quiet serenity about it. The rocks around this space have worn smooth, glistening with a strange sheen in the torchlight. It's almost as if time itself has polished them. From the cavern's ceiling hangs a multitude of tiny, delicate stalactites, each one resembling a miniature bell. They tinkle gently as a soft breeze, sourced from deeper within the Abyss, wafts through the cavern.

The sight steals your breath. It's an orchestra of natural bells, their song enchanting and tranquil. The resonance, the serenity, the physical resemblance... it's a place that seems meant for the Tranquility Knell.

Carefully, you step further into the cavern. The sounds of the stalactite bells grow louder as you walk deeper. Then, your light reveals something extraordinary: a pedestal, resting in the heart of the cavern. Carved of the same smooth stone, it's shaped like a hand, holding a small hollow at its center.

In that hollow rests a bell, the golden sheen of its surface shimmering. It’s about the size of an apple, decorated with intricate engravings of ancient symbols. You carefully step up to it, the echoes of your footsteps suddenly louder than ever in the tranquil silence.

With an intake of breath, you reach out and pick up the bell. The metal is cool to the touch, its weight reassuring in your palm. The room goes silent for a moment, as if holding its breath. You ring the Tranquility Knell, and the cavern descends into near silence.

The echoes of the stalactite bells fade away, as do the sounds of your breathing and heartbeat. You ring the bell once more to end the effect, and the natural chorus fills the room again. The Relic is yours. The cavern, it seems, was a shrine to silence, a place for the Tranquility Knell to reign.

As you tuck the Relic into your pack, you know you've found a brief respite from the constant of life in the Abyss. The adventure continues, but for now, in this moment, all is tranquil.

:: Pick up the Lightning Rook [layer3]
<<CollectRelic $relic28>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

A sense of foreboding surrounds you as you head deeper into the cavernous labyrinth before you. The stone walls are now adorned with intricate, glass-like formations, their transparent surfaces reflecting the glow of the nearby flora. This new environment resonates with the very essence of your goal - Lightning Rook.

The chamber opens up, unveiling a monumental stalagmite, its transparent form somewhat reminiscent of a colossal rook. Tiny electric arcs, like imprisoned lightning, flash within its confines, illuminating the otherwise dark space in flickering hues of blue and violet.

On an outcrop at the heart of the stalagmite, you notice the telltale glint of the Relic. Suspended in the air as if by some unseen force, the Lightning Rook beckons. Its form is flawless—a perfect, glassy rook, its transparent form seeming similar to its gigantic brethren.

You reach out and clutch the Relic in your palm. Instantly, the world around you appears to elongate, time stretching out like drawn-out silver thread. It's as if you have plunged into a pool of deep, viscous molasses — every motion, every heartbeat seeming to last an eternity. The electric arcs within the gigantic stalagmite slow to a crawl.

You realize the power that now rests in your palm, the power to bend time's relentless march to your will.

<b>When this Relic is kept in close proximity, it can be used to enhance your combat prowess, notably by improving your aim and conserving ammunition. Its presence ensures each shot counts, making your encounters with threats more efficient and conserving precious ammo.</b>

:: Pick up the Acrobatic Accord [layer3]
<<CollectRelic $relic29>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

Taking a deep breath, you check your scuba gear and adjust the oxygen levels before taking the plunge into the chilly water. The tunnel is darker than the rest of the Abyss, so dark it feels almost tangible, wrapping around you like a tangible shroud. The bioluminescent moss begins to thin out, replaced by pulsing jellyfish that glow a surreal, ghostly blue. Their soft glow serves as your beacon, guiding you through the twisting maze of the underwater tunnel.

As you swim further, the water grows thicker, murkier. The walls of the tunnel narrow, the rocky outcroppings pressing in as if in warning. You steady your breath, calming the quickening pulse in your ears.

Then, a flicker of silver light up ahead catches your attention. Following it, you find yourself in a submerged chamber, the roof covered in clusters of incandescent crystals, casting a gleaming light below. At the center of the chamber, half-buried in silt, is the Acrobatic Accord.

You feel a rush of adrenaline, a thrill that echoes through the chamber and seems to set the very water vibrating. Cautiously, reverently, you extend a hand. The anklet is cold and solid. Clipping the Acrobatic Accord around your ankle, a tingling sensation spreads through your limbs, a strange fluidity entering your movements, even while submerged in water.

As you emerge from the underwater tunnel, back into the cavernous expanse of the Abyss, you can't help but marvel at the change within you. Your movements are agile, dexterous. Every step is sure, every handhold confident. You feel a new level of harmony within yourself, an accord of physical potential you hadn't known before.

:: Pick up the Managed Misfortune [layer3]
<<CollectRelic $relic30>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

Suddenly, you detect a distinct gleam, an alien radiance unlike the glow of the Abyss's flora. It pulses with a vibrant energy, a color shifting between shades of green, blue, and purple. It's coming from a cavern off the main path, an opening guarded by sharp stalactites and stalagmites. An inexplicable pull draws you towards it, as if the source of the light beckons to you.

You tread carefully, the rough edges of the cave mouth looming overhead. Inside, the walls shimmer with the same iridescence, as if painted with starlight. At the center of the cavern, nestled within a bed of luminescent mushrooms, you spot a strange sight - two brightly-colored marbles, each one pulsing with a kaleidoscopic glow. They seem to be in perfect harmony with the cavern's unusual luminescence, as if they belong here.

As you approach the Relics, you can feel a hum of power, a manifestation of the Curse containment properties they possess. With a feeling of excitement, you extend your hand towards them. They're cool to the touch, yet vibrantly alive, a tangible echo of the Abyss's enigmatic magic.

In awe, you squeeze one marble gently. An inexplicable sense of calm washes over you. This... this is the Managed Misfortune, the legendary Relic of the Abyss. Able to contain and control the Curses of the Abyss, this could be a game-changer in your exploration. Holding them, you feel a new sense of power and control over the fate that lies ahead in the Abyss.

:: Pick up the Breathless Exhale [layer3]
<<CollectRelic $relic31>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

In the distance, you hear a faint whooshing sound, like the sigh of a sleeping giant. Your heart pounds in your chest as you follow the noise. The passage narrows, forcing you to crawl on your hands and knees. Sharp stalactites and stalagmites threaten to pierce your protective gear, but you press on. The whooshing sound grows louder, rhythmic and steady, like the pulse of the Abyss itself.

Suddenly, the passage widens into a large cavern. The source of the noise becomes clear: a great vortex of air spirals in the center of the cavern, a whirlwind caught in stone. The gale sweeps through the cavern, whistling eerily as it races past rocky formations. You feel your hair and clothes whip about, drawn to the tumultuous winds.

Over the roar of the wind, you notice a faint glint from the center of the vortex. Squinting against the fierce gusts, you make out the outline of a small handheld fan, its fragile paper panels fluttering in the wind. It hovers in the vortex, suspended by the same winds it is said to command.

Without hesitation, you activate the Breathless Exhale. Waving it before you, a powerful gust of wind materializes, counteracting the vortex. The balance of the winds shift and the vortex stutters, providing a brief opening. Swift as an Abyssal falcon, you leap, extending your arm into the heart of the vortex.

Your fingers brush against the cool, lacquered handle of the fan. Grasping it, you pull it towards yourself. The vortex howls in protest, but you're quicker. As your feet touch solid ground, you hold the Breathless Exhale aloft, its paper panels rustling in the now calming winds.

The gale in the cavern slowly dies down, the vortex dissipating until nothing but a gentle breeze remains. The cavern becomes silent once more, save for the faint echoes of your triumphant laughter bouncing off the cavern walls.

<b>Harnessing the energy of this Relic, you may be able to ward off potential threats in the presence of an intense light source, like on certain layers of the Abyss. When fully charged, its protective power can aid you in dealing with threats susceptible to the power of the wind.</b>

:: Pick up the Sharing Shears [layer3]
<<CollectRelic $relic32>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

As you carefully negotiate your way through the darkened tunnels of the third layer of the Abyss, you feel a change in the air. There is a certain tangibility, a prickling sensation on your skin, hinting that you might be close to your objective.

You venture further, your surroundings growing harsher and more alien by the minute. You stumble upon an opening, a cavern that shimmers in a pale, cold light, reflecting off innumerable crystalline formations scattered across the cave walls. At the heart of the cavern is an enormous stalagmite, looking like a jagged spike carved out of pure white porcelain.

As you step closer, you notice that this stalagmite is not as solid as it seems. There are dozens of fractures running through it, like a network of veins. Your eyes follow the lines and crevices, leading you to an intersection in the middle where a pair of scissors rest, embedded within the porcelain column.

Recognizing the Relic you have been seeking, you approach the stalagmite cautiously. The scissors — the Sharing Shears — have a bone-white color that matches the surrounding porcelain. They're unusually sharp, matching the jagged aesthetics of their surroundings.

To retrieve the shears, you must solve the cavern's unique puzzle. Looking closely, you notice the fractures in the stalagmite form two halves, each with an equal mass. It's as if the cavern itself represents the function of the Sharing Shears. With a deep breath, you place your hands on the porcelain stalagmite and apply force.

An echoing crack resounds throughout the cave as the stalagmite splits cleanly in two, the halves maintaining an equilibrium. The Sharing Shears come loose, now hovering between the two separated halves. You reach out, cautiously plucking the Relic from the air, the halves of the stalagmite trembling as they adjust to the new balance.

The moment you hold the Sharing Shears, you can sense the unique weight distribution. Although the Relic is light in your hand, you can feel an unusual force, as if bearing the weight of two objects at once.

The porcelain stalagmite remains split in two, the halves still glowing with an inner light. You lightly tap one of the halves with the soft side of the shears, dispelling the link. The halves collapse onto the cavern floor, the eerie glow fading away.

:: Pick up the Rose-tinted Spectacles [layer3]
<<CollectRelic $relic33>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

As you continue down the spiraling path you're headed down, you come to a large cavern. The ceiling arches high above you, disappearing into an inky abyss. At the center of this cavern lies an unusual structure that almost urges you to explore it. It's an immense circular platform made of polished obsidian, set into the floor of the cave. A complex network of lines etched into its surface glows with the same luminescence as the moss and fungi surrounding it. Razor-sharp obsidian shards seem to move and protrude from the glowing lines in a seemingly random pattern, leaving nearly no room to move without injuring yourself.

Your instinct tells you that the Rose-tinted Spectacles are here, and you step onto a small safe area at the edge of the platform. As soon as your boots touch the polished obsidian, a strange sensation washes over you. You see echoes of yourself, phantom images moving around the platform. One is you from ten seconds ago, hesitating at the edge of the platform, while another is you from ten seconds into the future, striding confidently towards the center.

Understanding dawns on you, and with that knowledge comes a boldness. You stride toward the center of the platform, synchronizing your movement with your future echo as it moved a few second prior. 

Suddenly, it all stops. The lights on the platform dim and the shards retract. The cavern is still once more. Yet, as your eyes adjust, you spot a pair of red-tinted glasses resting on the platform where none were before. You step forward and carefully pick up the Rose-tinted Spectacles. As you place them on, you can see the past and future echoes of yourself still moving on the platform.

With a wide smile, you tuck the Relic safely into your pack, leaving the platform and the flickering echoes behind. 

<b>This Relic can be used to avoid future traps you may encounter in the Abyss.</b>

You see yourself standing in the middle of a dark, dry cavern, with a few spots of what seems to be glowing fungus on the side of the cave to give you a chance to see the shape of the stone around you. Suddenly the image shifts and you see the splendor of the Relics that are available on this layer.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 4-relics.png']]

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 4-wonders.png']]

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and Curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 4-curses.png']]

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threats that await you on the layer

Finally, the vision fades, leaving you standing once again where you were before, with only a brief sense of motion sickness as you orient yourself back to your physical body. As you look at the Gleam Dazer once again, you notice the Relic is cracked and broken.

The beast's slick, dark tentacles glisten in the dim light, their tips adorned with suction cups that seem to twitch with anticipation. Its amorphous body is both mesmerizing and repulsive, and you find yourself momentarily paralyzed by the sight of it.

As the creature draws closer, you can almost feel the cool, damp embrace of its probing tendrils. The air around you grows heavy with the scent of damp earth and something more animalistic, a musk that sends shivers down your spine.

Suddenly, you snap back to reality, and a primal instinct to survive takes over. You hastily assess your options, understanding that bullets will be of little use against this strange, amorphous foe. Instead, you weigh the risks of engaging it with your sword, knowing that the battle could leave you injured and vulnerable.

As the tentacle beast inches closer, you can almost taste the cool, slimy texture of its tendrils against your skin. The thought of it ravaging you, leaving you and your companions weak and helpless, spurs you into action. 

<<elseif $variation === 1>>\
The sight of the shapeless creature is both fascinating and repulsive, and you find yourself momentarily frozen by the nightmarish scene. As the beast gets closer, you can almost feel the cold, wet touch of its exploring tendrils on your skin. The air around you thickens, filled with the scent of damp earth and a primal musk that sends shivers down your spine and stirs something deep within you.

Your instincts for self-preservation kick in, and you shake off the entrancing effect of the beast's hypnotic movements. You realize that guns won't be effective against this strange, ever-changing foe. Considering your options, you think about drawing your sword, but the idea of engaging in close combat with the creature is terrifying. You know that a single mistake could leave you injured and vulnerable, at the mercy of this alien being.

As the lesser tentacle beast continues to approach, the thought of its cool, slimy tendrils wrapping around your body, stroking and probing your most sensitive areas, fills your mind. The conflicting feelings of fear and desire that surge through you force you to make a critical decision – one that will determine not only your fate but also that of your companions.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/lessertentaclebeast.png']]

In your rising panic, a glint of hope emerges as you remember the Effacing Asperity, the sleek can of spray hidden in your pouch. Swiftly, you draw it out, clinging to the frail hope that its properties might hinder the creature's advances.

With your hands shaking, you aim and release the Effacing Asperity's lilac mist towards the encroaching tentacles. You expect them to falter, but the creature, adept in slickened terrain, continues its relentless approach, the tentacles seeming almost eager. Your heart pounds in your chest, and you curse your own foolishness for thinking that such a simple solution could save you from a creature like this.

Suddenly, a robust tentacle coils around your ankle, toppling you onto the cold cavern floor. More follow suit, wrapping around your limbs in a tight embrace. Yet, there's an unexpected softness to their touch. Instead of the raw friction you'd expect, the lubricated tentacles slide over your skin like silk.

<<if $mc.vagina > 0 && $mc.breastsCor > 0>>\
The tentacles, emboldened, explore your body. They slip effortlessly beneath your clothes, their caresses surprisingly gentle. With the near-frictionless touch, every sensation feels amplified. They envelop your $mc.breastsLabel cup breasts, the cool tentacles contrasting with your warmth, their suckers gently pulsating. Another tendril, slick and confident, slithers daringly lower, seeking the warmth and softness of your feminine folds.

The tendril between your legs presses insistently against your vaginal entrance. Instead of the pain you'd expect from such forceful intrusion, the effects of the Effacing Asperity ensure a near frictionless, seamless glide. It penetrates deeply, retreating and thrusting again with increased vigor, each stroke smoother and stronger than the last.

Your body, though initially resistant, begins to move in sync with the tentacles. The powerful thrusting paired with the lubrication creates a rhythm that draws moans from deep within you. The tentacles seem to revel in this, their tempo increasing, driving into you with fervor.
<<elseif $mc.penisCor > 0>>\
The tentacles, emboldened, explore your body. They slip effortlessly beneath your clothes, the sensation of their touch heightened by their slickness. The cold tentacles contrast with the warmth of your skin, intensifying every sensation. A daring tendril ventures lower, brushing against your arousal before wrapping around it, exerting a gentle pressure.

The tendril around your manhood tightens slightly and begins to move in a rhythmic motion. Every glide and tug is almost frictionless due to the Effacing Asperity, making the experience strangely intoxicating. Another tendril, slick and unyielding, teases at your rear, pressing insistently against your entrance.

The tentacles, emboldened, make their claim on your body. They slip effortlessly beneath your clothes, the sensation of their touch heightened by their slickness.

Every touch upon your erogenous zones is heightened, the tentacles now possessing the uncanny ability to glide over your skin without a hint of resistance. Their cool, wet nature contrasts with your body's warmth, causing every sensation to be oddly amplified.

As they traverse and explore, there's a rhythm — an ebb and flow of pressure and release. The beastly tentacles gain a surprising elegance with the aid of the lubricant. The line between pleasure and discomfort blurs, and your body, caught in this bizarre trap, reacts with involuntary shivers and moans.
<</if>>\

Despite the forcefulness, the lubrication turns potential pain into waves of pleasure. Every inch of you is being explored, claimed, and pleasured. You find yourself lost in the sensation, the forceful yet smooth touch of the tentacles pushing you closer and closer to the edge. Your climax, when it comes, is earth-shattering. The tentacles sense it, their movements becoming even more frenzied for a few moments before eventually slowing.

Finally, after what feels like an eternity, they withdraw with a final slick slide, leaving you sprawled on the cave floor. The creature slinks back into the shadows from whence it came. Yet even in its absence, you can still feel its lingering grip on your soul: an echo of pleasure and disgust that will remain with you for days to come...

:: Layer3 Slackslime Encounter
<<set $variation = random(0,1)>>\
<<if $variation === 0>>\
	As you press onward through the dimly-lit cavern, the bioluminescent glow of the moss and mushrooms casting an otherworldly light, you suddenly feel your foot sink into something soft and slippery. Your heart races with a mixture of surprise and dread as the unmistakable sensation of Slackslime envelops your skin. Before you can react, the organism releases its paralytic gas, permeating the air around you and seeping into your pores. Within moments, your limbs grow heavy and your body collapses, utterly powerless against the slime's paralysis.
<<elseif $variation === 1>>\
	As you continue to navigate the winding caverns, the eerie glow of the bioluminescent flora provides just enough light to guide your way. Your heart beats steadily in your chest, the adrenaline of exploring the unknown driving you deeper into the heart of the Abyss. The air is cool and damp, sending shivers down your spine as you make your way through the twisted tunnels.

	Suddenly, the ground beneath your feet gives way, and you find yourself waist-deep in a pool of viscous, gelatinous liquid. You can feel the cold, slimy substance seeping through the fabric of your clothes, adhering to your skin. Panic rises within you as you recognize the substance to be Slackslime, and its paralyzing gas rapidly fills the air. Your lungs seize, your body grows rigid, and your limbs become heavy and unresponsive.

<<set $variation = random(0,1)>>\
<<if $variation === 0>>\
	Out of nowhere, you notice a slimy tendril reaching towards you from the darkness in front of you. As it rapidly closes in on you, the fact that the only thing the tentacle is attached to is a mass of more tentacles becomes apparent, and it becomes clear what you're dealing with. It appears that you've caught the attention of a lesser tentacle beast.
<<elseif $variation === 1>>\
	Your heart races as you navigate the winding, narrow passages, your senses on high alert from the moving shadows cast by the dim illumination. The silence is suddenly interrupted by a wet, squishing noise that echoes through the chamber, making your skin crawl and the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.

	With a mix of fear and curiosity, you turn the corner and come face to face with a lesser tentacle beast. Its countless tendrils move and pulse as if driven by an insatiable hunger. The slimy, dark appendages twist and sway in the dim light, their tips decorated with trembling suction cups that seem to crave your touch.

:: Layer3 Cave Flower

<<= '<img src="' + setup.ImagePath + 'Wonders/caveflower.jpeg" class="half-size">' >>

As you explore deeper, a subtle shift in the air draws your attention. The oppressive, stagnant atmosphere begins to thin, replaced by a slightly fresher current. Intrigued, you follow the draft through a series of narrow, winding passages that force you to stoop low to avoid sharp stalactites.

Eventually, the tunnel widens into a small cavern, its floor covered with a blanket of soft, glowing moss. In the center, like a gem in the rough, you spot the elusive flower you're searching for. It stands alone, its petals faintly luminous, casting a gentle light that feels almost artificial in the surrounding darkness. The flower's glow is not bright, but it's enough to pull your eyes towards its delicate beauty.

You approach the flower cautiously, as if worried you would crush it underfoot. It's smaller than you imagined, no bigger than a thimble, and it shivers slightly at the disturbance in the air as you kneel beside it. The petal's light pulsates softly, almost like a heartbeat.

After admiring it for a moment, you carefully uproot the flower, ensuring to keep a clump of the glowing moss around its roots, hoping it will sustain the bloom until you can deliver it to Emily. 

With the flower secured, you turn back the way you came, the image of Emily’s expectant smile spurring you onward.
