!Layer 4 - Hoarfrost Wastes
@@You finally emerge from the tunnels of the third layer and are given the least warm greeting to the fourth possible: a blast of chilling air that you feel settling into your bones near-instantly. Eyes adjusting once more to the Miasmal light, your first look at the layer is of a blanket of snow extending far into the fog-covered horizon, punctuated by small glacial mountains as the ground slowly meanders downward. miasma-produced winds sometimes dislodge buildups of ice on the ceiling, causing it to drift down to the ground as snow or hail. What little vegetation there is struggling to survive in this layer grows small and sparse.

This layer is enveloped in a bitter, piercing cold, strengthened by Miasma to effectively penetrate any kind of insulating clothing or similar protection. Your only option for staying warm is an active source that radiates heat. Without somehing easily portable, like a torch, you'll need to frequently stop to take shelter to start campfires. If you have a portable heat source, you may subtract 2 days from all time costs on this page. The 5 romer stones together don't quite produce enough heat to keep you warm on their own.

:: Layer4 Spectre

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/spectreoftheend.png']]

Despite your attempts to resist the cold, an unsettling sensation takes hold, as if unseen eyes scrutinize your every move.

As you trudge through the snow, the feeling of being watched intensifies. You glance over your shoulder, desperate to catch a glimpse of your elusive pursuer. Then, out of the corner of your eye, you see her: a spectral figure, the embodiment of darkness. Her form is that of a young girl with a single, haunting red eye that never quite meets your gaze.

She stands at the edge of your peripheral vision, immaterial and seemingly harmless. Her presence, however, sends shivers down your spine. Though she never makes a sound, you can feel the weight of her gaze, the promise of both pleasure and doom lurking in the shadows.

	As you trudge through the snow, you suddenly feel a gust of wind pick up, and a flurry of snowflakes swirl around you. The miasma-enhanced cold bites at your skin, and you struggle to maintain visibility. You quickly reach for your heat source, igniting it with a flare of heat that temporarily pushes the biting cold away. The storm subsides just as quickly as it began, but you're reminded of the harsh reality of this layer of the Abyss. <br><br>

	A sudden flurry of Miasma-driven hail pelts down on you, each icy stone biting into your exposed skin. You take shelter behind a nearby glacier, watching as the hailstorm intensifies. Just as you're about to leave your hiding place, you notice a small, crystalline creature darting in and out of the hailstones, seemingly unaffected by the storm. Its delicate, ice-like body refracts the Miasma's light, creating a mesmerizing dance of colors. Once the hailstorm subsides, the creature disappears into the snowy landscape.<br><br>

The Brave Vector Relic you can find here is a perfect example of something you might want the Relic Workshop to modify on the surface. With a few simple modifications, it could work as a kind of debris gun, firing whatever rocks and rubble you can find down here at high velocity towards enemies...or perhaps even other Relics, though you would need to be quite careful to ensure that fired Relics don't break upon impact. It can also be used more generally for any Relic invention where you'd like some component to be moving really, really fast.

Between this layer and the next is a kilometers-long sheer drop with a near-featureless wall of slippery wall of rock and ice on all sides. Paths and tunnels onward to the next layer exist, but they're very slow and meandering, and taking these down to the next layer, combined with the time trekking through the main body of this layer, will take 19 days by default. If you have rope with you, you can instead descend right through this dividing space in a much shorter time, and the whole trip will only take 8 days. Remember that the return trip takes longer than the trip down, either way.

The air seems to get drier as you proceed further down. You might want to stockpile plenty of water before continuing on, probably around 2 weeks worth at a minimum.

As you wander through the fourth layer, a sudden warmth blooms from within, a soothing counterpoint to the icy realm you are immersed in. The Curse takes hold, its presence as unexpected as it is unsettling. Lactation. A personal, intimate change that seems incongruous with the harsh Abyss you navigate.

The sensation is foreign, yet not entirely uncomfortable. A gentle pressure builds within your chest, radiating a tender warmth that pulses in sync with your heartbeat. Subtle dampness permeates your insulating clothing, a stark contrast against the chill that previously dominated your senses. You look down, seeing the faint dark spots bloom against the fabric of your garments, the physical manifestation of this ethereal curse.

Panic flutters briefly in your heart. In the midst of this desolate, freezing environment, a condition like this is an unexpected twist. Yet, the more you consider it, the more you realize it isn't entirely a disadvantage. Perhaps this heat radiating from within can serve as an unexpected bulwark against the bitter cold. An aberration from the norm, no doubt, but a potential advantage in the relentless cold of the Abyss. The Abyss is a crucible of adaptability, after all.

As you continue your descent into the frost-bitten depths, you ponder your situation, a curious mixture of anticipation and apprehension. How will this affect your journey? How will you manage the necessities of this new condition, milking and all? You aren't sure. But, in the face of the Abyss, you have no choice but to adapt, to evolve.

It's a strange sensation to experience in the midst of the piercing cold and icy winds. Your mind briefly wonders if it's the effect of the Miasma, but there's something different about this fatigue, something more permanent.

You can't help but be curious about this newfound drowsiness, and you decide to pause for a moment and examine yourself. The exhaustion intensifies, your limbs growing heavy and sluggish, as if you're being pulled into the depths of sleep. You find yourself pondering how this mysterious Curse will affect your life in the Abyss.

You're struck by the realization that you'll need to sleep for 12 hours a day, a daunting prospect in this harsh environment. But then, an unexpected warmth envelops you, a soothing sensation that seems to promise safety and comfort in your slumber. You find yourself longing for that embrace, eager to experience the pleasure that comes from such deep, restful sleep.

You know that this Curse could make your journey through the Abyss more challenging, as you'll need to find a safe haven for those long hours of sleep. But at the same time, you can't help but be intrigued by the idea of such exquisite rest, especially in a place so bereft of comfort.

As night descends upon the Abyss, you prepare yourself for the restless slumber that awaits you. Despite the layers of insulating clothing you wear, the chilling cold still manages to touch your skin, but your thoughts are consumed by the anticipation of the vivid, erotic nightmares that are now part of your reality.

You finally surrender to sleep, and almost immediately, the dreams begin.

You find yourself in a dimly lit room, where the air is heavy with the intoxicating scent of lust and an underlying sense of danger. The walls seem to pulse with a rhythm that matches your heartbeat, and the space itself feels vast and infinite. Shadows dance at the edges of your vision, their movements sinuous and sensual, enticing you to follow them deeper into the darkness.

Soft, sultry whispers caress your ears, voices that are both familiar and foreign. They speak of forbidden pleasures and haunting fears, weaving a seductive web that ensnares your mind, holding you captive. The whispers grow louder, more insistent, and you feel yourself drawn irresistibly towards the shadows.

As you move closer, the shadows morph into alluring, otherworldly creatures that touch and tease your body. Their fingers, cold as ice, trace patterns on your skin, eliciting a searing heat within you that stokes an insatiable hunger.

The shadowy figures take shape, their forms shifting and changing, blending beauty with terror. Their touches are both exquisite and frightening, as they explore your body with a sense of hunger that mirrors your own.

These ethereal beings caress your most intimate areas, their ghostly fingers gliding with expert precision, leaving behind a tingling sensation that begs for more. Your senses are overwhelmed, each touch sending shivers down your spine and moans escaping your lips.

As the creatures continue their relentless seduction, you feel yourself being pushed to the edge of release. The pleasure intensifies, building to a fever pitch, until you find yourself caught between the terrifying unknown and the ecstasy of ultimate pleasure.

But just as you think you can bear no more, the creatures vanish, leaving you alone in the darkness, panting and trembling from head to toe. The room seems to expand around you, and the whispers dissipate, replaced by an unnerving silence.

You jolt awake, your body slick with sweat and your own fluids, and your heart racing in your chest. This will be what every night is like for you from now on.

	Naked and freezing in the hostile environment, you desperately search to find warmth and protection. In the distance, you spot a small, icy cave, and hurriedly make your way toward it. Inside, you discover a pile of abandoned clothing—feminine, delicate, and intricate in design. Desperation and longing well up inside you, a surprising contrast to your earlier aversion.

	You hesitantly don the frilly dress, stockings, and high-heeled boots, feeling strangely at ease in the soft, feminine fabric. Your mind starts to adjust to the changes, but uncertainty still lingers. As you look down at your new appearance, you wonder how this will alter your future interactions, relationships, and self-image.

As you traverse the desolate terrain of the fourth layer, you suddenly feel an odd sensation in your mind, as if an invisible force is wrapping around your thoughts. The sensation grows more intense, and you struggle to maintain your footing on the slippery ground. You pause, your breath coming out in misty puffs, as you attempt to comprehend this strange feeling.

Your thoughts, previously private and guarded, now feel exposed and vulnerable. It is as though a veil has been lifted, revealing your deepest secrets and emotions. A sense of dread washes over you as you realize the implications of this newfound vulnerability.

The Curse is insidious in its subtlety; there is no physical manifestation, no apparent change to your appearance. Instead, it strikes at the core of your being, leaving your thoughts and intentions open for others to perceive. With each person you encounter, you will be unable to conceal your true feelings, your desires, your fears. They will know your secrets, your lies, your hidden truths.

As you continue your exploration, you can't help but contemplate how this Curse will affect your future. Relationships will be tested, alliances may crumble, and trust will be a luxury you can no longer afford. The weight of your own honesty may become a burden too heavy to bear.

As you continue to explore the fourth layer of the Abyss, you become increasingly aware of a growing sensation in your mouth. A tingling sensation, at first subtle but steadily growing more intense, draws your focus inward. The biting cold of the miasma-charged winds whipping against your body fades into the background, as your attention is fully captured by the changes occurring within you.

The tingling sensation shifts to a throbbing ache in your gums, which slowly turns into an intense pressure. You struggle to maintain your composure as you feel your teeth shifting and changing. The pain is both discomforting and, somehow, oddly sensual. Your breathing becomes heavier, and a soft moan escapes your lips, betraying the pleasure you find amidst the pain.

As the transformation continues, you can feel your teeth growing and sharpening. The sensation of your tongue exploring these newly-formed points sends shivers down your spine, their deadly sharpness igniting a primal sense of power within you. The pain begins to subside, replaced by a newfound awareness of the dangerous tools now housed within your mouth.

Your lips part, revealing two especially large teeth, their tips just barely visible when your mouth is closed. The sight of your reflection in a nearby shard of ice is intoxicating, and you can't help but admire the wickedly seductive look these fangs bestow upon you. The perpetual smug-fang appearance suits you perfectly, adding an air of dark allure to your previously unassuming visage.

As you experiment with your newly-acquired teeth, biting down on a piece of leather from your gear, you realize the immense strength they possess. A sudden, powerful desire to use them courses through you, though you know you must be cautious not to harm any potential partners. The thought of restraining this newfound power only serves to fuel your excitement further.

<<set $playerCurses.push($curse53)>><<set $corruption += $curse53.corr>>\

Suddenly, your mouth feels unbearably full, making it difficult to breathe. Overwhelmed by the sensation, as if a foreign object is lodged in your throat, you instinctively reach for your mouth, desperate to alleviate the pressure. Upon touching it, you're struck by a mix of shock and fascination – your tongue has grown to an astonishing 30 centimeters in length.

The Lingual Leviathan Curse has taken hold.

As you grapple with your newly elongated appendage, your tongue seems to come alive, writhing and twisting in the frosty air. The sensation is both captivating and disconcerting as the cold air causes the extended muscle to tingle in a way you've never experienced before. The heaviness of your tongue feels strangely sensual as it brushes against your lips and teeth, the sensation amplified by the frigid temperature.

Taking a few cautious steps, your new tongue coils and undulates as you try to adapt to this peculiar sensation. Icy gusts envelop your face, tenderly caressing your now exposed tongue, and sending shivers down your spine. The blend of the biting cold and the warm, damp sensation of your saliva on your extended tongue evokes a primal, almost erotic response within you.

After the initial shock subsides, you become intrigued by the potential of this Curse. Your mind races with the tantalizing possibilities your new appendage could offer.

You're hiking through the snowy landscape of the fourth layer, then, abruptly, your surroundings become a blur. The bitter cold intensifies, and a wave of energy surges through you, threatening to pull you apart and knit you back together. You instinctively clamp your eyes shut, bracing against the pain, the unease, the fear. The icy winds whistling past your ears seem to fade into the background.

Suddenly, your skin erupts in a peculiar sensation, akin to a thousand tiny needles pricking every inch of your exposed skin. It's as if the marrow in your bones is on fire. Your body jerks involuntarily as the pain radiates from the inside out.

You gasp for breath, your hands instinctively clawing at your clothing, seeking the source of the discomfort. But when you glance down, your sight falls upon something unexpected.

Your skin is no longer skin. Instead, it's blanketed by rigid scales. They gleam ominously in the pale light filtering through the fog. The pattern is wild, beautifully chaotic, radiating from your core and stretching outward across your limbs.

There's a moment of awe-struck silence, but it's interrupted by a fresh wave of change. You feel the tug of follicles, hairs emerging from the scales wherever you had them before the scales grew. It's a strange sensation, a mix of discomfort and tickling that sends you into a fit of shivers.

You take a few tentative steps, flexing your newly covered arms. Each movement sends a ripple through the scales, they shimmer and dance, seemingly attuned to your every action.

You ponder your newfound form, the feel of the scales against the bitter, frosty air, and the harsh snow under your feet. Your hairs twitch with each gust of the wind, your scales bristle with a heightened sensation that you've never experienced before.

<<set $playerCurses.push($curse55)>><<set $corruption += $curse55.corr>>\
[img[setup.ImagePath + $curse55.pic]]

As you trudge onward, the Curse begins to take effect. Your back starts to itch and tingle, the sensation growing increasingly intense until it's impossible to ignore. You reach back, attempting to soothe the itch, but your fingers find something unfamiliar. Your heart races, anxiety mounting as the sensation persists.

The skin on your lower back starts to stretch, pulled taut as something begins to emerge from beneath the surface. Pain and pressure swell as a thick, reptilian tail forces its way out of your body. Unable to contain yourself, you groan as the tail finally breaks free, now fully formed and extending a few feet behind you.

The tail is large, thick, and covered in scales that feel smooth and cool to the touch. Its spiky protrusions, reminiscent of miniature mountains, run the length of the tail, culminating in a menacing, spiked tip. The tail's weight poses a new challenge to your movements, causing you to struggle for balance as it swings and sways with each step.

As you continue to traverse the icy landscape, you discover that the Reptail Curse impacts your daily life in unexpected ways. Your once-agile movements are now hindered by the tail's weight and size, making it difficult to navigate the narrow paths and crevices of the Abyss. The tail's spiky protrusions snag on clothing, tearing the fabric and leaving you increasingly vulnerable to the frigid air. <<if $playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Tipping the Scales")>>You also notice that the cold affects your tail more than the rest of your body, the reptilian scales offering little insulation against the biting chill.<</if>>

Though the Reptail Curse may seem like a burden, you find that it has its advantages. The tail can serve as a weapon, its spiky protrusions effective for repelling aggressive creatures that inhabit the Abyss, though perhaps not anything that would pose a serious threat to you. The tail also acts as a counterbalance once you're used to it, aiding you in maintaining your footing on the treacherous, icy terrain.

Despite these benefits, you can't shake the feeling of alienation brought on by the Curse. It almost feels like you aren't even human anymore.

As you venture further, the cold intensifies, penetrating even the thickest layers of your protective clothing. You rub your arms in a futile attempt to generate warmth, but it does nothing to dispel the icy tendrils that seem to have burrowed into your very core.

Suddenly, you feel an inexplicable force wash over you - a sensation akin to a thousand icy needles piercing your skin. You stumble to your knees, gasping for breath as aa wave of miasma envelops you. In that moment, you realize that you have been cursed.

As the Curse takes hold, you feel your body's physiology shift dramatically. The once comforting warmth of your own body heat begins to dwindle, leaving you shivering uncontrollably. Your skin grows cold to the touch, and a chilling realization dawns on you: you've become cold-blooded.

Desperation begins to set in as you ponder the implications of this Curse. How will you survive the relentless cold of this layer now that your body can no longer generate its own warmth? You'll need to rely on external sources of heat to keep from freezing. The thought of cuddling up to another adventurer or using a portable heat source to stave off the cold provides a small measure of comfort, but the increased travel times and frequent stops to build campfires weigh heavily on your mind.

With each step you take, the frigid air seems to mock you, reminding you of the transformation you've endured.

As you trudge through the biting cold and the relentless, swirling winds, the endless expanse of snow and ice begins to blur together. The Miasmal light casts eerie shadows across the landscape, and the numbing chill penetrates even the thickest of clothing. Just when hope seems all but lost, you spot a faint glow in the distance, cutting through the thick fog like a beacon.

Curiosity piqued, you cautiously approach the source of the light. Your breath catches in your throat as you lay eyes upon the mythical Purity Tree. The radiant white wood of the tree emanates a soft, yet mesmerizing iridescence that dances with the colors of the rainbow. The delicate, crystalline leaves chime in the gentle breeze, creating a soothing melody that echoes through the otherwise silent, frozen expanse.

As you draw closer, you notice that the air around the Purity Tree feels lighter, fresher, as if it's cleansing the miasma that clings to your lungs. The bitter cold momentarily retreats, as if in reverence to the tree's purifying aura. You can't help but feel a sense of awe at the sight of the rare and beautiful Purity Tree, standing defiantly against the harshness of the Abyss.

You consider your options carefully, knowing that the wood of the Purity Tree holds untold potential. Harvesting it could grant you the power to purify a significant amount of corruption and craft invaluable items, while leaving it be and merely basking in its cleansing smoke may offer a more temporary reprieve.

:: Pick up the Ghost-righter Writing Down [layer4]
<<CollectRelic $relic34>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

As your eyes adjust to the swirling, icy fog, you notice something peculiar - an odd, crystalline formation that stands out amid the snow and ice. It's a colossal glacier, perfectly clear and shining with a strange light through its blue glacial ice. What catches your attention are the countless, intricate carvings etched into its surface. Scenes of forgotten tales, narratives of ages past, and cryptic symbols intertwine, their elaborate designs shimmering and dancing under the dim, diffused light.

Approaching the glacier, you notice the design of an open book etched into the ice. You place your gloved hand onto it, the ice prickling your skin despite the protection. The etched book begins to glow, its outline brightening to a blinding white light. As quickly as it came, the light fades, revealing an alcove in the ice. Nestled within it lies a single, delicate feather - a stark contrast against the icy backdrop.

The feather is luminous in the dimly lit layer, its intricate barbs glowing gently like moonlight against the backdrop of frost. Picking it up, the feather feels almost weightless, but with an indescribable, pulsating warmth. The pen tip is sharp and surprisingly resilient, despite the softness of the feather. This is the Ghost-righter Writing Down - a Relic imbued with the power to turn even the clumsiest prose into elegant narratives.

You take out a piece of parchment from your satchel, scribbling a quick note using the feather. The ink from the feather flows onto the page like quicksilver, the cold seemingly having no effect on its fluidity. Satisfied, you tuck the parchment away for later. You can't help but look forward to the transformation that awaits the humble note.

Retrieving the Relic was just the beginning of the adventure. Holding the feather aloft, you can almost hear the echo of the countless stories, poems, and scripts that have been penned with it. The Relic whispers promises of perfect prose, tales untold, and a newfound sense of connection with the universal language of storytelling.

:: Pick up the Gilded Prison [layer4]
<<CollectRelic $relic35>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

The biting winds occasionally loosen icy chunks from the overhead canopy, which then tumble to the ground as snow or hail. Amidst this icy wilderness, you notice sparse, hardy shrubs huddling for warmth, their struggle for survival a stark contrast to the layer's serene beauty.

A sound interrupts your contemplation, a hollow, metallic echo that originates from the depths of a nearby glacial crevasse. Intrigued, you move towards the sound. The crevasse reveals a winding path that burrows deep into the glacier's heart. You decide to venture in, following the strange sound that seems to grow louder as you go deeper.

In the crevasse's gloom, you find an unexpected sight: an enormous, ornate golden cage, the Gilded Prison. The cage's lustrous surface is out of place in this icy world. Despite its location, it isn't touched by frost or ice. Intricate patterns carved onto its surface tell a story, perhaps of its creation, or of a forgotten civilization. As the sounds you heard earlier echo around you, you realize they emanate from the cage itself. It's as if the Gilded Prison is singing a lonely song in this frozen cavern.

With careful, measured movements, you approach the Relic. The air around it shimmers slightly, the only indication of its powerful effects. Taking a deep breath, you prepare to retrieve the Relic. You reach out and touch the icy-cold bars of the Gilded Prison. There's a quiet hum of power beneath your fingertips, a barely audible promise of preservation.

You retrieve the cage, taking care not to jostle it too much. It's surprisingly light, despite its size. The moment the Gilded Prison is moved, the shimmering air around it disappears, pausing its time-stopping properties. As you carefully pack it away, you spare a final glance at the icy cavern, once home to this precious Relic, as you continue your expedition.

:: Pick up the Omoikane Circuit [layer4]
<<CollectRelic $relic36>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

Up ahead, you see a sudden break in the icy monotony of the fourth layer. A massive glacier, towering into the foggy abyss above and buried deep into the frost-laden ground below. In its frozen heart, the faint outline of a structure, half buried and time-forgotten. A technological hub, perhaps once bristling with activity, now silenced by the inexorable march of time and ice. You approach, your curiosity piqued.

Despite the encroaching ice, the building's exterior still showcases glimpses of its former grandeur. Abstract, futuristic patterns etched into metal, barely discernible beneath the heavy frost. You make your way through a broken entranceway, stepping over the shards of a once-secure door.

Inside, the building is a maze of frozen-over technology, blinking lights dimly visible beneath a layer of frost. Frost-cracked monitors and desks laden with ancient devices, frozen mid-action. The freezing temperatures make everything brittle, but amidst this wreckage, a faint glow draws your attention.

Tucked away in a small, ice-encrusted room is a console, its screen emitting a soft, inviting light. On its surface, a slot that perfectly matches the size of a SIM card beckons. You move closer, intrigued by the console's unexpected liveliness amidst this icy tomb.

As you approach, a holographic display flickers to life, surprising you with its brightness and clarity. It depicts a swirling galaxy of information - circuits and codes coalescing into something... more. At the heart of this galactic display, there is a small, radiant object - a chip, glowing with a light that seems to cut through the biting cold. The Omoikane Circuit.

Your fingers carefully coax the chip from its frozen hold, warmth emanating from it and spreading through your numb fingers. You examine it closely, its surface gleaming with intricate circuitry, a silent hum coming from it, as if yearning for a host.

You stand there, in the heart of this icy ruin, holding the ultimate symbol of progress and technology. A beacon of warmth and life in the midst of the frigid Abyss. A connection to a time before the frost, a whisper of humanity's relentless will to thrive. The Omoikane Circuit is now yours.

:: Pick up the Afar Wanderer [layer4]
<<CollectRelic $relic37>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

Ahead, a peculiar sight breaks the endless white: an unusual, frosted structure that resembles a spiral staircase, formed by twisted, tortured ice formations. You approach cautiously, noticing a faint indigo glow emanating from the heart of the structure, buried deep within the coiled ice.

You ascend the frozen stairs, the cold growing more biting with each step. The closer you get, the stronger the glow becomes, illuminating the icy spiral with surreal radiance.

You arrive at the top, greeted by the sight of the Afar Wanderer, cradled in a bed of shimmering ice crystals. It's an otherworldly vision - a wand of flowing design, imbued with an indigo aura that pulses gently in rhythm with the windy breath of the Abyss. Its shape echoes the surrounding ice formations, as though it was birthed by the very heart of this icy realm.

You stretch out your gloved hand to retrieve it, but the moment your fingers brush the surface of the wand, the ice bed shatters abruptly. But the Wand floats in mid-air, held aloft by some unseen force. This gives you an opportunity to grab it. For a moment it feels resistant, as if tied to the pedestal that it formerly resided upon, but then the connection is broken and it feels like a normal wand in your hand and its glow fades.

With the Afar Wanderer secured, you make your way back, leaving the silent, icy tower behind.

:: Pick up the Kin Shifter [layer4]
<<CollectRelic $relic38>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

As you delve deeper into the fourth layer, the landscape subtly morphs. The snow-blanketed expanse is punctuated by small glacial mountains. You notice a peculiar cluster of icicles suspended from a protruding ledge, refracting the dim ambient light, providing just enough illumination to pierce through the fog. It appears like a gateway, an entrance to somewhere yet unexplored.

Drawn by the allure of discovery, you approach the icy archway. The crunch of your footsteps in the snow resonates in the silence. Beyond the gateway, you find a cavern, a stark contrast to the blizzard outside. The air within is eerily still, the cold less biting. Crystal formations cover the cavern walls, a maze of stalactites and stalagmites in a frozen tableau.

The heart of the maze houses an intriguing sight. An anomaly that refuses to be overlooked. Nestled in a depression in the icy floor is the Kin Shifter, a glob of putty-like slime. Its jelly-like substance oscillates in rhythm, a pulse of life amidst the frozen solitude. The face in the glob glimmers, decorated in a fashion that starkly contrasts the rest of its appearance.

Your heart hammers in your chest as you reach out. The air around the artifact seems to ripple with latent power. As your fingers make contact, you feel a pulse, akin to a dormant engine roaring to life. A portion of the Kin Shifter moves, reaching out, hungry for the touch of another Relic you possess. It is ready for the transformation, to emulate a perfect replica of a Relic you own, replicating all its characteristics, abilities, value, and weight.

Upon retrieving the Kin Shifter, it feels heavier, pulsating with the might of the abyss.

You can use this Relic to copy other Relics you have to get more uses out of them or just get a great value by copying other valuable Relics!

:: Pick up the Brave Vector [layer4]
<<CollectRelic $relic39>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

Your heart races as you approach the icy monolith, a hulking structure of metal and gears embedded in the snowy mountainside. The entrance, a yawning gateway with intricately interlocking cogwork, beckons you into its mechanical maw. As you draw closer, the relentless bitter cold seeping through your insulating gear seems to dissipate, replaced by an eerie warmth emanating from the mechanical fortress. You rub your frosted gloves together, relishing the momentary reprieve from the cold as you cross the threshold into the unknown.

The interior is a marvel of steampunk engineering. Vast cylinders of iron and brass turn endlessly, the rhythmic churning of gears and pistons filling the air with a deep, resonating hum. Shafts of cold light filter down from the ice overhead, casting an otherworldly glow on the maze of spinning machinery. The mechanical gears, despite their imposing size, move with a certain fluidity, an oddly harmonious balance between nature and machine.

As you navigate the labyrinth of cogwork, you notice an increasing intensity in the rhythm, the pulse quickening like the heartbeat of the mountain. Your eyes catch sight of a cylindrical metal pipe, remarkably ordinary amid the grandiose machinery. It lays horizontally, suspended in the air by a complex armature of gears and pulleys.

With a deep breath, you reach out to the pipe. It's cool to the touch, an oddity in this warm metal cave. Carefully, you disengage it from its mounting. The gears groan in protest, their rhythm faltering for a moment before finding a new equilibrium.

The Brave Vector is now in your possession. You marvel at its simple yet potent design. It's lighter than it looks, but when you drop a small piece of broken gear into one end, it shoots out the other end with a speed that makes your heart skip a beat. The very air seems to shudder in its wake.

Your mission accomplished, you carefully store the Relic in your pack. The mechanical fortress seems to sigh as you make your way to the entrance, the rhythm of the gears slowing, returning to their initial state. As you emerge back into the biting cold, the mountain behind you groans as it returns to slumber.

While this Relic may not be very functional in its current form as a bent pipe, a trip to the Relic Workshop could transform it into a powerful and efficient weapon.

:: Pick up the Devil's Own [layer4]
<<CollectRelic $relic40>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

As you move through the frosty expanse of the fourth layer, the chill seeping through your heavy clothing is almost unbearable. Each breath you draw is laced with the biting cold, making your lungs ache. Despite the layers of gear you donned before your descent, the miasma-enhanced cold pierces through, making your teeth chatter in an unending cadence. Small patches of stubborn vegetation peep out from under the snow, brittle from the relentless cold.

You spot a structure in the distance. It's a small, dilapidated cabin, just a mere silhouette against the icy mist. The cabin's roof is layered with heavy snow, threatening to collapse under the weight, while its walls are scarred from the trials of weathering the deadly cold. Its wooden door creaks ominously as the miasma-produced winds blow. This desolate cabin doesn't promise warmth or refuge, but it catches your interest. Something about it feels significant, perhaps even supernatural.

Steeling yourself, you move towards it, pushing through knee-deep snow, feeling the biting sting of hail against your exposed face. Inside the cabin, an uncanny sight greets you - amidst the freezing cold, a lone hearth glows with a soft, warm light. The heat radiating from it is soothing, a stark contrast to the cold that surrounds you.

Above the hearth hangs an aged painting, it depicts a strikingly green four-leaf clover standing out against a barren winter landscape. As you glance at the painting, a small drawer below the hearth catches your eye. Its wood is dark and old, and it creaks as you pry it open. Inside, nestled upon a velvet cushion, is a small charm. It's shaped like a four-leaf clover, and it gleams in the hearth's light - the Devil's Own.

As you pick up the charm, you feel a sense of peace wash over you. You note a lack of spilled ashes from the hearth, the absence of an errant gust of wind sneaking in from the cabin's decrepit walls. The menacing cold appears to have lost some of its bite. The charm's magic is subtle yet potent, and you tuck it away in your pocket, feeling safer than you have in a while.

If you have Cherry, this Relic will provide the useful boon of a single use reroll of her Chaotic Luck.

:: Pick up the Verve Cell [layer4]
<<CollectRelic $relic41>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

You trudge onward through the biting cold, every step crunching beneath your feet on the snow-laden ground. The fourth layer of the Abyss, an icy wasteland, is as beautiful as it is deadly. Small glacial mountains, crystalline in their sheen, rise like the backbones of ancient leviathans around you.

Ahead, you see an anomaly – a large, dome-like structure made entirely of ice, its surface glimmering with a multitude of colors refracted from the shards of ice above. The structure emanates a strangely welcoming aura, contrasting with the otherwise hostile environment.

You approach the ice dome, careful to remain alert for any sudden movements of the miasma, or the sudden falling of ice shards. The entrance of the dome is a narrow archway, just big enough for you to pass through. You step inside, and a warm gust of air surprises you. The interior is lined with glowing crystals, shedding a gentle, ambient light around. The warm air seems to emanate from these crystals, creating a pocket of refuge within the brutal cold of the layer.

In the center of the dome, mounted on an icy pedestal, rests the Verve Cell. It appears as an exquisite hammer, its form seems to be embedded with a few pieces of crystal that shimmer with latent energy. It looks remarkably light, and somehow you know that regardless of how hard you swing it, it will only ever deliver the lightest tap.

You extend a hand and cautiously pick up the Verve Cell. It hums in your grip, resonating with your touch. 

As you secure the Verve Cell into your satchel, you can't help but marvel at the subtle irony. In this place of relentless cold and harsh survival, you've found an instrument of control, a beacon of warmth in the relentless cold, its existence a testament to the unpredictable, dichotomous nature of the Abyss.

:: Pick up the Vessel Vivisector [layer4]
<<CollectRelic $relic42>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

Your instincts lead you towards a tall, glacier-topped mountain. Your eyes squint through the snowfall and you can see the mountain's icy apex, an ominous and daunting silhouette.

As you approach the glacial mountain, you can see something odd about the ice formation. It seems as if there's an unnatural separation in the ice, as if the glacier was split in two by some unseen force. A faint glow emanates from within, giving the icy divide a spectral quality. This resonates with the description of the Vessel Vivisector, its ability to create spectral duplicates, mirroring the spectral glow emanating from the glacial split.

You climb the mountain, maintaining your grip on the slippery ice. The cold is punishing, the wind howling like a feral beast, but you push on. Soon enough, you reach the divide. A shiver of anticipation courses through you as you reach into the crevice, your gloved hand brushing against something metallic.

Pulling it out, you find it's a small scalpel, delicate yet cold to the touch. The handle is etched with intricate designs that glow faintly, matching the spectral glow from the crevice. You can feel a sense of energy within it, the power of the Vivisector waiting to be unleashed.

As you hold the Vivisector, you test its power, making a slight cut on your hand. You watch as a ghostly afterimage separates from you, its translucent form mimicking your actions, your posture. It's a ghost, your ghost, performing the same act of discovery you just went through.

Looking around, you decide to use the Vivisector on one of the hardy plants, curious to see what would happen. After the cut, a ghostly replica of the plant appears, sitting sturdily against the harsh conditions, a phantom in the blizzard. It's a beautiful, haunting sight, yet the confirmation of the Relic's power sends a wave of relief through you.

:: Pick up the Sated Artist [layer4]
<<CollectRelic $relic43>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

As the freezing winds rip through your protective gear, you lower your gaze to the small, sparse vegetation around you. Trudging through the bitter cold, you spot a peculiar set of tracks leading to one of the ice mounds. You decide to follow it.

The tracks lead you into a hidden crevice within the ice. You enter it cautiously, the icy chill replaced by an eerie silence. It's a natural gallery, with the walls lined with hulking shapes of ice, each meticulously sculpted into various forms and shapes, catching the refracting light in a stunningly beautiful yet alien way.

The air in here is somehow softer, less hostile. As your eyes adjust to the dazzling spectacle, you spot a large, carved pedestal at the end of the gallery. Standing on it is a gigantic, ornate paintbrush, the Sated Artist.

Treading cautiously between the sculptures, you feel an intense magnetic pull. There is a palpable energy emanating from the relic that resonates in your chest. As you reach the pedestal, you can feel the icy cold give way to a warming hum from the Sated Artist.

The brush is made of a material you cannot identify, and the bristles seem to shimmer with an unworldly gleam. You take a moment to appreciate the craftsmanship of the object before you, before extending your gloved hand towards it.

As you grip the Sated Artist, you feel a jolt of energy pass through you. It feels... alive, buzzing, eager to create. The icy walls around you suddenly don't seem so lifeless anymore. With a sense of purpose, you dip the Sated Artist into a nearby pool of black miasma ink that bubbles up from a fissure in the floor.

Holding the brush, you make an attempt to paint, dragging it through the air. It feels like drawing on an invisible canvas. The miasma ink solidifies mid-air into a three-dimensional object. You draw a small cube, watching in fascination as it hovers in the air before settling down gently onto the icy floor. It's weighty, similar to iron, but bears all the hallmarks of the ink, creating an uncanny hybrid of fluidity and solidity.

A strange sensation, like satisfaction, courses through you. You grasp the Sated Artist, now realizing that the surrounding sculptures weren't carved from ice but painted into existence. This glacial studio is a testament to an artist's timeless presence, a creator who used the Sated Artist to paint life into the ice.

Carefully stowing the Sated Artist into your pack, you step back into the brutal cold outside the ice gallery. The icy wilderness seems different now, no longer just a cold, harsh expanse but a canvas awaiting the touch of the Sated Artist.

:: Pick up the Timekeeper's Keepsake [layer4]
<<CollectRelic $relic44>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

Off to your left, you notice an anomaly in this frost-bitten world - a giant mechanical sundial, half-buried in the snow, its large gnomon casting a long shadow despite the gloom. Surrounding the sundial are numerous metallic objects, suspended in mid-air, coated in thick ice, as if time had stopped for them eons ago.

Intrigued, you walk towards the sundial, leaving a trail of footprints on the unblemished snow. The static objects suspended in the air hum with an eerie energy that makes the air vibrate. You reach out tentatively, touching a metallic shard, and instantly, it's as if the suspended time itself resists your touch, repelling your gloved hand.

On instinct, you approach the center of the sundial where the gnomon stands firm. As you brush away the snow and ice, you reveal a hidden compartment. With a huff of effort, you pry it open to reveal the Timekeeper's Keepsake, the pocketwatch. The metallic casing gleams in the dim light, seeming to pulse with temporal power.

You twist the watch, stopping its movement and immediately, the humming energy surrounding the objects wanes, the frozen tableau of suspended items shudder before they drop onto the snow, freed from their temporal imprisonment. You hastily pick up the pocketwatch, its power released, allowing you to move it.

The cold suddenly seems to bite deeper, a reminder of the hostile environment you're in. You place the Timekeeper's Keepsake safely in your pocket, feeling the subtle tick-tock against your chest. It's as if time itself has taken a breath. As you trudge away from the ancient sundial, leaving the broken temporal field behind, the miasma-produced wind picks up once again, the snow begins to fall, and the Abyss's fourth layer reclaims its snowy monotony.

:: Pick up the Creator's Bolt [layer4]
<<CollectRelic $relic45>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

Ahead, through the dense veil of fog, a glimmer catches your eye. You squint, straining your eyes, and trudge towards the flicker. Gradually, the silhouette of an enormous, frozen archway materializes from the fog, standing resolute amidst the bleak, snowy expanse. Carved into the ice, the archway is etched with countless intricate patterns of twisting, intertwining lines - they almost appear like the plotlines of a thousand different stories, a silent testimony to the countless tales born in the hearts of humans.

A low hum resonates from beneath the snow, a vibration barely perceptible but enough to instill a sense of deep awe and trepidation. Behind the archway, obscured by a whirl of snow and frost, stands a giant, translucent pedestal of pure ice. And there, held aloft, gleaming in the low light filtering through the icy ceiling, rests the Creator's Bolt.

The Bolt appears almost ghostly, its shimmering metallic surface adorned with a mesmerizing red gem. It's easy to see how this Relic could harbor the power to create media from a mere thought. You feel an odd sense of reverence; this Relic has the power to bring to life the deepest desires and emotions of anyone it passes through.

With a deep breath, you advance, your hands outstretched. As you draw nearer, a comforting warmth begins to radiate from the Bolt, defying the freezing surroundings. Reaching out, you carefully wrap your fingers around the Relic, expecting it to be solid. Instead, it slips right through your grasp like a specter. Startled, you remember its description; it can't interact with living flesh.

An idea forms in your mind. You take a sock out of your bag, and open it as a small container. Holding the sock open, you try to maneuver the Bolt into it. With a small thrill, the arrow sinks into the fabric. You quickly draw the sock closed, trapping the Relic inside. Now encased in an inanimate object, the Bolt is yours to command whenever you choose to do so.

:: Pick up the Perpetual Repose [layer4]
<<CollectRelic $relic46>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

As you march on, a towering structure catches your eye — a glacial monolith, shimmering with a glacial blue light. Embedded in the glacier is a small, circular object. Upon closer inspection, you see it — the Perpetual Repose, its surface as smooth and untouched as the day it was forged. Its steadfast endurance, juxtaposed with the ice's fragility, only highlights its indomitable existence.

Your fingers graze the surface of the shield, but the ice is a bitter barrier, its cold bite causing your hand to recoil instinctively. Determination steeling your resolve, you carefully begin to chip away at the ice encasing the buckler. Each strike echoes across the icy expanse, a metronome in your quest.

The shield seems to absorb the shock from your strikes, the vibrations diffusing across its surface without leaving a mark. As the ice around the shield cracks and breaks away, you marvel at the sight—despite centuries spent in the harshest environment, the shield stands pristine.

As you hold the Perpetual Repose in your hands, feeling its inexplicable warmth against the biting cold, you can't help but appreciate the irony. Here, in the heart of an environment where everything is continuously eroded and destroyed, lies a Relic that refuses to yield.

The buckler is a fitting emblem of endurance against all odds, a symbol of the immutable spirit of the divers that brave the Abyss.

:: Pick up the Toral Wave [layer4]
<<CollectRelic $relic47>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

Suddenly, the hair on your arms stand on end, and you feel the subtle prickling sensation of static electricity in the air. You know you're close. Your heart races with anticipation as you proceed towards the source of the electric disturbance. You tread carefully around a towering shard of ice, when a unique spectacle steals your attention.

You find yourself standing at the precipice of a deep crevasse. An intricate dance of electric sparks lights up the chasm, weaving and winding their way around like the threads of an voltaic tapestry. They dance and twirl, throwing a wild and captivating show of glimmering light and shadow. The source of this electrical symphony is nestled in the heart of the crevasse: a sleek, silver loop, the Toral Wave.

Carefully, you maneuver your way down into the crevasse. With each descent, you can feel the electricity grow stronger, your skin tingling, your heart pounding like a wild drum.

You reach the bottom of the crevasse, a dim world lit only by the flickering electricity of the Relic. The Toral Wave rests in the snow on the ground, pulsating with energy, casting an array of silver streaks across the icy walls of the chasm. It is breathtakingly beautiful and dangerously powerful.

You reach out to claim the Relic, and the moment your hand touches the Toral Wave, a strong jolt of energy surges through you, making you gasp. You can feel the energy, controlled yet chaotic, coursing through you before finally dissipating harmlessly into the ground.

A source of electricity like this would be hard to use in combat, but perhaps if you had some way to safely channel it and fight with it then it could be more effective?

:: Pick up the Flamel's Folly [layer4]
<<CollectRelic $relic48>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

Ahead, through a veil of frost-tinted fog, you see an aberration in the natural landscape. A glacial formation, rising defiantly against the white expanse. Unlike the surrounding ice formations, this one glistens with a metallic sheen. It is a mountain, its height majestic, its form formidable, and its composition entirely alien. You can see veins of copper and silver threading the glacial body, spreading out like an intricate spider web. A glacier of metal in a realm of ice.

Despite the piercing cold, you venture closer. As you draw nearer, you can see the glint of other metals too. Striations of gold, blobs of mercury held captive within the steel-cold iron, speckles of titanium and zinc, all frozen in a moment of chaotic splendor.

The closer you get, the more you understand the metallic glacier is more than an anomaly; it is an echo of the Relic's very nature. A cacophony of elements, locked in constant flux, an embodiment of transmutation.

The mountainside is sheer, a daunting climb even for a seasoned climber. But you are undeterred. You start your climb, bracing against the whipping wind, the chilled metal against your hands an unusual contrast to the ice you'd been so accustomed to.

As you climb higher, the variety of metals changes. Now you can see rare, precious metals - palladium, platinum, and a hint of what could be rhodium. Their appearance sparks a thought: Could the Relic's effect have caused this? Is this glacier a monument to its power?

Your hands reach a small crevasse, offering a much-needed respite from the climb. Hidden within the shadowy recess, you find it. Flamel's Folly. The rod is tucked away, its length obscured in the shadows. It's cool to the touch, yet the connection ignites a sense of power within you. With it safely secured, you begin to make your way back down the mountain of metal and continue on your expedition.

The chills of this layer don't seem to abate one bit when you aren't on the ground. You do feel a bit of relief to move rapidly through the enormous vertical tunnel at the lowest point of the ice though, rather than an agozing climb through the steep cliffs and frozen tunnels.

:: Layer4 Preview [image layer4]
As you bring the charm up to your eye and gaze deep into the red crystal, your vision fades and a new image comes clearly into view:

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Layer Intros/l4intro.png']]

@@.layerTitle;LAYER 4 - HOARFROST WASTES@@

You see yourself trudging through thick layers of snow, and even with only your sight to view the layer, a deep sense of chills runs through you, as if the cold here were able to seep into your very being. Suddenly the image shifts and you see the splendor that you could find on this layer.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 5-relics.png']]

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 5-wonders.png']]

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and Curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 5-curses.png']]

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threaths that await you on the layer

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 5-threats.png']]

Finally, the vision fades, leaving you standing once again where you were before, with only a brief sense of motion sickness as you orient yourself back to your physical body. As you look at the Gleam Dazer once again, you notice the Relic is cracked and broken.

The beast moves gracefully, its tail and powerful appendages weaving through the air like tendrils of a living nightmare. Its presence is a chilling reminder of the dangers lurking in this seemingly serene layer of the Abyss.

The Drifting Swallower, sensing your movements, turns its attention towards you. Its appendages propel it forward with surprising speed, closing the distance between you in a matter of seconds. Your heart races as you fumble for your weapon, knowing that a mere five bullets could bring this creature to its end.

As the beast swoops down upon you, you observe its immense size and imagine the feeling of its slick, cold flesh skimming against your skin send shivers down your spine. Your body, unprepared for the sudden assault, trembles with a mix of fear and adrenaline.

How do you want to deal with the creature descending upon you?

If you allow it to overpower you, prepare to be vored! It will swallow you whole and you will spend the next 3 days inside of its large stomach being tickled and lightly burned by gastric juices enveloping your entire body.

:: Layer4 Swallower Ravage [layer4]

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/driftingswallower.png']]

As the Drifting Swallower closes in, you make no effort to evade it or reach for your weapon. Instead, you stand still, offering yourself willingly to the creature. The beast hesitates for a brief moment, as if surprised by your lack of resistance, before its slick, cold flesh makes contact with your body, sending shivers down your spine.

You are engulfed by the creature, its cavernous maw swallowing you whole. The moist, warm air inside the beast's mouth envelops you as the strong, musky scent of its saliva fills your nostrils. Its massive tongue wraps around you, its slick surface covered in tiny, writhing taste buds that explore every inch of your skin, leaving a trail of sticky saliva in their wake.

The sensation of being enclosed within the creature's mouth, the rhythmic pulsing of its throat as it swallows, and the gentle suction of its breath around you is both terrifying and undeniably exhilarating. With a final, powerful contraction, the tight, wet passage leads you to the beast's stomach.

As you slide into the Drifting Swallower's stomach, you land on a soft, cushion-like surface. The stomach walls are surprisingly warm, pulsating gently against your body with each of the creature's breaths. The air inside is humid and thick, carrying with it the pungent aroma of the beast's previous meals. Your senses are overwhelmed, the heady mixture of fear, excitement, and curiosity pushing you to the brink of sensory overload.

The stomach walls contract around you, moving in a slow, undulating rhythm that causes the gastric juices to lap at your most sensitive areas. The sensation is simultaneously ticklish and burning, as the potent digestive fluids seep through your clothing and make contact with your skin. The delicate balance of pleasure and pain intensifies with each passing moment, as the gastric juices tenderly lap and nibble at your body.

Through the darkness, you can hear the distant, muffled sounds of the creature's movements, a constant reminder that you're at the mercy of this massive beast. Your world has been reduced to the tight confines of its stomach, a space where you're both vulnerable and strangely secure.

As the hours pass, you find yourself slipping in and out of consciousness, the mixture of fear and sensory overload lulling you into a hazy, dreamlike state. You're acutely aware of every sensation, from the gentle, rhythmic pulsing of the stomach walls against your skin to the ever-present burning and tickling of the gastric juices that continue their relentless assault.

Three days later, the Drifting Swallower expels you from its body, leaving you battered and covered in light burns. You will increase all of your travel times by 1 day until you are healed.
