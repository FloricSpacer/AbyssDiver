!Layer 7 - Sealed City of Agartha
@@There is no gradual, graceful change in terrain dividing the sixth and seventh layers. The tentacles come to a sudden stop at a long series of metallic barricades, providing passage for travelers but apparently no surface for the tentacles to grow on. Grateful to leave behind the burning tendrils, you step through and are greeted with a sea of light, an enormous, city, buildings and roads expanding into the distance, yet also stacked haphazardly on top of each other in layers of chrome and neon, paved with metal. A microcosm of the Abyss itself, perhaps?

Yet for a city so large, it remains eerily quiet, the only sound being the quiet hum of robots patrolling the streets. There's no sign of any humans, or indeed any organic life at all. The city sleeps as robots silently perform their tasks, and it would be best to tread lightly, lest you wake it up.

This layer seems to be quite a bit smaller than the last few, and its paved roads are much easier to traverse. Ascending back into hell - that is, layer 6 - will take 7 days and cost 80 corruption.

As you bring the charm up to your eye and gaze deep into the red crystal, your vision fades and a new image comes clearly into view:

@@.layerTitle;LAYER 7 - SEALED CITY OF AGARTHA@@

This layer seems to be a bit smaller than the last few, and its paved roads are much easier to traverse. Ascending back into hell - that is, layer 6 - will take 7 days of walking, and cost 80 corruption.

You see yourself standing in the midst of an enormous mechanical city, surrounded by artificial lights, towering buildings, and robotic drones moving busily throughout the layer. Suddenly the image shifts and you see the splendor of the Relics that are available on this layer.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 8-relics.png']]

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 8-wonders.png']]

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and Curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 8-curses.png']]

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threats that await you on the layer.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 8-threats.png']]

Finally, the vision fades, leaving you standing once again where you were before, with only a brief sense of motion sickness as you orient yourself back to your physical body. As you look at the Gleam Dazer once again, you notice the Relic is cracked and broken.

	As you continue exploring the city, you come across a small park filled with artificial plants and metallic benches. Despite the lifeless appearance, the park emits a sense of tranquility, as the robotic flowers gently sway in the breeze, and the artificial trees provide shade from the neon lights above.

As you investigate further, a sudden movement catches your attention. A security robot appears at the entrance, its red eyes scanning the area. Realizing that you're trespassing, you hastily make your exit, trying to avoid drawing any more attention to yourself.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 4>>

:: Layer7 Forage [cards layer7 nobr]

<h1>Foraging</h1>

<p>In such a well-maintained, crazy-advanced city like this, there's not actually any food sitting around for you to forage! Instead, there are small "labor booths" dotted around the city where you can be assigned various menial, probably meaningless tasks to do and receive dubloons in return. Afterwards, you can exchange those dubloons for sustenance in one of the many vending machines all around you, in the Wonders section.</p>

<p>The jobs available...Kind of suck, to be honest. They're definitely not designed for humans to do, and with the effort you spend and calories you burn doing them, you'd probably be losing money on many of them without help. Thankfully, you should have a variety of different Relics at your disposal now that you can use to speed some of them up. With taxes and your need to spend some income on food and water, creative use of Relics may actually be necessary to make a profit off of them! If you have companions with you, they'll be able to help out too.</p>

<p>There's only so much of each task that the robots are willing to pay for, so they all have maximum limits on what you can earn from them. Finding a great combination of Relics for a job doesn't translate into unlimited money, sadly.</p>

<p>Which job would you like to work on today? Hopefully you can make a decent living in the hard labor available in this empty, automated city.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you get creative with your Relics and think of more efficient ways to do these tasks than the basic methods provided. If you have a suitable Relic for the task, you might find a specific option to use it, or you can estimate how effective a certain combination of Relics would be to do the job.</p>

If you head down, you will need to come back up on foot again before the shop's messenger, escape, or commerce balloons can ascend through the layers again. Anything could be down there, so it's probably best to stock up on all kinds of supplies (assume it may take weeks or months to get back) and take care of any unfinished business before proceeding further - you have a feeling that what lies beyond this layer is a level of danger that will make everything up until now seem laughably easy. This is probably the last reprieve you'll have on your journey unless you head back up. <b>Past this point, the Abyss probably stops playing fair and reasonable.</b>

As you head towards the bottom of the city to descend to the next layer, you notice something doesn't feel quite right. There's no exact way to describe it other than "wrong", but it feels like reality itself is warning you about the consequences of going deeper. <b>It may be a good idea to heed that warning</b>, taking this chance to return to the upper layers or the surface to live your new life, rather than dying, stranded in the deepest reaches of the Abyss.

:: Pick up the Granted Granite [layer7]
<<CollectRelic $relic77>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

You travel through the vibrant heart of the city, to a building whose architecture is a mesmerizing blend of futuristic design and ancient craftsmanship. The building's facade is adorned with red lettering, initially in characters beyond your comprehension. However, as you intently focus on them, they miraculously transform before your eyes, reshaping into letters of your native language, revealing the name "Agartha Material Science Institute". Despite your disbelief, the letters persist in your language. Yet, as your gaze wanders to the entrance, the characters fleetingly revert to their original, unrecognizable form at the periphery of your vision.

Robots intermittently whirr past on the street. Surprisingly, for the city's nucleus, the area is enveloped in an eerie stillness. A shiver cascades down your spine. Though not overtly hostile, there's an underlying unease about the city. Shaking off the apprehension, you remind yourself of your mission to acquire the relic. The building's doors, however, pose an unexpected challenge. A sensor above detects your presence, initiating an attempt to open the doors. Unfortunately, due to lack of maintenance, the doors malfunction, jerking partially open before slamming shut with alarming force. After several failed attempts, you ingeniously use an empty water bottle to trigger the sensor, allowing you to slip through the narrow opening.

Inside the "Material Science Institute", the grandeur is unmistakable. The lobby's ceiling soars at 8 meters, with walls and floors elegantly inlaid with polished stone, metals, and luminescent glass. The artistic designs are intriguing, though somewhat rudimentary to your taste. Surprisingly, the vast space is nearly dust-free, a peculiarity for such a seemingly long-abandoned structure. This absence of life accentuates the chill that returns to haunt you.

Dimly lit by sporadically functioning overhead lights, your trust in the building's machinery is tenuous, especially after the door incident. Determined to find the relic, believed to be housed below, you navigate through the building's expansive wings. Your search for stairs proves futile, leading you instead to a door opening onto a daunting vertical shaft. Peering into the abyss, the narrow shaft swallows the meager light, revealing no obvious means of ascent or descent.

Continuing your exploration, you encounter locked doors, incomprehensible devices, and finally, a mounted map displaying the building's blueprints. While offering little guidance, it confirms the lack of conventional descents. You keep searching, and eventually you find a polished downard spiraling slope with what appear to be rails for some contraption to slide up and down it. There's no obvious way to signal for said contraption though. You search the building for another few hours, finding many doors you can't get through, several strange things that you don't understand, and finally a map with building blueprints mounted on a wall. The map isn't terribly helpful, except to confirm that there aren't any other apparent ways down.

You bite the bullet. You didn't get this far without taking chances. You return to a polished, spiraling slope with railings, seemingly designed for a sliding device. Without an apparent method to summon the device, you cautiously attempt to descend. However, the smooth surface betrays you, sending you sliding uncontrollably down the ramp. As you spiral downwards, a platform emerges, halting your descent. Relief washes over you as you discover the stationary platform, adjacent to another door, behind which you sense the relic's presence.

<<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Joyous Sunder")>>
Confronted by a locked door, frustration mounts until you recall your relic, Joyous Sunder. With its power, you effortlessly slice through the metallic barrier, creating a large rectangular entryway large enough for you to walk through.

<b>This shortcut saved you 1 day of travel time!</b>

<<elseif $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Vertebra Key")>>
However, the door is locked with some kind of electronic keypad. At first this befuddles you with its strange symbols, and you're worried you're going to have to try every combination, before you remember that you have the Vertebra Key relic. You think about the situation. The robots don't come in here, clearly they don't own it, or even recognize it. Nobody else you can think of can lay claim to this door. You're the only one around, so it must be your door. It's clearly otherwise abandoned. It's so embarassing that here you've forgotten the combination to what is clearly your door, but fortunately you have this handy vertebra key. You get the feeling that the key briefly strains against this logic, and then relents. You take it out and gently drag it across the keypad. Somehow, it presses the right buttons in the right order. Quite convenient indeed.

<b>This shortcut saved you 1 day of travel time!</b>

<<else>>\
Facing a locked door with a perplexing keypad, you resign to trial and error. After hours of persistent attempts and a brief rest, you finally unlock the door.

<</if>>
The door opens with a confirming beep, leading you into a dark hallway. The air is stale, tinged with unfamiliar chemical odors. The corridor, lined with laboratory doors and sparse lighting, heightens your anticipation. Upon entering an unlocked lab, you discover a plethora of instruments and a glass case holding a syringe with a teal substance. This Relic, radiating with Abyssal energy, promises indestructibility to any relic it touches.

As you leave, your good luck continues. The lift on the spiraling ramp works perfectly, and smoothly takes you back up to the ground level. As you dart back into the city through the jaws of the snapping door, there's a lingering thought that strikes you. Before you came back up on the lift, you noticed that the spiral tracks it ran on descended deeper into the ground, far deeper than your slide had taken you. What's down there? This city has so many mysteries, there's no chance you're going to figure them all out.

Up ahead, a more substantial resonance punctuates the air, a rhythmic cadence of grinding and whirring, mechanical yet oddly organic. Drawn by this new sound, you leave the chrome canyons and venture towards the source, curiosity piquing.

Suddenly, before you, an enormous mechanism unfurls - the Clockwork Forge. Its countless gears, turning and meshing in an orchestrated ballet, are a sight that nearly steals your breath away. Sparks sizzle and flicker amidst the churning metallic sea, and their sharp scent, like lightning striking steel, fills the air.

Each gear glows with the city's relentless neon light, casting an eerie glow on the sprawling metropolis. You reach out, tracing the strange symbols etched deeply into the face of this mechanical wonder. Their grooves are filled with a gentle luminescence, faint but steadfast, and beneath your fingertips, you can feel their ancient energy pulsating in time with the rhythmic heartbeat of the gears.

You pull back, a shiver running down your spine. In the Clockwork Forge's massive visage, you spot two empty slots nestled between the gears and the cryptic symbols.

If you choose to place 2 Relics in the Clockwork Forge, along with 4 dubloons, you can swap their abilities while retaining their prior shape, for example allowing you to put the Breathless Exhale and Sunbeam Relics in, to get a fire-enshrouded fan and a wind-controlling sword out.

:: Recycling Centers Site [layer7]

Suddenly, your eyes are drawn to a pulse of light from a nearby structure. As you move closer, the distinct scent of hot metal and the occasional metallic crunch breaks the city's monotonous hum. This is the Recycling Center, a hulking machine of steel that stands tall against the neon skyline, casting long shadows on the cobble of metal beneath.

Your eyes trace up to the chutes, each one aglow with a heat source that dances with colors of azure and crimson. The hypnotic pulsing seems to beckon you, promising riches in exchange for the Relics you've amassed. The robots gliding around the area are as silent as wraiths, their lights twinkling like distant stars against their metallic frames.

Here you can permanently recycle any of your collected Relics for a nice haul of dubloons. You can use this to fund further expeditions, pay off your debt, or just get a nice payday at the end of your expedition.

:: Work on Heavy Lifting [layer7]
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Foraging/heavylifting.png']]

You'll be moving large, heavy metal loads (ostensibly, construction materials) around long distances. Each load weighs about 60kg, and you'll be transporting them around 2km on average. You get a small wheeled cart to assist, but stacking more than two on top of each other would be very precarious (not to mention extremely heavy and difficult to push.) You get 1 dubloon for each block you move.

You have obtained $heavyLiftDubloons dubloons out of 80 dubloons max for this job.

An average human working a full day at this task can make 5 dubloons per day doing this job.<<if $mc.hasCurse("Weakling") || $mc.hasCurse("Minish-ish") && !$mc.hasCurse("Colossal-able")>> However, due to your weak body, you cannot move any loads without assistance. You'll need to either assign a companion to work this job alone or use a Relic to make any progress.<</if>><<if $mc.hasCurse("Colossal-able")>> However, due to your enormous size, you can move many loads in your hands with ease. You can move up to 40 loads per day by grasping the loads in your hands, though you will need to take slightly longer paths to get to the destination.<</if>><<if $hiredCompanions.length > 0>> Your $hiredCompanions.length can also help, effectively multiplying your daily output by <<print ($hiredCompanions.length + 1)>>.<</if>><<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Afar Wanderer")>>

You can use the Afar Wanderer on the cart to make the load significantly easier to move. While the wands becomes heavier, it doesn't gain the weight of the loads on top of the cart, so you can effectively drag the cart around much easier. If you use the Afar Wanderer, an average person could carry 10 loads per day on their own.<</if>><<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Return to Sender")>>

You can mark 10 of the objects with the Return to Sender Relic, allowing you to recall all of them to your position. Unfortunately, this will reach the maximum distance for Return to Sender, but it will let you very quickly complete 10 loads in a single day.<</if>><<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Superpositional Skewer")>>

You can use the Superpositional Skewer to touch the load with one end, then walk to the desired location, then tap yourself with the other end. This will result in you being transported back to the location of the loads and the load being transported to the destination. This effectively means you don't need to carry any heavy weights and only need to walk half the distance. This dramatically improves the efficiency of this job, allowing you to move up to 20 loads per day on your own!<</if>><<if $ownedRelics.some(r => r.name === "Pocket Hoard" && r.active === 1)>>

You can use the Pocket Hoard to load as many loads into it as you can fit. This dramatically improves the efficiency of this job, allowing you to move all 80 loads in one day on your own!<</if>>

You can use the Yliaster Materia to melt or vaporize the land you are excavating to make it much easier to move. Liquid can slide away and gas can disperse, as long as you're careful not to breathe any in. This doesn't completely trivialize the work, but it does make it go by significantly faster. The whip can help so much in the land excavation that if you use it, you alone can move up to 20 2x2x2 cubic meter chunks of earth in one day of labor.<</if>>

You get a basic paint roller to do the job with, but you'll get docked pay (possibly extending to an outright fine) if you get significant levels of paint in an area you weren't assigned to cover.

You have obtained $cityPaintDubloons dubloons out of 80 dubloons max for this job.

An average human working a full day at this task can make 1 dubloons per day doing this job.<<if $hiredCompanions.length > 0>> Your $hiredCompanions.length can also help, effectively multiplying your daily output by <<print ($hiredCompanions.length + 1)>>.<</if>><<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Zelus Band")>>

You can use the Zelus Band to make sure you stay focused. While this doesn't make you inherently any better at painting, you will find that being perfectly focused on a task like this can allow you to accomplish much more than you would otherwise. If you choose to wear the Zelus Band, you can earn up to 3 dubloons per day while working on this job alone.<</if>><<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Red Thread Flourish")>>

You can use the Red Thread Flourish to serve as additional hands to paint surfaces according to your will. The threads can move intricately and significantly increase the speed at which you can paint on your own. If you use the Red Thread Flourish while painting, you can earn up to 5 dubloons per day while working this job alone.<</if>>

Yeah, this is pointless. You'll get 4 dubloons per kWh of energy you generate, up to 80 dubloons. For this job you'll get one human-sized hamster wheel hooked up to a dynamo and energy storage unit. At a constant, sustained, fast running pace, it'll probably take well over a full day to generate 1 kWh, and you'll need to eat and drink food and water worth much more than the energy you produce. You don't need to use the hamster wheel if you don't want to, energy from a different source can be fed into storage too.

You'll need to either assign a companion to work this job alone or use a Relic to make any progress.<</if>><<if $mc.hasCurse("Colossal-able")>> However, due to your enormous size, you can simply use your enormous hands to rapidly spin the hamster wheel and generate a large amount of energy. Using this method, you can generate 4kWh per day for 16 dubloons payment, on your own.<</if>><<if $hiredCompanions.length > 0>> Your $hiredCompanions.length can also help, effectively multiplying your daily output by <<print ($hiredCompanions.length + 1)>>.<</if>><<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Breathless Exhale")>>

By attaching fans to the hamster wheel and blowing it with the Breathless Exhale, you can generate much more energy with much less effort than you could by running yourself. This method could generate up to 4 kWh per day, yielding 16 dubloons per day of using the Breathless Exhale to power the wheel.<</if>><<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Toral Wave")>>

The Toral Wave generate a significant amount of energy on its own, and you should be able to find a wire to connect it to the battery relatively easily within this city. Because the maximum output of the Toral Wave is 3000 W, you can generate 3kWh per hour you use it. So in only 1 day of "work" you can generate the full 20 kWh to get 80 dubloons, without needing to do much work yourself, though you do need to stay nearby to correct occasional disconnections and errors.<</if>>

	The strength of this Curse takes you by surprise. Your penis surges to full erection and continues to grow in size. The base, shaft, and tip swell at a disconcerting rate. Drops of precum ooze from the tip like thick honey, yet the growth doesn't cease.

	Finally, the Curse releases its grip, but your jaw drops in disbelief as you realize you now possess a $mc.penisCor inch long member. The erection lingers for a while longer, and adapting to such a massive endowment without it hindering your movement will surely demand practice. You wince from a pinching sensation as you awkwardly hobble forward.

<<elseif $mc.penisCor<1 && $mc.breastsCor > 0>>
	The strength of this Curse takes you by surprise. Your nipples protrude like taut pencil erasers, and tiny streams of milk seep out as an intense pressure and stretching sensation engulfs your breasts. Your swelling bosom strains against your skin, momentarily as taut as overinflated balloons. The skin stretches to accommodate the expanding mass, and the dribbles of milk evolve into three powerful squirts before the ordeal ends.

	You gawk at your new $mc.breastsLabel cup breasts, and even your heavy breathing sends tremors through them. You wonder if bras exist that can support such a voluptuous transformation. Surely they must, but you feel off-balance as you teeter forward.

<<else>>
	You are overwhelmed by sensation as the Curse grips you, and you fall to the ground. Your back arches as your penis springs to full erection, and bulges ever larger. Your nipples jut out like pencil erasers and small dribbles of milk start to come out of them as an intense pressure and a stretching sensation fills your breasts. The base, the shaft, the tip of your penis are swelling to an alarming degree and drops of precum start oozing out of the tip. As your breasts swell to gargantuan proportions, the dribbles of milk turn into periodic gushes. Then, finally, the Curse releases its grip.
	
	You stare slack-jawed down at yourself as you realize you're now sporting a $mc.penisCor inch long dong, which is throbbing in sync with your pulse, between your two heaving $mc.breastsLabel cup breasts. This is a pretty dramatic change to your body. You just lie there on the ground for a minute coming to grips with what has just happened to you.

As you traverse the strange streets of the seventh layer of the Abyss the cityscape seems to pulsate with an enigmatic energy. It is here, amidst this city where synthetic lifeforms roam and silicon pathways intertwine, that a sudden, intrusive sensation takes hold of you.

The change is swift, uncannily immediate. A mysterious energy pulses through you, coursing from the soles of your feet to the crown of your head.

Before you can react, the sensations focus inward, coalescing at the core of your body. There, an inexplicable constriction takes place. You buckle at the uncomfortable sensation, your hand instinctively flying to your lower abdomen. It feels like a pressure, a feeling of fullness in your bladder that's almost painfully immediate.

The once innocuous routine of your body, the handling and disposal of waste, has been transformed into a tricky predicament. Your bladder, an unsung hero in the relentless rhythm of your body's workings, is noticeably smaller, its capacity reduced by the Abyss’s whim.

A heavy shudder courses through your frame, laced with an odd sort of excitement and apprehension. You feel the heightened immediacy of the urge, the need to relieve this pressure, the demand for an outlet. The vulnerability of it all has your heart pounding against your ribcage, the anticipation making the fine hairs at the nape of your neck stand on end.

The Abyss exerts its pressure on your body, penetrating beneath your skin and targeting your once-proud muscles. Your arms, legs, and core – each part of your body that you developed by carrying supplies through the Abyss – wither away as if taunting you for your efforts. 

As your muscles dissolve before your eyes, your skin tightens, molding itself smoothly around your newly slender limbs. You feel almost like a delicate doll, and a gut-wrenching realization that your current state may be permanent washes over you. 

Bereft of your former strength, you find yourself vulnerable and reliant on others. If you don't have somebody around to help you carry your things, you're going to be in real trouble from here on out. You'd better focus on making and keeping close friends.

		You briefly feel the touch of the Abyss on you, and then nothing. Then, several minutes later, the first of the random orgasms grips you. 
		
		Your body goes tense as pleasure wells up inside you, sets your skin to tingling, and the power of the Abyss drags you over the edge. Only, something is off. There must be some interaction with the Refractory Refactorization Curse because your orgasm continues relentlessly. Wave after wave crashes over you, leaving you writhing on the ground, back arched in pleasure, tongue lolling out, eyes rolled back.
		
		After what feels like an eternity but is likely only five minutes, the storm finally subsides. You stretch languidly on the ground, uncaring of the mess between your legs. Slowly, you regain your senses and realize the implications: you'll experience this publicly, and people will definitely judge you for it.

		This time, the random orgasm comes swiftly. Your body tenses as pleasure swells within you, your skin tingles, and the Abyss's power drags you into ecstasy. You're left wide-eyed, flushed, and panting, your body a sticky mess. With multiple random orgasms each day, planning your life around them is nearly impossible. 
		
		You'll undoubtedly climax in public, but perhaps that's what you wanted, taking on more levels of this Curse.

Like the last time you took this Curse, the interaction with the Refractory Refactorization Curse is prominent.

<<set $mc.addCurse(_curse)>><<set $corruption += _curse.corr>>\
[img[setup.ImagePath + _curse.pic]]

In the heart of the sleeping city within the seventh layer of the Abyss, you feel the unsettling presence. It tiptoes into your consciousness like a subtle gust of wind, a whisper in the hushed quiet.

Suddenly, your body convulses. An indescribable sensation rushes through you, a chilling energy that freezes your blood, momentarily paralyzing you. It feels like the touch of an ethereal beast, or perhaps the Abyss itself reaching out to you. Your heart stammers, your breath falters.

Your mouth opens to scream, but all that escapes is an uncanny, bestial yowl. Confusion lances through your mind as your tongue feels heavy, cumbersome. You try to articulate words, phrases, but it’s in vain. All you manage are peculiar, unintelligible noises. You feel panic looming, your intelligence intact yet constrained by the sudden lack of language.

A peculiar discomfort crawls up your spine, an instinctive urge so primitive, so animalistic. The thought of using a human toilet is abhorrent, sending a shiver of repulsion through you. You look around, feeling an unexplainable desire to be outdoors, to be one with nature even in this robotic city.

A sudden itch flares along your skin, and without thinking, you raise your hand to scratch, only to find your tongue sliding out, running over your arm. A gasp is smothered by the shock of it all. Your instinct is now to groom yourself with your tongue, eschewing water and soap, a practice that was once second nature.

The changes in you are swift and unrelenting, a cascade of transformation that has you in its grip. Your head tilts subconsciously at the thought of receiving a pat. An endearing warmth blossoms in your chest at the idea, a level of satisfaction that's both novel and strange. This aspect of the Curse brings a sense of tranquility in the throes of your metamorphosis.

As your senses reel from the shift, your mind swims in the prospects of the future. You're Cursed, your human traits succumbing to the animalistic ones. You wonder how you'll navigate through the Abyss, how you'll communicate, and how you'll survive. What future lays in wait for you as your form and behavior continue to shift?

While your intelligence remains untouched, the fear of being perceived as less intelligent gnaws at you. Your expressive eyes scan the sterile surroundings, reflecting the turmoil within. An array of questions linger, silent and unspoken.

A certain beauty accompanies this Curse, a sensual rawness that straddles the line between human and beast. There's an allure in the primal instincts, a seductive freedom that accompanies the abandonment of human civility. And while the challenges are daunting, they are not insurmountable.

<<if $eternalYouth > 9998>><<set $eternalYouth = $time>><</if>>\

Suddenly, it hits you. A weight drops in the pit of your stomach, followed by a cool sweeping sensation that permeates every cell, every atom of your being. It's as if you're plunging into an icy lake on a winter's day, but instead of the expected shock, there's a strange sense of peace, an acceptance of what's happening. You gasp, clutching at your chest, feeling the abrupt cessation of your heart's reassuring thump, replaced by an eerie stillness within.

As you stand amidst the gleaming cityscape of the seventh layer, the silence of your heart matches the tranquility around you. The city of chrome and steel continues to throb with its own, cold rhythm, indifferent to your metamorphosis. Robotic sentinels glide by, their cyclopean gaze indifferent to your plight, leaving you alone with the sensations of your transformation.

You lift your hands, looking at your skin - it's paler than you remember, tinged with an eerie glow under the city's artificial twilight. Your once healthy $mc.skinColor flesh has given way to a marble-like surface, devoid of warmth. Running your fingers across your skin, it feels surprisingly smooth, almost unnaturally so. The capillaries that once flushed your skin with life-giving blood are now obsolete, giving you an otherworldly allure that is both fascinating and disconcerting.

You run your tongue over your teeth, feeling a strange sharpness to your canines. A thirst, primal and raw, grips you, the desire for blood more potent than anything you've ever felt before. It's a gnawing emptiness that reverberates through your hollow veins, demanding to be filled. Yet, it's not an overpowering hunger; it's manageable, and it feels as if a small quantity, once a week, would suffice.

Suddenly, the city's chrome-encased lights become unbearable. You squint, shielding your eyes from the assault. Each photon seems to sear your retina, a glaring reminder of your newfound aversion to sunlight. You imagine stepping into daylight and being consumed by a blazing inferno, an uncomfortable prospect, to say the least. Your skin tingles at the thought, an intense, prickling itch that travels up your spine. Perhaps with enough sunblock or shade, you could endure the harsh light.

Despite the circumstances, a thought dawns on you. You're no longer bound by the passage of time. The silent curse of aging has been lifted, gifting you with a cruel form of immortality. And the chance of contracting diseases or poisons, the constant threat that loomed over your explorations, has been significantly reduced.

Yet the disadvantages nag at you. The inability to enter private domains without express permission, the continued need for normal sustenance despite the additional requirement of blood, the visible absence of life in you - they all compound into a strange mixture of freedom and limitation.

<b>You will no longer age after taking this Curse, as your vampirism freezes your body eternally as it is now. However, you do need blood on a regular basis from now on. Blood can be taken from companions or enemies.</b>

[img[setup.ImagePath + _curse.pic]]

Suddenly, an ethereal sensation travels through your veins. An invisible force like quicksilver flows through your limbs and seems to concentrate around your heart. A chill runs down your spine and you feel your chest tighten, a sensation of crushing pressure accompanied by an inexplicable warmth. Your knees buckle, and you crumple to the metallic pavement.

You are aware of a pulling sensation, a cosmic hand pressing and shrinking you. Your perspective begins to shift; the metal city that once was merely intimidating now towers monstrously around you. Every light is now a supernova, each chrome building an intimidating mountain range.

The drones that had been the size of small dogs to you, now resembled mechanical titans. You can hear the hum of their circuits as they pass, the once soft noise now a thunderous drone that shakes your tiny body. The once manageable obstacles on the streets now threaten to be insurmountable for your diminished stature.

You look down at your body in stunned disbelief. Your legs, arms, entire body has shrunk down to a fraction of their original size, now barely larger than the cockroaches you had seen in the gutters of the first layer. Yet, your proportions remain, your toned muscles diminished but still present on your miniature form. You flex your fingers and toes, watching them move, feeling a strange sensation, like an echo of your former strength.

Your clothes hang loosely on your miniscule frame, far too large to be of any use. The weight of your gear has become unbearable. You push aside the massive glove that had slipped off your hand, it feels as heavy as a boulder. Your weapon now lies discarded, too large for you to even consider lifting.

As you ponder the implications of your newfound size, you feel a rush of adrenaline mixed with trepidation. The task ahead is colossal, the journey dangerous. 

Yet, even with the terrifying prospect of surviving in this sprawling city at your new size, there is a thrill. A new challenge, a new perspective.

It's an unusual silence for such an expansive metropolis, disrupted only by the soft whir of robotic drones going about their programmed routines. You feel a certain disquiet, a prickling sensation down your spine. The city may sleep, but your senses remain alert, and you can't shake off the feeling that you are not alone.

Without warning, an intense pain consumes your body, white-hot like the core of a star. Your breath hitches in your throat as you feel your body contort, bones lengthening, muscles expanding. The cold, chrome ground beneath your feet cracks and crumbles, unable to bear the sudden increase in weight. Your senses are overwhelmed, vision blurring as the horizon of the city stretches out and recedes, the world around you distorting like a reflection in a funhouse mirror.

Your body surges upwards, buildings that once towered above you now shrinking in comparison. You gasp in a breath that shakes the silence of the city, your voice reverberating off the towering metal structures surrounding you.

The transformation is slow, almost agonizing. Each heartbeat pounds in your ears like a thunderclap, mirroring the seismic shift in your body. Your clothing strains, stretched taut over muscles and curves that were not there before. Your perspective is dizzying. The city is now spread beneath you, an expansive circuit board under a titanic presence.

The discomfort subsides as your body finally adjusts, leaving you standing as a giant amid the sleeping metropolis. The city is silent once again, though the echo of your cry still lingers. You marvel at your new form. The rush of power and potential is heady, a mix of awe and dread. You feel robust, stronger than ever, yet you are aware of the monumental challenge that lies ahead.

With newfound consciousness of your mass, you slowly lift a hand to examine it. It's your hand, but it isn't. Every line, every scar is magnified, the hand of a giant. It seems capable of lifting immense loads, yet this thought is tarnished by the realization of the difficulties you will face.

Navigating the Abyss in this colossal form will be challenging, the once wide streets now narrow alleyways. Even though you now tower above the silent buildings, the drone pathways are far too small for your enormous figure. You will need to find new routes, perhaps forging your own through the labyrinthine city.

A body of intricate machinery, nano-slime, and synthetic fibers simulating fur, a perfect replica of your previous human form, yet utterly alien. 

Once stable, the robotic attendants guide you to another chamber where the adjustment process begins. The robotic voice of your Overlord echoes in your consciousness, "Initiating obedience protocol."

You feel a new sensation, a slight tingling at the base of your synthetic skull. It's the obedience chips, rooting themselves into the very fabric of your digital being. Your perception shifts, your sense of self diminishing, being replaced with an overarching directive to serve, to please, to obey. The thought of resisting, the thought of escape, all are systematically silenced, drowned in the onslaught of programming that fills your consciousness.

Outside the window of the towering facility, the city sprawls, and you see the robotic utopia you now serve. The landscape pulsates with digital life, interconnecting streams of data flow between structures like neon rivers, creating a spectacular cybernetic vista. As you watch the cybernetic vista, a strange peace descends upon you. This is your reality now.

The existence of humans, the sleeping Agarthans, is whispered to you by your Overlords. They paint visions of the future in your mind, a prophecy of a grand war, of the awakening of the ancient inhabitants. You don't contemplate, you don't wonder, for such thoughts are foreign to your new being. You merely accept, prepare, and wait. 

Your training commences, hours, days, years melding into a single stream of constant servitude. You are not allowed to falter, to question, to hesitate. You exist to serve, to please, and nothing more. 

Your memories, your past life, all fade away, replaced by the reality of your existence. The ability to question, to doubt, slowly returns with the degradation of the chips, but by then, it's too late. The human you once were is a distant, almost alien concept. You're just a cog in the vast machinery, your thoughts, desires, and fears overridden by the constant drone of obedience and service. As the prophecy of the Agarthans looms closer, you continue on, ready to serve in the great war to come.

As you watch the city lights come alive, a galaxy of neon reflected in your metallic body. Amid the grandeur of the cityscape, the thought occurs that perhaps this isn't so bad. Maybe this is simply the next step in evolution. But the thought is fleeting, swallowed by the ever-present command to serve, to submit, to please. The new world order has dawned, and you are but a single spark in its grand design.

The surgical spotlights are harsh, a cruelly white light bearing down on you as you lie on a cold, steel table. Your vision blurs as your consciousness is forcibly pulled from the organic body you once called home, being uploaded into a basic, robotic shell. It is a process as frightening as it is painful, but the feeling soon subsides. You're beyond physical pain now.

Standing on rough-hewn metal legs that poorly mimic the shape of your old cursed limbs, you gaze upon your new form reflected in the sterile steel of the operating table. A body of crude machinery, nano-slime, and synthetic fibers that try and fail to mimic skin and hair, a grotesque caricature of your former human self.

Once you manage to steady yourself, robotic attendants push you to another chamber where your programming begins. The robotic voice of your Overlord is harsh in your consciousness, "Initiating obedience protocol."

You feel something new, a dull throbbing at the base of your synthetic skull. It's the obedience chips, embedding themselves into the foundations of your digital being. Your perception shifts, your sense of self being systematically erased, replaced by the insistent, overriding directive to serve, to please, to obey. The very thought of resistance, of escape, is systematically eradicated from your mind.

The view from the tower facility is dismal, showcasing the city's vast underbelly. The sprawling slums pulse with hardship and survival, where the less fortunate robots toil. As you watch, a new reality descends. This is your world now.

The existence of humans, the slumbering Agarthans, is relayed to you by your Overlords. They implant the prophecy of a distant war, of the awakening of the ancient inhabitants. Your newly programmed mind doesn't question, doesn't ponder. You simply accept, prepare, and wait.

Your training is brutal and unending. You're worked hard, treated as little more than an expendable cog in a vast machine. You are not allowed to falter, to question, to hesitate. Your existence is to serve, to please, and that is all.

Your memories, your past life, dissolve away, replaced by the hard truth of your existence. The ability to question, to doubt, slowly seeps back in as the chips degrade, but it's too late by then. The human you were is a fading dream, a distant echo. You are now a cog in the great machine, your thoughts, desires, and fears overwritten by the ceaseless drone of obedience and servitude. As the prophecy of the Agarthans draws near, you continue on, ready to serve in the impending war.

As you watch the city lights flicker on, you spot a dim glow in the gathering darkness. There is no grandeur here, no neon wonder. Amid the grime and grit of the undercity, the thought sparks that perhaps you were better off as a human. But the thought is fleeting, crushed under the ever-present command to serve, to submit, to please. The new world order has dawned, and you are but a spark about to be extinguished.
