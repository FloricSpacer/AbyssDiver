!Layer 7 - Sealed City of Agartha
@@There is no gradual, graceful change in terrain dividing the sixth and seventh layers. The tentacles come to a sudden stop at a long series of metallic barricades, providin passage for travelers but apparently no surface for the tentacles to grow on. Grateful to leave behind the burning tendrils, you step through and are greeted with a sea of light, an enormous, city, buildings and roads expanding into the distance, yet also stacked haphazardly on top of each other in layers of chrome and neon, paved with metal. A microcosm of the Abyss itself, perhaps?

Yet for a city so large, it remains eerily quiet, the only sound being the quiet hum of robots patrolling the streets. There's no sign of any humans, or indeed any organic life at all. The city sleeps as robots silently perform their tasks, and it would be best to tread lightly, lest you wake it up.

This layer seems to be quite a bit smaller than the last few, and its paved roads are much easier to traverse. Ascending back into hell - that is, layer 6 - will take 7 days and cost 80 corruption.

:: Layer7 Preview [image layer7]
As you bring the charm up to your eye and gaze deep into the red crystal, your vision fades and a new image comes clearly into view:

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Layer Intros/l7intro.png']]

@@.layerTitle;LAYER 7 - SEALED CITY OF AGARTHA@@

You see yourself standing in the midst of an enormous mechanical city, surrounded by artificial lights, towering buildings, and robotic drones moving busily throughout the layer. Suddenly the image shifts and you see the splendor of the Relics that are available on this layer.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 8-relics.png']]

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 8-wonders.png']]

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and Curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 8-curses.png']]

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threaths that await you on the layer

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 8-threats.png']]

Finally, the vision fades, leaving you standing once again where you were before, with only a brief sense of motion sickness as you orient yourself back to your physical body. As you look at the Gleam Dazer once again, you notice the Relic is cracked and broken.

A quiet humming sound descends upon you as you see the Taxdrone floating towards you from over a nearby building. You reach into your pack to get your typical dubloon payment, but then you realize something is wrong, you can't find any dubloons! Perhaps you didn't keep track of them properly? But it's too late to get any now, the taxes are already due.

The Taxdrone patiently requests that you submit your taxes as it displays a slot for you to deposit the dubloons into, but soon it realizes you will not be paying and the typically soft blue lights on the drone change to glaring red and an alarm sounds.

Within a moment you are restrained by nets made of light and you feel a prick on your neck. You notice the drone has stabbed you with a syringe, but at this point it's too late to resist and your consciousness begins to fade, leaving you to succumb to your fate.

You are now forced to become a permanent resident of Layer 7.

	As you continue exploring the city, you come across a small park filled with artificial plants and metallic benches. Despite the lifeless appearance, the park emits a sense of tranquility, as the robotic flowers gently sway in the breeze, and the artificial trees provide shade from the neon lights above. You decide to rest here for a moment, allowing your mind to process the bizarre surroundings and gather your strength before continuing your journey.<br><br>

	You notice movement in the distance, and as you approach, you see a group of small, spider-like robots working together to repair a damaged section of a building. Their movements are precise and efficient, but they don't seem to pay any attention to you. It's fascinating to watch them at work, but you remember that you're in a foreign and potentially dangerous environment, so you continue on your way, trying to remain as inconspicuous as possible.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 3>>
	As you cautiously navigate the metallic cityscape, you stumble upon a seemingly abandoned workshop, its doors left ajar. Inside, you find a collection of old robotic parts and tools scattered across the floor. You can't help but feel a sense of sadness for the broken-down machines, as if they were once a part of this robotic society, now discarded and forgotten. As you investigate further, a sudden movement catches your attention. A security robot appears at the entrance, its red eyes scanning the area. Realizing that you're trespassing, you hastily make your exit, trying to avoid drawing any more attention to yourself.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 4>>
	As you navigate the metallic streets, you come across a small, boxy robot diligently scrubbing the ground. It seems to be preoccupied with its cleaning task, and pays you no mind. Although its appearance is somewhat endearing, you decide not to disturb its work and continue onward.<br><br>

:: Layer7 Exit1 [layer7]
This is the last area where balloons of any kind can function.

If you head down, you will need to come back up on foot again before the shop's messenger, escape, or commerce balloons can ascend through the layers again. Anything could be down there, so it's probably best to stock up on all kinds of supplies (assume it may take weeks or months to get back) and take care of any unfinished business before proceeding further - you have a feeling that what lies beyond this layer is a level of danger that will make everything up until now seem laugably easy. This is probably the last reprieve you'll have on your journey unless you head back up. Past this point, the Abyss probably stops playing fair and reasonable.

As you head towards the bottom of the city to descend to the next layer, you notice something doesn't feel quite right. There's no exact way to describe it other than "wrong", but it feels like reality itself is warning you about the consequences of going deeper. It may be a good idea to heed that warning, taking this chance to return to the upper layers or the surface to live your new life, rather than dying, stranded in the deepest reaches of the Abyss.

If you're not dissuaded and choose to continue onward, it will take you 8 days to reach this layer's bottom.

	After you are pulled into the giant security robot, you are placed in a cell and bombarded with propaganda recordings about life in the city and your place in it. It seems to be nonsense, why would you want to serve organics? You are an organic!

	Of course you can't tone it all out, but it's pretty easy to keep your eyes on what matters and you patiently wait until the time is up and you are released.

	Once again, you are pulled into the security robot to hear the familiar tales of how to be a productive part of society.

	For some reason, you find yourself paying a but more attention to the videos and voices, and you realize that they're not actually as ridiculous as you first thought.

	Sure, you're free right now, but with subservience can come great pleasure, and what greater pursuit in life is there than pleasure? Your pleasure centers could be continually stimulated by following orders and following what is demanded of you.

	Fine, you're an organic being, but the miraculous technology of the city could change that, they could change you so that you fit neatly into the mechanisms of society here. No need to let your messy fleshy bits get in the way of a better life for you and everyone else.

	Yeah, you do have goals of things you want to do, but why are your goals more important than the goals of an entire city? Especially when they are as grand as the City of Agartha preparing for the future awakening of its organic population!

	When the robot releases you, you are tempted to go back and take up residence here, but shake off the feeling and continue your journey.

	The arguments they are making actually make perfect sense, they seem to precisely match your own thoughts actually. As if they were molded to you (or the other way around.)

	With subservience can come great pleasure, and what greater pursuit in life is there than pleasure? Your pleasure centers could be continually stimulated by following orders and following what is demanded of you.

	When the robot releases you, you are free to go, but you do not use that freedom.

	Now is your chance, you've found a place where you belong.

	It's time to stay in your new home.

	You tell the robot that you are ready to take your place as a gear in the mechanism of society and almost immediately a syringe comes out of the wall and pokes your neck. You smile as your consciousness fades.

	After you are pulled into the giant security robot, you are placed in a cell and bombarded with propaganda recordings about life in the city and your place in it. It seems to be nonsense, why would you want to serve organics? You are an organic!

	The biggest threat here is your boredom, honestly. While you try to fall asleep the robot makes an effort to keep you awake, in a kind of minor psychological torture through annoyance.

	Eventually you are released though, with no harm done, and ready to continue your journey in the seventh layer.

:: Work on Heavy Lifting [layer7]
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Foraging/heavylifting.png']]

You'll be moving large, heavy metal loads (ostensibly, construction materials) around long distances. Each load weighs arbout 60kg, and you'll be transporting them around 2km on average. You get a small wheeled cart to assist, but stacking more than two on top of each other would be very precarious (not to mention extremely heavy and difficult to push.) You get 1 dubloon for each block you move.

You have obtained $heavyLiftDubloons dubloons out of 80 dubloons max for this job.

An average human working a full day at this task can make 5 dubloons per day doing this job.<<if $playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Weakling") || $playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Minish-ish") && !$playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Colossal-able")>> However, due to your weak body, you cannot move any loads without assistance. You'll need to either assign a companion to work this job alone or use a Relic to make any progress.<</if>><<if $playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Colossal-able")>> However, due to your enormous size, you can move many loads in your hands with ease. You can move up to 40 loads per day by grasping the loads in your hands, though you will need to take slightly longer paths to get to the destination.<</if>><<if $hiredCompanions.length > 0>> Your $hiredCompanions.length can also help, effectively multiplying your daily output by <<print ($hiredCompanions.length + 1)>>.<</if>><<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Afar Wanderer")>>

You can use the Afar Wanderer on the cart to make the load significantly easier to move. While the wands becomes heavier, it doesn't gain the weight of the loads on top of the cart, so you can effectively drag the cart around much easier. If you use the Afar Wanderer, an average person could carry 10 loads per day on their own.<</if>><<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Return to Sender")>>

You can mark 10 of the objects with the Return to Sender Relic, allowing you to recall all of them to your position. Unfortunately, this will reach the maximum distance for Return to Sender, but it will let you very quickly complete 10 loads in a single day.<</if>><<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Superpositional Skewer")>>

You can use the Superpositional Skewer to touch the load with one end, then walk to the desired location, then tap yourself with the other end. This will result in you being transported back to the location of the loads and the load being transported to the destination. This effectively means you don't need to carry any heavy weights and only need to walk half the distance. This dramatically improves the efficiency of this job, allowing you to move up to 20 loads per day on your own!<</if>>

You'll be redoing the paint on a number of buildings throughout the city, where the paint is old or worn. You get 1 dubloom for every 1 square km of building surface you paint, maximum 80 dubloons. You get a basic paint roller to do the job with, but you'll get docked pay (possibly extending to an outright fine) if you get significant levels of paint in an area you weren't assigned to cover.

You have obtained $cityPaintDubloons dubloons out of 80 dubloons max for this job.

You can use the Zelus Band to make sure you stay focused. While this doesn't make you inherently any better at painting, you will find that being perfectly focused on a task like this can allow you to accomplish much more than you would otherwise. If you choose to wear the Zelus Band, you can earn up to 3 dubloons per day while working on this job alone.<</if>><<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Red Thread Flourish")>>

You can use the Red Thread Flourish to serve as additional hands to paint surfaces according to your will. The threads can move intricately and significantly increase the speed at which you can paint on your own. If you use the Red Thread Flourish while painting, you can earn up to 5 dubloons per day while working this job alone.<</if>>

You'll be generating some energy to power the city, to be stored in case all of the hundreds of Miasma-based generator, and the emergency secondary backup generator all go out at once... Yeah, this is pointless. You'll get 4 dubloons per kWh of energy you generate, up to 80 dubloons. For this job you'll get one human-sized hamster wheel hooked up to a dynamo and energy storage unit. At a constant, sustainted, fast running pace, it'll probably take well over a full day to generat e1 kWh, and you'll need to eat and drink food and water worth much more than the energy you produce. You don't need to use the hamster wheel if you don't want to, energy from a different source can be fed into storage too.

You have obtained $energyGenDubloons dubloons out of 80 dubloons max for this job.

An average human working a full day at this task can make 2 dubloons per day doing this job.<<if $playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Weakling") || $playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Minish-ish") && !$playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Colossal-able")>> However, due to your weak body, you cannot generate any significant amount of energy by running on the hamster wheel on your own. You'll need to either assign a companion to work this job alone or use a Relic to make any progress.<</if>><<if $playerCurses.some(e => e.name === "Colossal-able")>> However, due to your enormous size, you can simply use your enormous hands to rapidly spin the hamster wheel and generate a large amount of energy.

By attaching fans to the hamster wheel and blowing it with the Breathless Exhale, you can generate much more energy with much less effort than you could by running yourself. This method could generate up to 4 kWh per day, yielding 16 dubloons per day of using the Breathless Exhale to power the wheel.<</if>><<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Toral Wave")>>

The Toral Wave generate a significant amount of energy on its own, and you should be able to find a wire to connect it to the battery realtively easily within this city. Because the maximum output of the Toral Wave is 3000 W, you can generate 3kWh per hour you use it. So in only 1 day of "work" you can generate the full 20 kWh to get 80 dubloons, without needing to do much work yourself, though you do need to stay nearby to correct occasional disconnections and errors.<</if>>

	The strength of this Curse takes you by surprise. our penis surges to full erection and continues to grow in size. The base, shaft, and tip swell at a disconcerting rate. Drops of precum ooze from the tip like thick honey, yet the growth doesn't cease. 

	Finally, the curse releases its grip, but your jaw drops in disbelief as you realize you now possess a $app.penisCor cm long member. The erection lingers for a while longer, and adapting to such a massive endowment without it hindering your movement will surely demand practice. You wince from a pinching sensation as you awkwardly hobble forward.

<<elseif $app.penisCor<1 && $app.breastsCor==0>>
	The strength of this Curse takes you by surprise. Your nipples protrude like taut pencil erasers, and tiny streams of milk seep out as an intense pressure and stretching sensation engulfs your breasts. Your swelling bosom strains against your skin, momentarily as taut as overinflated balloons. The skin stretches to accommodate the expanding mass, and the dribbles of milk evolve into three powerful squirts before the ordeal ends.

	You gawk at your new $app.breastsLabel cup breasts, and even your heavy breathing sends tremors through them. You wonder if bras exist that can support such a voluptuous transformation. Surely they must, but you feel off-balance as you teeter forward.

<<else>>
	You are overwhelmed by sensation as the Curse grips you, and you fall to the ground. Your back arches as your penis springs to full erection, and bulges ever larger. Your nipples jut out like pencil erasers and small dribbles of milk start to come out of them as an intense pressure and a stretching sensation fills your breasts. The base, the shaft, the tip of your penis are swelling to an alarming degree and drops of precum start oozing out of the tip. As your breasts swell to gargantuan proportions, the dribbles of milk turn into periodic gushes. Then, finally, the curse releases its grip. 
	
	You stare slackjawed down at yourself as you realize you're now sporting a $app.penisCor inch long dong, which is throbbing in sync with your pulse, between your two heaving $app.breastsLabel cup breasts. This is a pretty dramatic change to your body. You just lie there on the ground for a minute coming to grips with what has just happened to you.

The Abyss exerts its pressure on your body, penetrating beneath your skin and targeting your once-proud muscles. Your arms, legs, and core – each part of your body that you developed by carrying supplies through the Abyss – wither away as if taunting you for your efforts. 

As your muscles dissolve before your eyes, your skin tightens, molding itself smoothly around your newly slender limbs. A feeling of being akin to a delicate doll washes over you, accompanied by a gut-wrenching realization that your current state may be permanent. 

Bereft of your former strength, you find yourself vulnerable and reliant on others. The urgency to forge and maintain close bonds becomes a necessity as you navigate this new reality.

		You briefly feel the touch of the Abyss on you, and then nothing. Then, several minutes later, the first of the random orgasms grips you. 
		
		Your body goes tense as pleasure wells up inside you, sets your skin to tingling, and the power of the Abyss drags you over the edge. Only, something is off. There must be some interaction with the Refractory Refactorization curse because your orgasm continues relentlessly. Wave after wave crashes over you, leaving you writhing on the ground, back arched in pleasure, tongue lolling out, eyes rolled back. 
		
		After what feels like an eternity but is likely only five minutes, the storm finally subsides. You stretch languidly on the ground, uncaring of the mess between your legs. Slowly, you regain your senses and realize the implications: you'll experience this publicly, and people will undoubtedly judge.

		This time, the random orgasm comes swiftly. Your body tenses as pleasure swells within you, your skin tingles, and the Abyss's power drags you into ecstasy. You're left wide-eyed, flushed, and panting, your body a sticky mess. With multiple random orgasms each day, planning your life around them is nearly impossible.

Like the last time you took this curse, the interaction with the Refractory Refactorization curse is prominent. Your orgasm continues relentlessly, waves of pleasure crashing over you, forcing you to roll on the ground, back arched, tongue lolling, eyes rolled back. You keep cumming and cumming.

		 Your lower body is a mess of sexual fluids, but you don't even care right now. Gradually, the second round of random orgasms fades. A mix of excitement and dread fills you as you contemplate your new reality. You simultaneously fear and crave the next random orgasm that will overwhelm you.

You have no choice, you gain consciousness a few times to see yourself in a surgery room where your organic parts are replaced with reliable, mechanical alternatives. But you don't fully regain consciousness until you've been fully subdued and are ready to become a productive piece of the machinery of the city.
