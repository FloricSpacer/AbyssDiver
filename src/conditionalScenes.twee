<<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Phoenix Obol")>>
	The Abyss has proven to much for you. You feel your life fade as you close your eyes for a final time.

	But suddenly, you startle awake again! You look around at your surroundings, and see that you're utterly alone and completely naked in an otherworldly white void that extends in every direction as you can see. The glow is not overly bright, but seems to pierce you in a way which is both unique and hard to describe. As if the light permeated your essence, rather than just illuminating your view. But before you have a chance to think too deeply about the situation, you feel a warm sensation in your clenched hand.

	You open your hand to see a single medallion resting on your palm, the Phoenix Obol. It has begun to glow. It's a bright, piercing light which matches the otherworldly ambience of the white void. Eventually, the glow grows so intense it becomes nearly blinding and the warm sensation grows into a burning one.

	The light flashes and the heat sears your hand, blinding you for a moment.

	Then you recover and find yourself once again in a new place. But this is one that you've been to before.

	You have avoided eating for a few days, but eventually starved to death. If you didn't realize what had happened, you can avoid this fate by pressing the back arrow in the top left until you reach the main part of a layer. Once you are there, you can take the habitation option for the current layer to avoid death.

	You managed to survive without water for a few days, but eventually died of dehydration. If you didn't realize what had happened, you can avoid this fate by pressing the back arrow in the top left until you reach the main part of a layer. Once you are there, you can take the habitation option for the current layer to avoid death.
<<elseif $SemenDemonBalance < -14>>
	Your hunger for sexual fluids was not without risks in the end. You couldn't keep up the amount of fluids your body was now requiring and in the end you collapsed. If you didn't realize what had happened, you can avoid this fate by pressing the back arrow in the top left until you reach the main part of a layer. Once you are there, you can take the habitation option for the current layer to avoid death.
<<else>>
	The horrors of the Abyss were simply too much for you. Perhaps better equipment, different companions, or a totally new approach to the encounter that ended your life could have saved you.
<</if>>
<<if $corruption < 0>>
	Due to your negative corruption, you are unable to accept a habitation option at this time. However, you can go back to the main part of the layer, then take Curses until you have reached a corruption above 0 to survive. This is highly recommended if you wish to avoid death.
<</if>>

:: BrokerEnd
YOU MAY NOT ALLOW YOUR CORRUPTION TO GO BELOW 0 DUE TO YOUR BROKER'S DEAL.

You have chosen to accept the deal of the Empty-handed Broker and attempted to take an action that would reduce your corruption points below 0. Because this is not possible, you must go back to avoid performing this action.

If you would still like to perform this action, you may go back to the main part of the layer you were on and accept Curses to raise your corruption point total.

	<<say $companionLily>>Remember, it's 'Mommy' for you now.<</say>>
	You look down bashfully.

	<<say $mc>>Yes, Mommy<</say>>
	The robot addresses Lily.

	<<say $babyCollectionUnit>>Are you the official guardian of this individual?<</say>>
	<<say $companionLily>>Let's just say I am. What's needed to stop the extraction?<</say>>
	<<say $babyCollectionUnit>>An intention document must be signed immediately to halt extraction procedures.<</say>>

	<<say $babyCollectionUnit>>Summary of document of intention on gaurdianship: You will assume full guardianship of the subject designated for extraction. You will thereby assume all legal rights and obligations of the subject. In legal terms the subject will be your under your guardianship until the subject is deemed mature again by a committee, of which you will be a member. This document is valid for only 60 days and a full document of guardianship must be signed in Outset Town by that time to avoid subject extraction. Please read the full document to obtain the details. Sign at the bottom of the document.<</say>>

	<<say $mc>>Lily! You can't be serious! Please tell me you didn't just sign my rights away.<</say>>
	She smiles and pats you on the head.

	<<say $companionLily>>It's Mommy, officially now, remember?<</say>>

:: AgeEnd1
<<say $mc>>Okay, take me back to Outset Town.<</say>>
You're gently nestled into the small bed inside the robot. As you lay there, the enclosing hatch shushes shut. A hum fills your ears, and before you know it, the hatch springs open. You're greeted by a bespectacled woman who peers down with a blend of concern and kindness.

<<say $rndF>>Don't worry, dear, I'm here to guide you. We'll sort through some necessary paperwork, and then there'll be new friends for you to meet.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>But... I don't understand.<</say>>
<<say $rndF>>That's alright. Let the grown-ups handle everything.<</say>>
You're led to a quaint room where the woman and a serious-looking man ask you a series of questions.

s time goes on, you grasp that you're now part of the Outset Town Daycare, managed by the municipality. Soon, you join others who, like you, once were divers but now appear and act no older than toddlers.

Days blur as you hope for a resolution. It's a fellow "toddler" who finally approaches you.

<<say $rndM>>Still holding out hope for someone to pick you up? I hate to break it to you, but we're here for the foreseeable future.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>That's impossible!<</say>>
<<say $rndM>>It was hard for me too. We've lost all legal rights. We're under the municipality's care until they deem us grown-up enough.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>No! I need to get out of here as soon as I can!<</say>>
<<say $rndM>>I understand. But blending in helps. The kids here, or well, most of them, play not because they've forgotten, but to cope and to hope for an earlier release.<</say>>
You sigh heavily, processing the reality.

<<say $rndM>>I get it. Maybe you want to join me in doing something to take your mind of it, trust me, that's better for your mental health.<</say>>
You look down, still in shock upon learning what your immediate future holds for you.

<<say $mc>>Fine, let's try.<</say>>
Your new friend hands you crayons, and together you embark on simple yet comforting activities. This becomes your new, albeit temporary, life.

:: AgeEnd2
The world blurs around you as Lily brings you back up to the surface with an urgency that's palpable. You barely have time to process the sudden shift in your life as you find yourself in the municipality building. And before you know it, Lily is signing the documents.

That night, a melancholic wave envelops you as you lie in bed, pondering over your lost freedom and the abrupt end to your grand adventure. You feel a soft touch, as Lily gently cradles you and runs her fingers through your hair.

<<say $companionLily>>Is something bothering you? Talk to me, Sweety.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>I feel... trapped. Like I've lost a part of me with those papers.<</say>>
Lily starts to laugh.

<<say $companionLily>>You think that paper holds power? That was more to tease you, and so you finally know your role.<</say>>
She gives you a sly grin and winks at you.

<<say $mc>>But that document is legally binding!<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>Don't throw a tantrum, Sweety, trust me. It's just some papers in a building.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>But those papers took away my legal rights!<</say>>
Lily just smiles.

<<say $mc>>It's not just about the papers. Our adventure in the Abyss... it ended too soon."<</say>>
<<say $companionLily>>Who said our adventure has ended?<</say>>
Lily gives you a wink, and for a moment you think her eyes seem to be a different color. But when you blink, they're back to normal.

<<say $mc>>Wait, are you really an angel?!<</say>>
Lily giggles at your surprise.

<<say $companionLily>>I told you when we first met, didn't I! And well, maybe I'm not exactly an angel, but what I do know is that you're my little angel now! And we can still have plenty of fun together.<</say>>
With that, a whole new chapter of your life begins, with your new Mommy there to guide you through it.

<<set $MaximCycleT_flag = false>>
A sudden, gut-wrenching pain surges from the depths of your abdomen, like a balloon bursting inside your stomach.<br><br>

<<say $mc>>Aaaahhhhh!<</say>><br>

You crumple to the ground, gasping for air, as the sensation of countless tiny feet scuttling and skittering consumes you from the inside. A cold sweat breaks on your forehead, and every inhale feels like drawing breath through a narrow straw.<br><br>

A horrifying realization strikes you – the parasite's gestation period is ending. An overwhelming pressure builds within you as countless Chasm Crawlers push against your insides, eager to emerge. As you writhe in agony, a gruesome cocktail of bodily fluids and hundreds of squirming, worm-like creatures pour from your $mc.getCurse(TheMaxim).location, seeking freedom.<br><br>

The violent chaos ends as suddenly as it began, leaving you drained and weak on the damp ground. Somehow, an eerie sense of emptiness consumes you. But deep down, an unsettling truth remains: the cycle is bound to commence anew.<br>
<br>

<b>Because of the violent nature of the "birth", your next 3 travel times will be increased by 1 day each as your body recovers.</b><br><br>

From the horizon, a familiar silhouette emerges, steadily approaching your camp. It's Vesper, the bandit you released just days before.<br><br>
<<say $mc>>Vesper? Is that really you? What brings you back to us?<</say>><br>
<<say $companionBandit>>Life's strange turns, I suppose. I thought a lot after we last met, and... well, here I am.<</say>><br>
Her usual fierce demeanor softens, and she appears almost hesitant.<br><br>

<<say $mc>>I'm surprised you managed to find us. We've traveled quite a distance since our last encounter. Were you trailing us?<</say>><br>
Caught off guard, Vesper's cheeks tint with a light shade of pink.<br><br>
<<say $companionBandit>>No! I just... happened to end up here. Call it fate or just dumb luck.<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>That's quite the coincidence. But regardless...<</say>><br>

:: Bound Bandit Ending
You're dragged back to the bandit's hideout on the first layer. On the way there, your new captor was displeased to learn that the body switch was permanent.

Before long, you arrived at the bandit hideout. At first, your captor was almost assaulted by the rest of the bandits, in an attempt to take revenge and free you. Unfortunately for you, your captor managed to convince the rest of them of your true identities.

Your life was essentially over from that point. Initially, you were kept in bounds, but they soon chained you to the wall in your captor's room in the hideout, so you had a small amount of movement. Your captor's frustration at not being able to return to her body remained for a long time.

She would comment that she had the perfect seductive body with which to con and rob travelers, without them even noticing what was happening And you apparently ruined that. At some point, her frustration was replaced by an obsession, and she began to become more and more interested in groping you. In the end, she came to terms with her new body. In her mind, she traded it for her freedom. And, of course, a hot sex slave.

Unfortunately for you, you have become the sex slave in this story, which made the rest of your life less about adventuring, and more about licking, slurping, and getting filled every day by your new captor and her compatriots.

<</nobr>>

You open your eyes and realize your body feels undescribably strange, almost as if it weren't there at all. It takes a moment to remember slipping into that pond, but your eyes feel heavy and it's a large effort to make yourself get up. But the effort doesn't make a difference, and when your eyes are finally open you still don't see anything, as if you are blindfolded. You try to get pull off the blindfold but you can't seem to grab it. You can't even feel it on your face.

In fact, you can't even feel your arms.

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_annoyed.png">> <<say $companionAI>> What the fuck is this?<</say>>
Just as you start to wonder how your voice sounds you hear a scream. You feel as if you are moved around while simultaneously not feeling anything at all. It's very disorienting, making it hard to keep track of what's going on.

<<say $mc>> I'm real! I'm real! I'm actually real!<</say>>
Suddenly you feel yourself moving even more and light finally streams into your eyes, and you see... yourself?

<<say $mc>> You actually did it! You actually did it! This is amazing, thank you so much!<</say>>
And then it dawns on you what must have happened.

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_mortified.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Oh no... Did I actually switch with you?! I didn't think it would really work.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> I know, me neither! But I'm so glad you tried! This is going to be awesome.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_shocked.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Oh my fucking... I actually lost my body? Now what am I? A virtual avatar? What the hell am I going to do? You tricked me into this!<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Slow down sister, I didn't trick you into anything. I just pondered on if it was possible and you went ahead yourself and tried it.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_crying.png">> <<say $companionAI>> I don't want this anymore, Ai. I want my body back. You stole my body, give it back.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Wow wow, don't go all panic mode on me, okay? I'm not some evil AI that wants to snatch everybody's body and take over the world. I just want to have some fun. So how about we just have some fun today, and then we'll switch back afterwards? Maybe you like all the power that comes with being a high-tech AI and we can do this more often!<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_bummed.png">> <<say $companionAI>> Okay, maybe it's not so bad to be an AI for a little bit.<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_neutral_happy.png">> <<say $companionAI>> I do look pretty cute now!<</say>>
<<say $mc>> You bet your cute little rear of yours that you do!<</say>>
<<say $companionAI>> Yeah, let's just enjoy the experience and then change back tonight! Can we go back into the Fate-Crossing Star pond and switch back?<</say>>
<<say $mc>> I don't know, you're the one with the data on the Abyss now.<</say>>
<<say $companionAI>> Oh right! So how do I access this data on the Abyss...<</say>>
The moment you start thinking about the data of the Abyss, you start to remember that the Abyss has a certain origin, exits and nine layers. When you focus your thought on the layers, you feel yourself remembering the second layer more specifically. Remembering the second layer in turn floods your head with new memories on the threats, Relics, biome, lay-out until you remember the wonders and start focussing on those, more specifically the Fate-Crossing Star. You go over all the information you suddenly remembered about it.

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_shocked.png">> <<say $companionAI>>... <</say>>
<<say $mc>> Did you access the data?<</say>>
<<say $companionAI>>Yes... It only works one time.<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Oh, that's inconvenient, I guess you'll be a virtual sister for a bit longer.<</say>>
She giggles, sounding strange with her mannerisms coming out of your mouth.

<<say $mc>> Anyway, where do we need to go to reverse this?<</say>>
You frantically start going through all the data, layer by layer, all Wonders, all Curses, all Relics but nothing with body swapping properties shows up.

<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_mortified.png">> <<say $companionAI>>I    can't    find    anything... <</say>>
You start to feel very tired all of a sudden.

<<say $mc>> Whoa, slow down, you're overclocking the yourself quite a bit. You're draining your battery and if you're not careful you'll damage your system!<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_crying.png">> <<say $companionAI>>There has to be a way, there has to be! <</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_clueless.png">> <<say $companionAI>>Wait a second! When you proposed this, you must surely have known a way to reverse this, right Ai? <</say>>
<<say $mc>> Well, not really. You didn't ask about, so I can't remember even looking for that data<</say>>
<<set $companionAI.imageIcon= "Icons/Ai_angry.png">> <<say $companionAI>>What do you mean I didn't ask about it? Is this a joke to you?<</say>>
Ai seems to frown as well.

<<say $mc>> Yeah, actually it sort of was. You were the person who took the joke one step further and stepped into a magical pond, remember? I didn't plan for this to happen at all, I don't have access to all the data all the time. I'm high-tech, not an omniscient god. This was not my choice nor even what I wanted to happen!<</say>>
You calm yourself down as realize Ai is right, you'll need her to fix this. If this is even fixable at all.

And so a new adventure starts. But this time you aren't the main character, this time, you're the sidekick. You keep sifting through the data and find that in the deepest part of the Abyss there may be a possible solution, but it would be quite the journey to get there. Ai does her best to descend through the Abyss as far as possible, but it continually gets tougher to traverse with each layer, and her decision to swap back with you wavers. 

At first Ai consulted you about which Curses she would take, but over time she began to take more and more Curses of her own accord. Changing "your" body to that of a small, pink-haired girl. When you complained about it she brushed you off, telling you that she also needs to feel comfortable in her... your body. As time went on, you felt less and less sure that you would reach the bottom of the Abyss. Moreover, would Ai even want to change back at that point?

Until then, the best you can do is brief Ai on the ins and outs of the Abyss and hope her adventure reaches a conclusion you can also live with.

But unfortunately, this is no longer your story, it's hers.

:: Maxim Bad End
The moment you determine to rid yourself of the parasite, an uneasy sensation crawls over you, as if the Chasm Crawler knows your intentions.

<<say $mc>>I have to extract this parasite, now!<</say>>
A searing pain suddenly pierces your spine, radiating outwards like molten lava coursing through your nervous system. Your muscles spasm, making it almost impossible to control your movements.

<<say $mc>>I... have... to... keep... moving!<</say>>
With a surge of adrenaline, you manage to lift one arm, but just as quickly, another arm rises of its own volition.

<<say $mc>>Wha... why is my... arm...?<</say>>
Your speech becomes muffled, words slurring together in a grotesque symphony of lost control. Panic surges as you watch your hands contort and twitch, not by your own command.

<<say $mc>>I can... I can... fight this!<</say>>
But the voice that emerges isn't yours. It's cold, calculated, dripping with malevolence. Your body abruptly turns, moving in the opposite direction of your intended destination. Desperation and terror churn within you, yet your body remains alarmingly calm.

You scream internally, trying to reclaim your body, but the more you resist, the tighter the Chasm Crawler's grip becomes.

<<say $mc>>Hush now, host. Resist, and I will erase your very essence. Cooperate, and perhaps there's a sliver of hope for you yet.<</say>>
You're trapped, a silent observer within the confines of your own flesh and bone, as the parasite navigates the Abyssal terrain with your body.

You feel a sudden, sharp pain in your lower abdomen as your muscles begin to contract. The pain is intense and comes in waves, radiating from your belly down to your legs. You feel a hot, sweaty sensation all over your body as your skin becomes slick with perspiration.

Your breathing becomes rapid and shallow as you try to keep up with the contractions. You hear your own gasps and moans as you push through the pain. You feel pressure in your lower region, as if your body is trying to force something out.

	<<say $mc>>Oh, right... I'm really sorry about that.<</say>><br>
	<<say $companionMaru>>It's just that, well... am I... are we expecting? Because this...<</say>><br>
	Maru's hands gently caress his slightly rounded belly, his expression a mixture of awe and concern.<br><br>
	<<say $mc>>Yes, I'm afraid you're right.<</say>><br>
	A troubled frown creases Maru's brow as he processes the news.<br><br>
	<<say $companionMaru>>I see. So, this is truly happening to me. Why didn't you say something earlier?<</say>><br>
	<<say $mc>>The situation was already pretty complicated, I didn't know how to bring it up.<</say>><br>
	Maru's gaze falls once again, his disappointment palpable.<br><br>
	<<say $companionMaru>>I understand, but a heads-up would have been appreciated.<</say>><br>

	<<say $mc>>For you, Lily? Always!<</say>><br>
	<<say $companionLily>>It's about the body you left me with, and what I've inherited in return.<</say>><br>

	<<say $mc>>I was still figuring things out...<</say>><br>

	<<say $companionKhemia>>You better start making sense, and quick.<</say>><br>
	<<say $mc>>What do you mean?<</say>><br>
	<<say $companionKhemia>>Food's a mess, I'm always hungry, and don't get me started on these damn sensitive nipples. What did you do to this body?<</say>><br>

	<<say $companionKhemia>>But it's getting worse! I'm always tired, and look at this! I'm huge!<</say>><br>
	Khemia pats his swollen belly, a look of discomfort crossing his face.<br><br>
	<<say $companionKhemia>>And then there's this weird feeling inside. It's like... tickling. I wasn't this big before, so what's happening?<</say>><br>
	<<say $mc>>Well, you do have a... condition.<</say>><br>
	<<say $companionKhemia>>I knew something was off. So, you can fix it?<</say>><br>

	<<say $mc>>It would appear so.<</say>><br>
	<<say $companionKhemia>>Unbelievable! Not only do I get stuck in a woman's body, but a pregnant one? And you couldn't even warn me?<</say>><br>

:: Gestation Scene1 [nobr]
The morning light barely filters through your window as consciousness seeps back into you. But with wakefulness comes a profound sense of change. Your limbs feel unusually heavy, and a deep lethargy grips your body. You sit up, feeling an unfamiliar weight pulling at your midsection. Glancing down, your eyes widen in surprise at the sight of your belly, now rounded and pronounced, unmistakably that of middle stage pregnancy.<br>

<<say $mc>>AAAAHHH! What the... how can I be this pregnant already?! This can't be real!<</say>><br>
Your hands tremble as you pinch your skin, hoping against hope that this is just a dream. But the firm swell of your belly under your fingers tells you otherwise. You pace back and forth, a hand instinctively cradling the new curve of your abdomen, your mind racing with disbelief and a growing sense of panic.<br><br>

<<if $menFirstCycle>>
	<<say $mc>>I'm a man, this shouldn't be possible! How did this happen?<</say>><br>
	Gradually, as the initial shock ebbs away, memories of the choices you made, the paths you walked, begin to resurface. You pause, taking a deep, steadying breath, and a sliver of acceptance pierces through the confusion.<br><br>
	<<say $mc>>This is my reality now... The only way is forward.<</say>><br>

<<else>>
	<<say $mc>>Ah shit...<</say>><br>
	You exhale deeply, the sound mingling with the quiet of the room.<br><br>
	<<say $mc>>I knew being pregnant would be a journey, but this... At least I got to skip the morning sickness.<</say>><br>
<</if>>

As you stand, your movements are cautious, almost reverent, as you adjust to the new balance of your body. The mirror reflects a version of you that seems both foreign and intimately familiar, the gentle bulge of your belly a testament to the rapid changes your body is going through.<br><br>

:: Gestation Scene2 [nobr]
Dawn greets you with a challenge. As you attempt to rise from bed, it feels like an immense effort. Your body no longer responds with its usual agility; instead, you find yourself rolling, maneuvering around the significant expanse of your belly, which has grown substantially overnight.<br><br>

<<say $mc>>Damn, here we go again. This is the last time it'll take me by surprise.<</say>><br>
You attempt to dress, only to find that your clothes are now hopelessly inadequate for your enlarged form. Fabric strains and stitches protest. But eventually, you're able to somewhat adapt your clothing to fit your new frame.<br><br>

The curve of your belly is now pronounced and undeniable, a symbol of life accelerating within you. You place a hand gently over your baby bump, feeling a mix of wonder and trepidation at the thought of giving birth to a child soon.<br><br>

:: Doll event [surface]

<<say $creepydoll>> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<</say>>
A sudden sensation of intense pain surges through your body, making you double over. It feels as if your body has been engulfed by flames that sear each and every nerve in your skin, while a thousand needles are pushed deeper into you, all at once. Almost immediately, it becomes too much for you and you pass out.

:: Doll event continued[surface]
You wake up in a corner of the Relic Workshop with the doll clutched tightly in your arms, pressed against your chest. It gives a pleasantly warm feeling, comforting you after your terrifying experience before you passed out. Somehow, as you hug the doll, you feel calm and satisfied for at least a moment. When you look down and check your skin, everything seems alright, no scars or burns anywhere. Luckily it seems that your body has not actually been torn apart, instead it was either a psychic attack of some sort or a vision of a possible future. Whatever the case, perhaps its better to not proceed with the plan to cut open the doll.

:: DollWarning 
<<CarryAdjust>>
Suddenly, you start hearing the voice of the doll again, it almost sounds like it's coming from inside your own head.

<<say $creepydoll>> Don't you sometimes get tired of all this adventuring?<</say>>
Despite your surprise, you decide to answer the doll's question.

<<say $mc>> Sometimes, I guess. It's not always easy, but the thrill of adventure more than makes up for it to me. <</say>>
<<say $creepydoll>> You know, I can feel what you feel? And what I felt was sleepiness and tired thoughts and lots of doubt. Don't lie to me. Lying is not nice. Good girls don't lie. Only BAD people lie. IF YOU LIE YOU NEED TO GET PUNISHED. I HATE LIARS! HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE THEM<</say>>
A strong, cold chill runs down your spine.

<<say $mc>>I... I'm not lying I swear! It's just that with the changes to my body I fatigue much quicker than before. I have to try harder and harder to do the same things. But I swear that I still want to discover more of the Abyss. I can't just give up and I won't! I think it's worth it and I enjoy it!<</say>>
The cold sensation dissipates and you feel a warm, soft aura coming from the doll once again.

<<say $creepydoll>> Oh, I see! You just want to have fun! I also want to have fun! You know what doesn't make you sleepy and is super fun?<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Uh, no? <</say>>
<<say $creepydoll>> Playing games, silly. We should go to my house and play all day! That would be super fun! <</say>>
You're a bit hesitant about going to god-forsaken corner of the Abyss to "play", so you try to weasel out of it while attempting to avoid the doll's anger.

<<say $mc>>Maybe that could be fun someday, okay?<</say>>
<<say $creepydoll>> Yay, I'm so happy! Because today is some day you know?<</say>>
<<say $mc>> Um, sorry, I didn't mean today. I meant another day...<</say>>
You feel very tired all of a sudden and your consciousness starts to slip away.

You start to dream.

You see yourself walking around with your dolly and at some point you recognize the outskirts of Outcast Village as you seem to pass it by. The next moment, you are in a playroom, in a house wearing a similar dress as your dolly. You look so cute together! You have tea time with her and you run around playing tag.

It's so much fun you can hardly keep track of what's happening.<<nobr>>
<<dollTF>>
<</nobr>>
As you run, you trip over something that somehow didn't seem to fully be there. The shock suddenly wakes you up, and you realize you fell over a rotting, collapsed wooden support beam. After looking around, you find yourself not in the playroom of a nice house, but in the decrepit room on the first layer where you found the creepy doll.

<<say $creepydoll>> Aww, did you have an ouchie?<</say>>
<<say $mc>> What...? Where am I? Why are we here? Why am I wearing this tattered dress?<</say>>
<<say $creepydoll>> Because it makes us look like cute twins!<</say>>
<<say $mc>> I... I don't want this. Or at least, I think I don't?<</say>>
<<say $creepydoll>> Oh somebody is grumpy, so why don't you take a nap, and then we'll decide later?<</say>>

<<say $mc>> I'd rather really not. To be honest, I just want to get my regular clothes back, to leave this place, and to go somewhere else. <</say>><br>
<<say $creepydoll>> Hmm, that's okay. We already played a lot today. We'll just play some other time. Soon...<</say>>
You scramble to get your clothes and hurry out of the rotten house, leaving this place and the doll far behind. Once there is some distance between you and the doll, you stop to change your clothes. But instead of grabbing your clothes, you find the doll in your hands, once again.

<<say $mc>> What?! How?! I'm pretty sure I grabbed my clothes, right?<</say>><br>
<<say $creepydoll>> Those smelly old things? Why would you need those? You look much better than this, you silly. Now we are cute twinsies. ISN'T THAT FUN?<</say>>
You want to throw the doll away, but your body simply refuses. At the moment it seems there is nothing you can do. No matter what you want to do, you can neither get rid of the doll, nor change your clothes.

:: Starlit Unlocked
Emerging onto the surface, the first thing you feel is the comforting warmth of the sunlight caressing your face, a stark contrast to the gloom below. As you linger momentarily, savoring the radiant glow and the fresh air, a symphony of mechanical sounds erupts behind you.

Turning, you witness the once dormant Starlit Conquest unfolding itself into a towering stance. The mech's head, now animated, beams with two bright headlights that mimic the intense gaze of a vigilant sentinel. Their brightness, almost blinding, pierces the daylight with an otherworldly glow.

For a fleeting moment, awe and disbelief grip you as the gargantuan construct, a marvel of engineering and imagination, stirs to life. The mech's Adamantium chassis gleams under the sun, reflecting light like a polished mirror. The sounds of gears and hydraulics in motion meld with a subtle hum of energy emanating from its core, creating an orchestra of power and precision.

As you stand there, absorbing the grandeur of the moment, a profound realization washes over you. The Starlit Conquest, an embodiment of boundless potential and strength, has awakened. And now, it awaits your command, ready to soar the skies or delve into the cosmos under your guidance.
