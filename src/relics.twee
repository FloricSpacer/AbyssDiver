:: Star Compass Description
An orb filled with a clear liquid. No matter how you turn it in your hands, the needle inside always points down! It's nice to look at, so you can probably sell it for a bit even though it doesn't do much.


:: RÃ¸mer Stones Description
A collection of 5 small rocks. When kept separate, they're an inexhaustible heat sponge, cooling their surroundings and being capable of slowly freezing water. Keeping more of them together gradually increases their ambient heat, and all five of them together are warm enough to be slightly uncomfortable in your hand.


:: Creepy Doll Description
A really weird doll; any person would feel uncomfortable and try to look away if they stared at it for more than five seconds. Unclear if it's a magic thing or if it's just a really creepy doll.


:: Giddy Reaper Description
Any living plants cut with this sickle will grow back to their previous height in the same spot (relative to the planet you're on) in only 12 hours, even if the sickle were to completely tear apart the plant and not a single cell remained - so long as soil remains in that spot. Unsuitable as a weapon.


:: Silk Twister Description
A comb that can be run absentmindedly through any hair to instantly grow it or shrink it to the length the user desires, and style it to their liking.


:: Vertebra Key Description
Can lock anything that has a keyhole, but can only unlock things that are generally recognized as owned by the wielder.


:: Chain of Lorelei Description
When worn as a choker, gives the wearer a heavenly voice, easily appealing enough to make a career out of. Also increases talent with musical instruments.


:: Hive Tassel Description
A small scrap of cloth that vibrates whenever bees are nearby - will probably become less useful as the years go by. Smells and tastes strongly of honey, but you probably shouldn't eat it.


:: Smitten Mitt Description
When worn on the hand, gives the wearer the realistic sensation of holding a soft, comforting human hand. Magically calms nerves and anxiety; doesn't cause dependency or anything like that.


:: Firmament Pigment Description
A bucket containing about 5 liters of bluish paint. Painting things with it causes them to automatically take on the pattern of a starry night sky, which even seems to glimmer and shine in an animated fashion. Close inspection would reveal that the pattern is in fact an accurate depiction of the section of the night sky directly above the painted object (the zenith), updating if it moves far enough or enough time passes for the apparent positions of stars to change. Compatible with nearly any kind of surface.

Additionally, the liquid form of the paint is very flammable and can be easily and rapidly ignited by heat or an open flame, while the dried form is extremely flame-resistant. Refills from empty to full over a 24 hour period.


:: Pearly Gates Description
A small toothbrush. Brushing with it just once will keep your teeth permanently clean and healthy, as well as keep your overall oral health essentially perfect, for the rest of your life. Also keeps your breath fresh in a flavor of either mint, cinnamon, lavender, blueberry, orange, or cherry, of your choosing (can be changed by brushing once more.)


:: World Stone Description
A small barbell that changes its weight to match the user's goals and capabilities. Using it to exercise will cause fat to burn and muscle to build at roughly five times the normal rate. With a great deal of hard work and diligence, this can allow you to surpass normal human limits, but only slightly - All Might-style super strength isn't attainable with this. Without diligence, it can instead be used to keep your body in good shape with just a modicum of effort.

Might not be the best use of time and calories down in the Abyss if you don't have a specific goal in mind.

While it has a variable weight ranging from 5 to 500 kg, it only weighs 5 kg when not being held.


:: Forest's Gift Description
A simple necklace that allows you to talk to non-human animals, and makes them much more friendly towards you. It won't protect you from particularly violent animals intent on hurting you (like every beast in the Threats section), though it will be the difference between a stray cat biting you or snuggling up to your lap. If you form a strong friendship with some animals, they may even work to try and protect you from danger.


:: Harmless Harmony Description
This harp can be played by strumming its 'strings' of concentrated light. It also plays itself when nobody else plays it, always playing a perfectly suitable background tune for the surrounding situation. Soothing music when you're troubled, dramatic music when you'd like to make a powerful entrance, and frantic, fast-paced songs when you're in danger. It won't ever get annoying, because then it wouldn't be suitable. If there's truly no song that could enhance the mood of a situation, it'll stay silent.

Notably, the sound it produces travels cleanly through any medium. Even in a fully soundproof room, its sound would travel directly through the walls, not so much as muffled on the other side. Generally, only distance is able to dampen the volume.


:: Umbra Trident Description
A small, golden fork. The shadow cast from it physically interacts with the shadows of other objects, allowing the fork to be used to push things or pierce them from a distance via its shadow. The force given off by the shadow, as well as its piercing power, are equivalent to a normal fork, so it can't be used to do things like push large boulders or pierce iron on its own.


:: Event Horizon Description
A bracelet that, when worn, will cause all waste products within the wearer's body (solid, liquid, or gas) to automatically vanish rather than needing to be expelled, removing the need to use the restroom. Also prevents periods if applicable, while having no effect on fertility.


:: Heart-stealing Stole Description
A very stylish scarf. It also seems to blow in a dramatic fashion around the wearer, even in the lightest breeze. It has the effect of drawing others to the wearer, making them appear cool and interesting even when they're not, and often making it much easier for others to find them attractive.


:: Effacing Asperity Description
An aerosol can that sprays a lilac-colored mist that quickly becomes clear. Anything sprayed with it will, for 24 hours afterwards, experience 0.01% of the friction it would have otherwise experienced when brought in contact with any surface. The can never seems to run out of fluid no matter how much you use it.


:: Wholly Ale Description
A small chalice. Water that is poured inside can be willed to take on the color, consistency, and flavor of any mundane beverage the holder wishes. the produced drink can also be made to seemingly have whatever alcohol content the user wishes, though these effects are only seen in the intoxication of the human body after ingestion, and do not alter the composition of the liquid or make it flammable. Does not take on any other properties of the beverage. Must be a concrete substance, not a request like 'the drink that would make me happiest right now.'


:: Memoir Remnant Description
This seems to be an ordinary bookshelf at first, but after leaving books inside, it will slowly start to overwrite them with an apparent autobiography of the life of whoever last touched the shelf. On average it takes about 100 pages of a book and a week of time to write about each year of a person's life. But thus can vary a but depending on just how much happened to them that year. It starts from their birth, and if nobody new touches it and it catches up, it will eventually begin very slowly writing about the events in a person's life as they happen, so long as enough paper remains. (Books can be removed and replaced freely in the middle of the process.) It's somewhat influenced by the genre of the books it overwrites - a bookshelf of detective novels might color the autobiographies with an air of mystery and suspense, having a bunch of manga would leas to the autobiography being illustrated in their style, having a bunch of scientific textbooks would result in the tiniest minutiae of your life being examined in overwhelming technical detail, and so on.


:: Gleam Dazer Description
A charm in the shape of an eye. While in the Abyss and the surrounding area looking though it allows you to view the next layer (i.e. view the Relics, Curses, and threats available in the layer below your current one), seeing what awaits you there without actually having to make the journey down to it in a blind leap of faith. Outside of the Abyss, it has another possible use, allowing you to instantly see the next month's worth of future events from your perspective, leaving you in a position to try to change them. Whichever of the two ways you decide to use it, it breaks after one use, becoming useless. Even if you were somehow to chain multiple uses together, it couldn't be used to view an arbitrary amount of time into the future - upon gazing into it, visions of your future self gazing into the future, or any information they record from beyond the month you can see, will be blurred out and useless.


:: Sibyl Blend Description
A sachet of oolong tea leaves that never seem to lose their flavor, no matter how many times they're steeped. If left in a brewed cup (or flask or any kind of makeshift container), after drinking, the leaves will cluster towards and edge of the cup pointing towards nearby undiscovered Relics. This makes them easier to find, subtracting 1 day from all time costs for options in the Relics sections. They can also just make a very nice-tasting tea.


:: Pangea Shaker Description
A salt shaker containing a rainbow-colored powder. But sprinkling it on any edible food, it can be made to taste like any other food the user imagines, taking on the same flavor and texture and leaving non of the original food's. Also can be used to dispense any culinary herb or spice the user wishes, for more conventional cooking. Does not alter any non-aesthetic qualities of the food, and even the dispenses garnishes offer no nutritional value, though they do offer flavorful value.


:: From Seafoam Description
A sponge. When used to lightly scrub any skin, that skin will permanently remain magically clean - any filth, sweat, and germs covering it seem to just evaporate away. You can also infuse the scrubbed skin with a scent of your choosing by thinking of it while scrubbing, or forego this for a simple clean lack of scent. You can change the scent by scrubbing with it once more. Can optionally remove blemishes and scars.


:: Orbweaver Description
A vaguely spider-shaped device which expels a thick, sticky gloop when squeezed. About 10 seconds after being dispensed, it quickly hardens into a solid material nearly as hard as iron.


:: Soulseeker Description
A pair of dowsing rods that, when held in the hands, give off a small vibrations as the user moves physically closer to the one thing their heart desires most of all. this isn't susceptible to change from the user trying to consciously decide what they want most - the rods look past all the user's facades to see their true desire, and thus very rarely changes unless that desire is fulfilled. Sometimes not even then.


:: Tranquility Knell Description
A small, golden bell. When rung, all sound in a 100 meter (330 ft) radius from the bell will be reduced to 1/100 of its normal volume, for 30 minutes. Ringing the bell vigorously will end the effect early. Recharges over 24 hours.


:: Lightning Rook Description
A transparent, glassy chess piece in the shape of a rook. When held in a hand, it slows down the user's perception of time based on how long they've continuously held it, starting at 1/2 normal perception and slowly going down to 1/200 the normal perception over the course of 24 hours of continuously holding it. The effect cannot be toggled except by letting go of the rook and resetting the timer. Allows more time to make decisions, but doesn't make the holder physically move faster. Requires a great deal of patience to make full use of.


:: Acrobatic Accord Description
A thin, delicate anklet. When worn around an ankle, it grants the user significantly increased skill in their hands and feet, elevating their skill with their off-hand to make them perfectly ambidextrous, and granting their feet the kind of dexterity and usefulness that their off-hand previously had. It also increases the user's flexibility significantly, allowing them to easily move their limbs in ways that would make many wince. For those who already have high dexterity and flexibility, like circus performers, this Relic would take their skills  even further to the point of being kind of scary.


:: Managed Misfortune Description
Two small, brightly-colored marbles. Each one has the power to absorb a single Curse that you haven't yet accepted from the Abyss, allowing you to store it and activate that Curse for yourself whenever you wish, as well as deactivate it when you're done, by squeezing the marble in your hand. You must be in a Curse's particular layer to store it. Anyone else who squeezes the marbles can also gain or remove the stored Curses. Having a Curse in one of these prevents you from gaining corruption points from that Curse in any way. While on your quest, you can vigorously shake the marbles to remove the Curse stored inside and store a different one instead - this will also dispel that Curse for anyone who squeezed that marble.

The marbles will be unable to confer a Curse to someone if it contradicts a permanent Curse they already have. Age Reduction Curses stored in this Relic, unlike permanent Age Reduction Curses, only affect physical appearances - they do not actually increase lifespan, improve health, or restore youthful vigor.


:: Breathless Exhale Description
A small handheld paper fan that can be waved to send a large blast of air in the direction it was waved. probably not good for fanning yourself, as you'd be blasting yourself with a powerful air current - though a self-directed air current could be useful for bringing far away objects closer to you.

If used under a clear, unobstructed view of the sun, it grows in power, and can be used to temporarily change the direction wind is blowing in that area, Wind Waker style.


:: Sharing Shears Description
A pair of unusually sharp, bone-white porcelain scissors. If they cut completely through a single object and split it into two separate pieces, each with a mass no more than 20% different from the other, then the two pieces will be linked after 5 seconds pass, all force in newtons being applied to both objects equally. Picking up one object will cause the other the hover in the air, the you'll feel the force of gravity on both objects, and thus the weight of both. The link can be dispelled by tapping an affected object with the soft side of the scissors. the scissors can cut through most stone with a bit of effort, but would have trouble with most metals. Note that most Relics would be destroyed and become useless if cut in half.


:: Rose-tinted Spectacles Description
A pair of red-tinted glasses. Closing your left eye and looking into the left lens allows you to see 10 seconds into the future, while closing your left and looking into the right lens allows you to see 10 seconds into the past. Keeping both eyes open allows you to instantly discern whether anyone you see speaking is telling the truth or not, and the effect extends to viewing recordings, as well as to new recordings made through the lens of the glasses.


:: Ghost-righter Writing Down Description
A small, soft feather with a pen tip. If you use it to write something and then leave the work alone for 4 hours, the ink will be rearranged into new words so as to have perfect spelling and grammar, free of ambiguity or mistakes. Where appropriate, it will also upgrade the language used a great deal, into new prose that will retain the author's original intention, while also being much more descriptive, imaginative, and capable of resonating with many more people. Works with all languages, including programming languages, so long as the author at least lands in the correct ballpark for use of that language.


:: Gilded Prison Description
A large, ornate cage. When it is closed and kept still, objects inside cease undergoing natural erosion and wear-and-tear, keeping a pristine condition unless they're hit with serious destructive force. This also applies to living beings, preventing aging and many diseases (but not curing them if already present). The effect is paused if the cage is opened or moved in any significant capacity, and will only return if the cage is closed and kept still for about two minutes. An average-sized human could just barely fit in here, but it would be quite uncomfortable.

Has no effect on the spoilage of food foraged from the Abyss when moving between layers. Seems like whatever force causes that doesn't count as 'natural erosion.'


:: Omoikane Circuit Description
A small sim card-like chip that can be inserted into any model of phone. This upgrades the phone with infinite battery life, an OS specifically attuned to your thought patterns for productivity and ease of use, free infinite data a bit faster than any plan on the market, and automatically-upgrading specs about 120% as good as the best commercially available consumer electronic. (If technological standards suddenly dropped, this phone would still keep the maximum specs it had achieved.) Also comes with a cute and helpful AI assistant.

The chip can be removed and placed in another phone at any time if you get tired of the same model or need a different button layout or something, but the base phone's specs have no impact on the upgraded phone's.


:: Afar Wanderer Description
An oddly-shaped wand. When tapped twice against any single nonliving object with a volume of less than 1 cubic meter (which includes almost all Relics), this wand and that object will be linked, and moving the wand any distance in space will cause that object to move the same distance, in the same direction. Rotating this wand also causes the object to rotate in the same way. The reverse is not true, and movements of the linked object will not affect the wand. By applying pressure on different points of the wand, you can cause rotation of the wand to go out of sync with the object, or increase or decrease he distance by which the linked object travels in accordance with the wand by up to a factor of 5. With a great deal of practice this can function as single-object telekinesis.

Tapping another object twice will shift the link to the new object, or the link can be dispelled by bringing the object to the wand and using the wand to tap it thrice. Objects can remain linked up to  maximum distance of 100m (330ft.) The wand will take on the average weight of itself and whatever object it's linked to.


:: Kin Shifter Description
A glob of thick, putty-like slime. the face appears decorative. When touched to another Relic that you own, a portion of the slime will break off and reshape itself into a perfect replica of that Relic, gaining all of its characteristics, abilities, value, and weight permanently. It cannot shift back to its original form. The amount that breaks off is dependent on the perceived value of the Relic, which can be measured with its dubloon value. The slime contains 70 dubloons worth of morphing power, and can be used on multiple Relics with that total value or less - however, the last Relic that is duplicated can put you over the 70 dubloon total, so long as that Relic is worth 70 dubloons or less. This Relic can also copy Relics worth over 70 dubloons, but in that case that Relic would have to be the sole Relic that you copy.

Some examples: A : (20)->(30)->(20) = total 70, done.

B: (20)->(30)->(40) = total 90, over 70, done.

C: (120) done, only possible configuration for duplicating a Relic worth this much.


:: Brave Vector Description
A cylindrical metal pipe. Don't stick your finger in! Anything passing through the pipe becomes dramatically faster, gaining approximately 100x its entering velocity and firing straight from the other end of the pipe, even if it entered at an angle. However, it has diminishing returns for objects passing through that are already incredibly fast, like bullets - they'll still be faster, but much less so.


:: Devil's Own Description
A small charm which grants a general increase in luck. Carrying it with you isn't quite enough to win the lottery or make a consistent profit from gambling, though you should at least be able to roughly break even at the slots. What you'll notice more than anything is a dramatic decrease in unlucky occurrences - no more spilled drinks on your lap, or tripping on the sidewalk, or being caught in traffic when you're in a hurry. try not to tempt fate too much - if you bet regularly at terrible odds, you'll still lose money; if you intentionally make a lot of enemies, you'll eventually get hurt; if you run at a monster with a terrible plan, you'll still get eaten.

Having this gives you one reroll on your entire adventure with Cherry's ability. The fate attached to her is powerful and can't be influenced like this very easily.


:: Verve Cell Description
No matter how hard this hammer is swung, the force it delivers will never be anything more than a light tap. When tapped against any Relic with a charge or use time, such as Tranquility Knell or Flamel's Folly, when it is ready to activate, this hammer will store that charge and revert that Relic to its 'uncharged' state, allowing it to begin charging again. Tapping the same Relic again when its charge has been stored allow you to restore the charge to that Relic instantly. The hammer can store up to 6 charges total, potentially from different Relics.


:: Vessel Vivisector Description
A small scalpel that can be used to harmlessly and painlessly cut away a 'ghost afterimage' from a living creature, including the wielder. This ghost will appear slightly translucent, and will continue performing whatever simple task the source creature was performing at the time of the cut. The same creature can have multiple ghosts cut from it at once. A total of 6 ghosts can be active from this Relic at the same time (potentially from a mic of different creatures), and if used to cut a 7th time, the oldest ghost will vanish. The ghosts have very limited problem-solving ability, and are best used for menial, repetitive tasks. They are very delicate and easy to destroy with the slightest physical force. Held objects and Relics aren't duplicated.


:: Sated Artist Description
When this giant paintbrush is dipped into paint or any opaque liquid, it can be dragged through the air to paint solid 3-dimensional objects. Gripping the brush more tightly increases the stroke size, while gripping it very loosely will cause it to finish drawing the current object, allowing it to be affected by gravity and other forces. the solid paint-matter from this has a density of about 1g/cm3, so it has a weight roughly between wood and stone. The matter from this will have all the chemical reactions from the liquid it was painted with, but with phase-changing conditions and durability similar to iron, making it difficult to melt.

Objects created with this otherwise have no special properties. Painting a car will not allow you to ride in it. You could theoretically create most of a working car by painstakingly painting every individual part of it, from the tires to the screws to the chassis to the innards, and putting them together by hand, but this would be quite difficult and a car produced via normal methods would likely be more efficient.


:: Timekeeper's Keepsake Description
A small metallic pocketwatch. Twisting it and halting its movement will stop time in a sphere with a 10-meter radius surrounding the watch, but only for non-organic (i.e. not living or primarily made up of something previously living) object, and not for the watch itself. Can remain active for 5 minutes, and is recharged to full after 24 hours. Objects stopped in time cannot be moved, but you can apply force to them which will affect the after time resumes.

What kind of materials are your clothes made out of? Make sure your clothing and other Relics don't get caught in the frozen time field.


:: Creator's Bolt Description
A shining arrow inlaid with a red gem. It passes directly through living flesh, and can only collide with non-living objects. If passed through a living human while they imagine a form of media - such as a book, a video game, or a movie - it will emerge from them with a copy of that form of media hanging off of it, tailored to their tastes and specifications, following the genre they would like, the game mechanics they would like if it's a video game, and so oon. The scope of the media will be such that it would take them about 1 hour to enjoy, though they can increase the length by another hour via holding the produced media and passing the arrow through them once more, as many times as they'd like. The media produced won't be a perfect paragon of that particular kind of media or anything, but it absolutely will be enjoyable by the target and anyone with similar tastes. After passing through somebody, the arrow requires 6 hours to recharge before it can produce again.


:: Perpetual Repose Description
A small buckler shield that is completely, utterly indestructible. Drop a meteor on it, detonate a nuke next to it, toss it into a black hole; it won't show so much as a scratch. It'll stick around until the very end of everything.

Naturally, altering the shape of the Relic itself isn't possible for the Relic Workshop in Outset Town. You could have them paint it or attach other things to it though.


:: Toral Wave Description
A silvery loop made of an unknown metal that you should probably avoid touching with your bare hands. It outputs constant, endless electricity as a direct current into anything that touches it, with the precise output varying depending on where on the loop it is touched - varying between 0.3 and 3000 joules per second. This is roughly the range between 'annoying and painful shock that could be harmful if you don't let go' and 'almost definitely fatal electricity for a human; easily enough to power one average 21st century household.' It's probably not enough electricity to fell something as large and a durable as, say, a Drifting Swallower, though it could very well slow one down. There's electricians in the Relic Workshop that can help you customize it, such as by converting it to AC, adding resistors if you need a lower output, or adding battery charging stations.

(Note: 1 joule per second = 1 watt)


:: Flamel's Folly Description
A long, sturdy rod. Upon touching a substance with upwards of 55% purity, it can instantly transmute one element in that substance into an element of that atomic number plus or minus one on the periodic table. Can effect a maximum volume of 1 cubic meter per use, and requires 30 minutes to recharge afterwards.

If the primary substance is a molecular compound, like water, the the element you choose will be transmuted within each individual molecule, for example turning water into fluoronium. Many substances will likely undergo further interesting - and possibly violent - reactions after transmutation.

A large pink rucksack with the ability to connect to an infinite pocket dimension, allowing an infinite number of items to be stored in it weightlessly. Its opening can magically expand to a circle with a diameter of 1 m (3ft), and you can squeeze in anything that can be pushed through the opening - however, living creatures cannot be placed into the pocket dimension. Objects can be removed by simply reaching into the bag while thinking of what you want to retrieve.

In order to actually establish a connection to the pocket dimension, though, you need to take Pocket Hoard on a walk through the One-sided Tunnel, a Wonder in the fifth layer. Until you do, it's just a normal bag with no notable qualities.

A dark-as-obsidian sword that can be enshrouded in flames at its holder's will. The flames produced by this sword never harm the wielder even if they start spreading via a different medium. The sword is also much sharper than any mundane sword, able to slice through iron like bread and even through steel with a bit of elbow grease. In addition to being a powerful weapon, the flame is bright enough to serve as an infinite source of light.

A cybernetic eye, which can cleanly install itself in an empty eye socket. We can offer you a free surgery with general anesthesia back in Outset Town and I would really strongly recommend avoiding any DIY enucleations down here if you can help it...this Relic won't have any trouble adapting if you do, but our professional can get you a much cleaner cut and avoid al of the pain, having you back in adventuring condition in under a day.

When installed, it allows you to see through any material, adjusting your viewing depth and the kind of materials you'd like to see through as you please. It also has much greater visual acuity than a human eye, and can see perfectly in the dark, replacing light sources in most circumstances - but not, for example, the lock you had to activate to retrieve this Relic.

An ocarina that allows anyone playing a song on it to infuse powerful emotions into their music, strongly compelling those who hear it to feel the emotion that the player desires. With repeated, deliberate usage, it can induce effects like addiction or positive emotional conditioning with nice emotions, or irrational fear, phobias, and compulsions with negative emotions.

A headband that substantially increases your ability to focus when worn, preventing procrastination and laziness, increasing creativity, and overall making you much more productive. If you don't hav ethe Sleep Tight Curse, this also allows you to function indefinitely without needing any sleep whatsoever. This does not speed up travel times in the Abyss though, due to the physical limits of the human body still causing you to need some physical rest, even if you don't need to sleep.

An intricately-sculpted iron water pot. If an object with a total volume of less than 5 meters cubed is sprinkled with water from it, that object will become very pliable and stretchy for the next 2 hours, almost like elastic or rubber, and will also rebound with great force upon colliding with other objects, as well as casing other objects to rebound against it in turn. If you were to sprinkle yourself, you could then, for example, whip your arms out to cause them to stretch much further than they can reach normally, before rubberbanding back to their normal length. Rubberized arms can still be damaged if they're through into danger, so take care!

Doesn't come with any water inside. Can double as a water storage device in lieu of a flask, having the capacity for 2 days' worth of water. Sprinkling Miasma-contaminated water from the Abyss onto your skin won't cause any corrupting transformative effects; drinking it will.

A collection of three small tags with a variety of intricate designs etched into them. They're lightly sticky on one side, and can be stuck to and removed from objects continuously without ever losing their stickiness. If a condition (for example, 'an enemy is watching me' or 'I have died') is written on a tag and it is pasted onto a Relic, it can activate that Relic's effect (for example, Sunbeam's flame or the time stop of timekeeper's Keepsake) automatically when those conditions are met. For Relics with passive effects, like Zelus Band, it can instead suppress their effects until the listed conditions are met, so long as you own the Relic.

The tags are not omniscient; they have access to all information their writer would be able to discern from within a 50m (160ft) radius of the tag. Having a computer with internet access in the radius, for example, would allow pasted Relics to potentially react to information available via the internet. Relics activated by this one are still subject to all their original limitations.

A pair of very light and thin woven cloths, one red and one blue. Rubbing an object with the red cloth causes it to be strongly attracted to objects which have been rubbed with the blue cloth, and vice versa, in a manner strongly reminiscent of powerful magnets. Two objects rubbed with the same color of cloth will instead strongly repel each other. Continuous rubbing produces stronger attracting and repelling forces, though with diminishing returns. Rubbing an already-rubbed object with the other cloth will reset the effect.

A spear tipped with a very sharp crystal. If one object (including living creatures) touches the dull end of the weapon and another touches the pointed end, and both objects have individual volumes less than 5 meters cubed, then the two objects will instantly teleport and swap places, regardless of the distance between them and how much time has elapsed since the first end was touched. If a second object touches the same end before one touches the other end, then the new object overwrites the old one. Touching the middle of the spear has no effect. After teleporting, the saved objects are cleared, so it's a one-way teleport.

These qualities can make it difficult and dangerous to use as a conventional weapon, but it can be useful if employed creatively.

A pair of durable metal yo-yos. the string on each can be extended to a maximum of 10 meters (30ft), though the strong contained within sees infinite - if cut at any point, one needs only retrieve more string from the discs. While touching the string, the user can choose to see, heat, feel, taste, or smell from the discs just as well as if they were standing at their location, allowing them to scry around corners and the like. For more distance scrying, you may also leave one of the yo-yos somewhere and touch the other to sense through the second yo-yo regardless of distance. (Do note that the reverse is possible as well.)

The string and discs also serve as near-perfect conductors of electricity and render the user immune to electricity while held.

A cap that, when worn, causes time to seemingly cease to pass when doing purely fun things without any kind of direct benefit, like reading, playing video games, having sec, or watching TV. Time won't actually be stopped, but clocks and calendars won't advance, it won't get brighter or darker outside, major events won't occurs, and you won't grow hungrier, thirstier, or older, need to sleep, or need to use the restroom. Essentially allows you to put all other responsibilities on hold while you have fun. Attempting to exploit this for any kind of productive effort would immediately end the effect.


:: Vain Sculpt Description
@@.alert1; Protected with a pit trap!@@
A 3kg lump of pitch-black clay. It has powerful antimemetic properties - it can only be remembered when it is consciously and directly observed, and when not being observed, it is immediately forgotten. Typically this means that you must look at it to remember it, but touching it and focusing on it, listening to a continuous noise produced by an instrument made from it, or even having your tongue on it and tasting it would also allow you to remain conscious of it. The effect also works though any record or media featuring the Relic. If it is observed once more, lost memories will be restored, but they will be more and more vague the longer the span of time between observations is. Otherwise it has physical properties identical to normal clay, and can be fired to produce stylish black porcelain-like ceramics in your preferred shape. Diluting it by mixing it with normal clay would remove the effects entirely. Ingesting a small quantity of the clay would render you permanently immune to its effects.

Unless you're confident in your sculpting and firing abilities, you may want to leave this one to Outset Town's Relic Workshop.


:: Ring of the Devourer Description
Not currently functional.

An ornate ring. When worn on the finger, the user can permanently absorb any Relics they own into themselves with a touch, destroying it, causing it to instantly vanish, and gaining its qualities and powers. For example, absorbing the Hive Tassel would cause the user to smell and taste strongly of honey (though they probably shouldn't allow themselves to get eaten.) However, they would also vibrate when near bees, and so the effect would probably become more desirable as the years go by.

Activated Relics like Aeonglass can be activated at will (often with an action similar to one that would activate the Relic, like an absorbed Superpositional Skewer requiring you to touch 2 object to get them to swap); passive Relics like Out of Mind will be active permanently. Relics with a recharge like Timekeeper's Keepsake retain their normal required recharge time, and Relics with limited uses like Gleam Dazer retain their limited uses. Absorbed powers come with all the idiosyncrasies and limitations of the original Relic - for example, absorbing Gilden Cage would allow you to cease aging while remaining almost perfectly still, with even the small eye movement involved in reading a book pausing the effect. This demonstrates that the absorbed effect won't always be superior to the non-absorbed Relic in every situation.

It cannot destroy the Eternal Repose Relic, and so cannot absorb it.

You can absorb the Ring of the Devourer itself. This would cause you to involuntarily absorb any other owned Relics that you touch, and so isn't recommended.


:: Pulse Bloom Description
A single, deep crimson flower that seems exceptionally durable and much hardier than any normal flower, capable of easily weathering any kind of neglect you give to it. It also absorbs water through its roots exceptionally quickly, emptying a vase in seconds. If 'watered' with the blood of a living being (though only actual red blood works, blue hemolymph, for example, would have no effect) and then immediately brought to the nose to breathe in deeply, the user would transform into a perfect replica of the blood's source for a period of time proportional to the amount of blood supplied to the flower - maxing out at a total of 2 days for 2 liters of blood (theoretically survivable blood loss for a human, but requiring immediate medical attention.)

If the source of blood dies while you're transformed, the transformation is immediately cancelled. Includes a perfectly recreated appearance, but none of the target's memories or skills. Cutting this Relic with the Giddy Reaper Relic would render the split portions useless, forcing you to wait for it to regrow before you can use it again.

Regular, repeated use to hide Curses would slowly result in discomfort and poor health in the long-term, as your body struggles to reclaim its 'proper' Curse-afflicted shape against the Pulse Bloom's power.


:: Out of Mind Description
A small mantle cloak. When worn, the user becomes completely invisible to everyone except themselves. The effect extends to worn clothing and held items, and even works indirectly through photos and recordings. It affects all methods of detection that rely on vision, even things like thermal vision equipment.

The beasts of the Abyss have incredible senses of smell and hearing. You should not expect this alone to allow you to avoid them, though with other measures it may help.

As with Pulse Bloom, using this constantly and regularly in an attempt to hide weird appearance-based Curses is ill-advised. You need to give your body a little room to breathe in its proper Curse-affected form every so often, or it will cause problems.


:: Still Film Description
At first glance, it seems to be a normal instant camera, yet the pictures it develops are almost uncannily high-definition, appearing like small windows into another reality. If such a photo is inserted into a slot in the camera and somebody looks through the lens, they will find themselves mentally transported to a perfect recreation of whatever and whenever the photo was taken, assuming the role the photographer was in. Other subjects of the picture, including humans will appear too, reacting to situations and conversations just as the 'real' subject would. The user will exit the simulated world if they travel 100m (330ft) from where the photographer was, if 1 hour passes, or if they die, returning to the real world with no apparent time having passed. Nothing physical can be taken in or out of the photo, but you can learn information from it. Editing a photo taken by this camera removes its special effect.


:: Forbidden Grimoire Description
A grisly-looking ragged book written in an indecipherable language. Words can only be seen on the page when a person reads it alone, and they vanish as that one person reads them. This will take whatever skills the reader possesses and improve them greatly, leaving a blank, non-useful book behind. Mechanically speaking, if you let a companion use it, it would double the specific numeric benefit of their special ability - Khemia would reduce travel costs by 4 days, Cloud would reduce bullet costs by 4 (minimum 1), Cherry would reduce status effect lengths by 2, and so on. (It doesn't really affect, say, Khemia's ability to slay monsters so much - he's already trained to nearly the maximum human limits, and if there's a monster he can't defeat, it's more about the monster simply being durable beyond the human body's limits than it is about any imperfections in his fighting sills.) Using it on yourself could help you in your normal life, but probably not very much on your journey - the benefit would be substantially less than that from using it on a companion, anyways. If one person were to read it twice (such as through Kin Shifter), the second use would have no benefit - best to spread it out among multiple companions.


:: Luminous Phantasmagoria Description
A small halo that can magically uphold itself a few centimeters above the head of anyone it's placed on. While it is worn like this, it magically prevents the wearer from being officially reprimanded due to the effects of any of their Curses - people will still notice if you have odd ears, or if you're way hornier than normal, or if you're walking around in a public space naked, and you may very well become a spectacle due to any of these things, but you won't actually get in trouble for any of them. You won't be thrown out of store, or thrown into jail, or kidnapped for dissection, or given a fine due to Curses.

Also makes you seem slightly more innocent in general. People still won't forgive you if you're caught stealing or anything, but they'll be less inclined to believe you're capable of doing misdeeds to begin with, and a bit more understanding of minor transgressions.


:: Relativity Eye Description
A magnifying glass. Touching one side of it to a Relic slowly increases the size of that Relic up to 50x its normal size, while touching the other side of it slowly reduces a Relic to approximately 1/50<sup>th</sup> of its normal size. Mass is increased or reduced appropriately. The effects slowly revert over the course of an hour with no contact to the glass. Can provide a a total of 16 hours of altered sizes a day, which may be split up across multiple different Relics. Only works on Relics. Doesn't inherently increase the ranges of Relics like Timekeeper's Keepsake, but it would, for example, provide a bigger cutting surface with Sunbeam or a bigger and longer whip with Yliaster Materia.


:: Return to Sender Description
A marker that never seems to run out of ink. When used to mark something, that thing can be instantly recalled to the hands of whoever holds the marker at any time, so long as it is within 200 meters (660 ft) of the user. A maximum of 11 objects can be marked at once, with the mark from the oldest object disappearing if a 7<sup>th</sup> is marked. Marked things cannot be living for the recall to work. Over the course of 24 hours, the recall may be used to transport objects a maximum combined total distance of 20km (12 miles).


:: Yliaster Materia Description
A whip that allows you to freely alter the phase-changing conditions of any non-living matter it touches - for example, by making water a gas at room temperature, or turning steel into a liquid at room temperature. Both temperature and pressure conditions can be freely changed. This Relic has no effect on the actual temperature or pressure of the matter in question, only the conditions under which it will change state - so turning metal into a liquid won't increase the temperature, and neither will turning water into a plasma. Altered substances will have the physical properties that state would normally have, sans the requisite temperature and pressure. Any matter within a 5m radius of where the whip directly contacts can be affected, amd the same matter can have its phase-changing conditions freely manipulated for up to 10 minutes after contact, even if it's moved.

This has an interesting additional effect when used on other Relics - while Relics are altered to a different state of matter will typically be 'destroyed' and cease functioning as you would expect, upon being returned to their normal state of matter (typically solid), they will immediately return to their normal shape and regain functionality, rather than being reformed as a misshapen useless blob. This allows Relics to be freely state-changed without worry of permanently damaging them.


:: Aeonglass Description
A handheld hourglass containing a shimmering liquid. When turned upside-down and allowed to flow, it causes time in a 5 meter (16ft) radius around the hourglass to move at double speed relative to the outside radius for 10 minutes. Those inside the radius will see events outside it moving at half their typical speed, while those outside will see events inside moving at twice the normal speed, but neither will likely notice anything especially strange on their own side for the duration - sped-up brains inside the radius will process the sped-up events, and they will appear at normal speed.

After it has begun to flow to one side, it can only be turned again for another 5-minute time acceleration once the liquid has completely flowed into the other end. If it is kept completely vertical the entire time, this will take about 3 hours.

:: Aeonglass with Endless Time Description
<<include "Aeonglass Description">>

The Aeonglass has had its temporal limits broken by Endless Time, allowing you to constantly slow down time around you, effectively doubling your travel speed when it's active!

:: Apparatus Diaboli Description
A scroll of nearly-transparent paper emblazoned with a variety of multicolored runes. The paper is quite strong, almost fabric-like. The paper can be unrolled to a maximum length of 3 meters (10ft), and if a section of it is cut away, the scroll will regenerate to its full length over the course of one day so long as the two halves are kept in close proximity with each other.

If a series of terms and conditions are written on part of it, and it is signed by at least 2 parties who know and understand the terms, the terms will become absolute, and if any signing party willingly goes against the terms, they will instantly die. The contract can only be annulled if the terms are met, or the paper that the contract is written on is destroyed.


:: Heavy is the Head Description
A fox-shaped mask. It feels unusually heavy in your hands when you hold it.

Wearing it causes a general increase in problem solving ability, ability to learn and retain new information and ability to recognize patterns, sering as a 'generalized intelligence increase.' Usage is not limited to humans. When it adorns any sentient being, it will at minimum bring them to average human intelligence, if not higher. Doesn't automatically come with the ability to speak any human language, but they can learn if they have vocal cords that can operate around human ranges.

All effects are lost when the mask is removed.


:: Daedalus Mechanism Description
An incredibly complex and intricate mechanism that is wrapped around the chest like a sash, and interfaces electrically with the nervous system. It uses energy from the wearer's body to function as wings, and while it takes a great deal of practice at first, flying with it can be incredibly fun and potentially useful. They also have advanced cloaking technology that can allow them to look and feel like just about any kind of wings you could imagine, from bird wings to demon wings to dragon wings. The sash around your chest can be made undetectable, too.

Mechanically speaking, it can <i>halve</i> the time costs requires to ascend between layers (rounded up), for layers between here and the surface(But not any deeper.) It also allows you to avoid the Hexflame Fields of layer 6. Finally, any movement penalty that you got from losing limbs is negated when the Daedalus Mechanism is equipped. This comes with a few important caveats: first, if you're going to be making use of these bonuses, you should take your normal comfortable carrying weight and <i>halve</i> it. Flying is strenuous work, and carrying heavy loads is just completely unsustainable. Second, unless you copy extra pairs for all of your companions, they won't be able to join you when you make use of these bonuses. They'll be left behind making a slower trek up through the layers or getting jinxed flames that slow he down, and if you leave them alone to deal with that, it would be very bad for team morale. They could potentially choose to stop traveling with you for it, if you do it without a good reason.


:: Blind Divine Description
A blindfold with several mysterious symbols etched into it. When on, it makes the wearer <i>completely</i> aware of everything within a 15 meter (50ft) radius from themselves - they can freely sense any physical phenomena and matter within the radius. In a sense, it works as a kind of limited-distance omniscience - though this Relic only tells you what happens within the radius, and doesn't draw conclusions about events for you. You can even 'zoom in' on areas to sense individual atoms or go even deeper with great focus, though it will never be possible to use this to extrapolate significant information about what goes on outside of the radius. No macroscopic events within the radius will even escape your notice, however.

The blindfold must completely cover our eyes in order to work, and so you will likely be unable to see outside the radius. You may need to remove the blindfold frequently so you aren't surprised by distant events.


:: Lambent Specter Description
A paper lantern that cannot be lit via normal means. If held while imagining a human who has died, that person can be reintroduced to this plane of existence as a flickering flame in the lantern. They can speak to those around them in a whispery, hushed voice, and can see and hear just as well as a human can. If the lantern is surrounded by a vaguely human-shaped body, they can control it as if it were their own, allowing you to create a golem. If the lantern's flame is doused, or the lantern is held while imagining a different dead person, the soul currently inhabiting the lantern will vanish, and cannot be returned to this plane again. The flame can only be doused with water, and will otherwise keep burning indefinitely. Otherwise the soul cannot leave voluntarily and is not compelled to obey orders. They won't be able to share any information about any afterlives or the like.

Golems created with this function very similarly in the Abyss to those with the 'purity gene', and so cannot scout downwards alone or be used to avoid corruption costs for Relics.


:: Phoenix Obol Description
A large coin. When kept on one's person, it grants the user a one-time revival from essentially any kind of lethal force. If they die, they will revive two hours later in the same spot, with whatever damage that did them in (whether wounds, poison, disease, or otherwise) gone, the obol having vanished. Doesn't have any effect on age-related deaths. It still woks with the Creature of the Night Curse, despite the user debatably not really being 'alive.'

If the user is killed by the Spectre of the End, it will retreat a small distance before advancing again, reaching you once more in 50 days. Dying to a different source leaves the counter unaffected. Whatever serum the shop uses for loans is unaffected by this Relic, and if you die to it, then you'll just die right away again after you're revived.


:: Granted Granite Description
A small dropper containing exactly 5 drops of a pale green liquid. If a drop is squeezed onto a Relic, that Relic will become completely unbreakable, unable to be scratched by any force whatsoever - essentially gaining the power of the Perpetual Repose Relic. The drop is consumed in the process. Only works on Relics.

Strengthened Phoenix Obols would still vanish after use. It travels to another plane beyond your reach and becomes useless to you, but it isn't destroyed.


:: Joyous Sunder Description
When moving the blade of this knife towards any physical matter, it will slice clean through, with no resistance whatsoever. The only physical objects that it cannot successfully cleave are the the Perpetual Repose Relic or any Relics strengthened by Granted Granite. Anything else, from steel to dragon hide to robots, will be sliced effortlessly. Even saying it 'cuts through them like butter' would be overstating the required effort.

Being a small knife, it is still quite difficult and dangerous to use as a weapon in many situations, compared to say, a sword or a gun. Khemia would be much less effective with it than a regular sword, for example, and his regular swordplay would probably be more effective than just about anyone's Joyous Sunder knifeplay, outside of special circumstances.

Be careful you don't drop it. If it falls the wrong way, it'll slice through the ground and may be lost forever.


:: Azure Aozora Description
A collection of minor arcana tarot cards, each depicting art with a weather motif. There are eight different weather patterns depicted in all: rain, thunderstorm, snow, hail, clear and sunny, cloud, foggy, and a very windy day. Each weather pattern is depicted on seven different cards in the pack, for 56 cards total. If one of the cards is burned, it will ensure that weather will dominate the next day, for a radius of roughly 50 km (30 miles) from the burning. Burning new cards will overwrite the old ones. The whole pack of cards will be magically refreshed at the start of every month. Naturally, this Relic has little impact down in the Abyss, where surface weather can only barely reach past the first layer, and never past the second.


:: Glare Vantage Description
An oddly-shaped stone lamp, the glimmering light of which can be seen even through the thickest of materials. While touching it, the user can freely control all light levels within a 100m (330ft) radius, making any individual area within the radius as dark or as light as they wish. Functions as a light source, but not an effective heat source.


:: Final Stage Description
A large bed that you'll probably need to disassemble into parts to carry to the surface. If somebody falls asleep on it, every creature physically capable of sleep in a 25km (15 miles) radius will fall into a roughly 3 hour sleep that they cannot be roused from. Everyone who falls asleep from this will enter a shared lucid dream, each with a degree of control over the dream, though the one who used the bed will have roughly 10x the normal influence over it. The dream has no other special qualities. The person who used the bed can optionally be roused after only 1 1/2 hours of the effect being active, if an outside force wakes them up.


:: Solace Lace Description
A small white bow. When worn, it magically protects the wearer from environmental temperature: anywhere from the peak of a volcano to the north pole to deep space could be traversed with no protective gear, without worrying about the temperatures (though deep space still comes with, like, a billion other dangers.) This could be very helpful in some layers of the Abyss! Doesn't protect from non-environmental heat, so don't go jumping into magma. Also protects the wearer from all forms of sickness and disease, except aging.


:: Red Thread Flourish Description
A large red ribbon that will gently wrap around a part of your body, like your wrists legs, or torso. While attached to you it can move around according to your thoughts, and is capable of picking up objects (though not with quite as much strength as your arms), attacking others like a whip, hardening slightly to slice through some soft materials, and performing surprisingly intricate and delicate work, with a maximum range of approximately 20 meters. They will also attempt to quickly protect you from any incoming attacks whether you're conscious of them or not, though they aren't fast enough to stop bullets or similar projectiles. If they're damaged but at least 10% of them remains, they'll slowly regenerate to their full length from the largest strand, with the smaller strands evaporating in the process.


:: Triage Rain Description
A bubble wand that can blow huge bubbles in quick succession indefinitely, without appearing to use any soap. The bubbles will pop whenever they hit a split object and clean up a large area around the, cleaning many different kinds of filth, including pollution, junk, and household messes. It even cures bacterial and viral diseases! If bubbles are blown continuously upwards for a minute, they will instead create a very light, immaterial cleaning rain that can efficiently clean up a 500km (310 miles) radius in minutes, without getting anything wet.

The water created from this vanishes upon contact with any solid surface, and so cannot be used for normal water purposes, like quenching thirst or extinguishing fires. Has no effect on Miasma. Guess that doesn't qualify as 'pollution.'

:: Voila Viola Description

A large, intricate string instrument. When played it allows the user to freely control any liquids within the range that the sound would be audible to humans. Under normal conditions, this will be about 100 meters (330ft.) Up to 10 cubic meters of liquid can be controlled at once.

It cannot control liquids that are currently part of a living organism, like circulating blood.

:: Between Whispers Description

A collection of 12 fancy ear piercings in a variety of different styles. Wearing one of these will allow one to read the surface thoughts of those in a 10 meter (30 feet) radius around you, as well as transmit your thoughts to them, allowing telepathic communication as well as spying on the private thoughts of others. Wearing two earrings will allow you to double the radius, but wearing more beyond that will not increase it further. Those wearing the earrings can telepathically communicate with each other regardless of distance.

:: Absolute Oracle Description

A medallion to be worn around the neck. Once a day, you may speak any yes/no question into it and receive an accurate answer from a mysterious, whispering voice.

:: Memory Reign Description

A thin, delicate conductor's baton. By tapping someone on the head with it, you can freely edit any of their memories, including erasing them outright. you can also remove their memories and store them in the baton, and even transfer these memories to someone else if you so desire. If you were to use it on yourself, you could do things like experience your favorite show or book with all the same suspense and surprise that you did the first time.

:: Drifting Aperture Description

While wearing these shoes, you can turn your entire body intangible to everything except the shoes, allowing you to move through walls as though they were jello and have attacks pass through you. The shoes share your intangibility, too. However, the intangibility will not apply in any way that causes you to sink downwards into the ground (or any material that you wouldn't already be sinking into.)

Note that clothing and carried items don't become intangible with you , and beasts of the Abyss may go after them instead if you cease to be a valid target. Patient and smart beasts may stalk you and wait for you to become tangible again before attacking. Using this to avoid attacks could very well mean losing all your other stuff and your companions in exchange, if you're not careful about it.

:: Aegis Coffin Description

If you were to fall asleep in this coffin, your entire skeleton would be replaced overnight with orichalcum, a bluish metallic replacement approximately 20x more durable than the strongest of steels, yet no heavier than bone, with many areas reinforced to eave no clear gaps to reach vital organs. It remains just as flexible and useful as your old skeleton, while offering much greater protection from any forms of physical trauma. It performs the normal non-structural functions of a skeleton, such as blood cell production, too, and can grow with you as you age if necessary. The hardness of the skeleton can be temporarily moved around your body, with roughly 5% of it hardened at a given time - allowing you to harden your fists for powerful punches, for example.

You'll find your old skeleton lying neatly next to you in the coffin when you wake up. You can keep it as a souvenir, if you like.

:: Gaia Theory Description

At first appears to be a normal snow globe with a miniature model of a human inside, but via a series of knobs and switches on the bottom, the environment inside can be changed to a variety of different biomes (classified by common word usage rather than any rigorous scientific definition), including settings for polar, grassland, jungle, forest, desert, savanna, mountain, and ocean biomes at the time you receive it. More specific or exotic settings can be stored in it by taking it to a biome you'd like to copy and shaking it. When the largest button on the bottom of it is pressed, it will slowly terraform the area in a radius of 200km (120 miles) around this Relic. It would take roughly 6 months to fully terraform the area in its radius, but areas closer to the center will be finished significantly faster. Drastic changes, like forming an ocean in the middle of a landmass, may be significantly slower. Has no effect on the environment of the Abyss, though you can copy aspects of these layers for use elsewhere. Works perfectly even on barren planets.

The sprite living inside can't be removed, but she's happy in there. She frolics about the globe's environments when she thinks nobody's watching.

:: Glory's Grasp Description

A mechanical prosthetic that can automatically install itself into any empty arm or leg socket, adjusting its shape accordingly. As before, I'd recommend using Outset Town's free surgery on the surface as opposed to DIY amputation, though it's your call. Alternatively, you could also install it after receiving the Ampu-Q-tie Curse from this layer, though this would still be a much less pleasant experience than surgery in town, and might heal with some scars.

Small movements of the joints allow you to fully control the direction and strength of gravity in up to a 25 meter (80ft) radius around the limb, or in a smaller more precise radius with softer movements. You can increase gravity to a maximum strength of ten times Earth's gravity, which would be enough to render any human immobile and probably cause a fair deal of harm in its own right. The limb itself, when installed, is also immune to the effects of gravity, which would be enough to render any human immobile and probably cause a fair deal of harm in its own right. The limb itself, when installed, is also immune to the effects of gravity, even unaltered gravity, and thus feels weightless. This effect doesn't extend to the rest of your body, but having two of them as legs, for example, would allow you to move more easily than others under strong gravity.

This doesn't allow for as precise control in the air as the Daedalus Mechanism Relic, and this combined with the limb's immunity to its own gravity makes this an inefficient and potentially dangerous choice for "flying", at least without special considerations.

:: Pneuma Wisp Description

A sash to be wrapped around the torso. When worn, it completely removes the wearer's need for oxygen - their body will perform all of its normal functions with or without oxygen input. It also deals with carbon dioxide waste that you would normally need to exhale, so you can hold your breath as long as you like while experiencing no discomfort.

Aside from allowing you to function in environments without usable oxygen, having this will naturally reduce the dangers of significant blood loss. You still need blood to get nutrients around you body, remove waste, and perform various other functions, and if vital organs are pierced then it's an entirely different story, but with this Relic, the most immediate danger of severe hemorrhaging - passing out and experiencing brain death due to lack of oxygen - is averted.

The effect will be lost if the sash is torn apart.

:: World's End Lock Description

A star-shaped key. Any door with a lock that this key has touched can connect to any other such door so long as the knob is turned by someone holding the key, allowing near-instant teleportation with no distance limit. However, mysterious interference from Miasma prevents it from being used to connect doors between different layers of the Abyss or the surface, so ou can't use it to quickly travel back to layer 7 or the surface. You can use it for intra-layer travel though, subtracting one day from all travel times in this layer and layer 7, due to the abundance of doors that you can teleport between.

:: Fray Goo Description

A distant "relative" of the Kin Shifter Relic, perhaps? The face, again, appears, decorative. 

Give the bottle a good shake while thinking of some Relics you own, uncork it, and pour it out, and this Relic will quickly spread to them and duplicate them. Unlike Kin Shifter, Fray Goo has no limits as to how many Relics it can copy after activated, and you could theoretically bury yourself in a pile of the strongest Relics around, if you so desired. It can create copies of a Relic it touches at a maximum rate of about 3 Relics per second. However, Fray Goo will only remain active for 1 minute, after which it will automatically retreat back to its bottle and sleep, and all the extra copies it transformed into will also be lost, Forbidden Grimoire Effects will be lot, Phoenix Obol revivals will be undone, Granted Granite-strengthened Relics will be unstrengthened, and so on. Knowledge gleamed from Gleam Dazer remains. After going to sleep, it will remain dormant for 9 days, and is completely impossible to wake up and use during that time. 

:: Null Void Description

A small gemstone that completely removes all of the special, supernatural effects granted by other Relics in a 10cm (4in) radius around it, leaving them as normal, mundane objects until they leave the radius. Shaking it will gradually increase the radius to a maximum of 10m (32ft) before eventually looping back down to 10cm, with a slight color distortion being visible while shaking to help the user visualize the range. Remains fully functional when broken so long as at least 5% of the original gem mass remains in a given piece. If a single piece is held against a particular Relic for 1 minute, it will be attuned to it and only nullify that Relic's effects, and no others - this can be cancelled by dipping the attuned piece into liquid mercury. Aspects of the world that thy have affected are not themselves supernatural, such as environments created by Gaia Theory, are not affected - this Relic would merely prevent further terraforming. Could be useful for particularly complex Relic combinations and strategies, but offers little benefit on its own.

The one supernatural effect not cancelled is the unbreakability of Eternal Repose and Relics affected by Granted Granite. Their absolute unbreakability doesn't come with an asterisk.
