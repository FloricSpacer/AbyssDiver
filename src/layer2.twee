!Layer 2 - Dewdrop Rain Underbrush
@@
\
As you enter the second layer, the clear open fields of the first gradually give way to a convoluted mass of trees, vines, and thorns, a thicket more dense than any you've ever seen. You proceed further down, the inscrutable tangle of plant matter growing taller and taller above you, eventually completely shielding the first layer from view. You feel a light pinprick on your nose and look up, thinking it to be rain, but no - these drops are falling from the plants above you, tiny dewdrops coalescing on the vines, falling down as a light drizzle at first, gathering yet more water as they fall through the enormous jungle, and finally reaching the roots of some of the tallest trees as a veritable monsoon.

This layer is filled with a very dense growth of vines, bushes, and other plant life that impedes you and makes movement very time-consuming. Having a way to clear them out of your way would make navigation much easier. Subtract 1 day from every time on this layer (including the cost of going up or down layers) if you have a sword with you to cut through the flora.

	Above you, a blood-curdling screech fills the air. Freezing in fear, a bird seems to fly from the canopy above you, paying no mind to you on the ground. Strangely, it looks almost like a hawk, but as if its mouth were turned sideways and it's wings were a bit too sharp-edged to match any bird you've seen before. However, you don't get a chance to get a good look at it before it flaps it's wings and and leaves you once again with only the sound of the dripping rain. <br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 2>>
	At one point along your path, you spot a tangle of vines that seem to rustle slightly, but upon further inspection there is nothing inside them. After spending a minute watching them, you realize the sound comes from the speed at which the vines are growing, which seems to be a few centimeters a minute. You also hear a crunch, which seems to originate from the long-dead skeleton of a small mammal being crushed by the vines. Wisely, you decide to move on and conclude this would not be a good place to make camp. <br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 3 && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.id === setup.companionIds.saeko) && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.id === setup.companionIds.lily)>>
	You hear a loud hissing sound in one of the bushes nearby, and suddenly Saeko stops your group from moving forward.
	<br><br>
	<<say $companionSaeko>>Wait, we have to go around here. I'm not sure what would make a sound like that here, but I suspect it's not a good idea to find out.<</say>><br>
	Lily almost walks forward on her own.
	<br><br>
	<<say $companionLily>>I don't know either! I really want to find out though! It can't be that bad if it's only on the second layer, right?<</say>><br>
	Saeko grabs her collar and sighs.
	<br><br>
	<<say $companionSaeko>>I believe I heard of a certain diver who thought similarly, but he was lost a few years ago. Better not to fall prey to some unknown venomous creature here.<</say>><br>
	Lily hesitates, but eventually agrees and your group ends up going around the potential threat.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 4 && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.id === setup.companionIds.cherry)>>
	A diminutive, feline-like creature pads toward you, emitting a soft, plaintive mew. You pause, uncertain, but Cherry quickly crouches, gently stroking behind its tufted ear. Her features are etched with a distant, melancholic expression, and she exhales a wistful sigh as the creature purrs softly, almost inaudibly.
	
	<<say $companionCherry>>I remember this being fun. Why does it feel so empty now?<</say>><br>
	Rising, she steps aside, offering you a chance to interact with the feline, and it feels much softer than you'd expect, as if it were a sack of blubber rather than a cat. But after a few minutes, it gets tired of your touches and tightens up as it scampers away. Cherry is staring at the sky, letting the rain run down her face with no resistance. <<if $hiredCompanions.some(c => c.id === setup.companionIds.maru)>>Maru walks over to her and gives her a big, warm hug, but despite reaching her arms around him, her expression never changes.<</if>><br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp === 5>>
	You stumble upon a tranquil, crystal-clear pond, with bioluminescent plants casting a soft, otherworldly glow upon its surface. The gentle hum of insects creates a soothing melody, accompanied by the occasional splash of leaping fish as they break the water's surface. As you draw closer, you notice that the fish are adorned with vivid, iridescent scales, shimmering like living gemstones under the luminescent light. You are momentarily entranced by this serene oasis, a welcome reprieve from the dangers you've faced thus far. However, you remind yourself to remain vigilant and continue on your journey, with the memory of the pond's enchanting beauty etched in your mind. <br><br>

	The dew continually drips down around you, creating the illusion of a rainstorm without clouds. The atmosphere is heavy, partially with humidity, but mainly with the ever-present, creeping corruption of the miasma.

:: Layer2 Forage Convo

<<if $mudHunt === 1>>You and Maru wander through the dripping rainforest of the second layer, on the hunt for Mudgrazers. Maru had mentioned that their meat would make a delicious dish, so you accompanied him on this quest. <<if $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.id === setup.companionIds.khemia)>>Khemia tags along, ensuring your safety from any lurking threats in the forest.<</if>>

Maru crouches through some ferns and, gesturing at large indentations in the mud, you follow.

<<say $companionMaru>>They should be just over here, but we need to be quiet so no Baying Gourmet comes and steals the meat when we kill it.<</say>>
<<if $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.id === setup.companionIds.cloud)>><<say $companionCloud>>I can take the shot. I'm experienced enough to kill it efficiently. Unless you would prefer to do it, Maru?<</say>>
Maru shakes his head vigorously.

<<say $companionMaru>>No thank you! I'm not a fan of the hunt and I probably couldn't hit it anyway!<</say>>
Cloud nods and expertly lines up the shot, pulling the trigger with precision. The Mudgrazer dies instantly, its body collapsing to the ground. Cloud offers a faint smile, reflecting pride in his skills, yet somehow tinged with solemnity.
<<else>><<say $mc>>Do you want to take the shot? Or should I do it?<</say>>
Maru shakes his head vigorously.

<<say $companionMaru>>No thank you! I'm not a fan of the hunt and I probably couldn't hit it anyway!<</say>>
You nod, line up the shot, and pull the trigger. The lumbering beast falls after a brief struggle.
<</if>>
The other Mudgrazers in the herd dash away with surprising speed, demonstrating the wisdom of hunting them with a gun.

<<say $mc>>So, Maru, you know how to butcher this thing?<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>>I think so. It won't be perfect, but it should still be tasty!<</say>>
Together, you haul the carcass back to camp for a feast. Upon returning, Maru hesitates but then confidently slices the meat into manageable chunks. He selects choice cuts to cook over the fire, while placing tougher pieces in a bowl near the edge of the camp.

Once the Mudgrazer steak is cooked, Maru hands you a piece, eagerly awaiting your reaction. As you take your first bite, the flavor is intense – a concentrated fusion of beef, pork, and chicken that is both unique and familiar. Maru grins at your response and digs into his own meal.

A growl interrupts your feast. A Baying Gourmet has appeared! You tense up, ready for a fight, but Maru stops you.

<<say $companionMaru>>Wait! I left some food over there for him. They leave us alone if we give them food, so for tonight it should be ok. He'll leave when he's full so we're safe for tonight at least.<</say>>
You notice the Gourmet contentedly munching on the meat Maru left in the bowl, paying you no mind. Relieved, you return to savoring the meal Maru prepared. As you and your companions finish eating, the Baying Gourmet ambles away, satisfied with its meal.

<<else>>You and Maru stroll through the dripping rainforest of the second layer, searching for Flanberries. Maru had raved about their delicious taste, so you decided to seek them out together.

<<say $mc>>So if these berries are so delicious, why don't people eat them on the surface?<</say>>
Maru frowns, pausing before answering.

<<say $companionMaru>>There's a few reasons. The main one is that food from the Abyss rots super fast when you remove it from its native layer, so it wouldn't survive longer than a day on the surface. People don't usually get a chance to bring it up even if they try to. Also, if you pick the unripe ones, they can have side effects... And not many people know the difference.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>So how do you tell the difference between the ripe and unripe ones?<</say>>
Maru giggles and smiles at you.

<<say $companionMaru>>Well, I don't, but the side effects aren't too bad, so it's worth the risk.<</say>>
Maru leads you to a managed glade, where the Flanberries are guarded by people who appear to own the land. After a brief conversation with the guards, Maru returns to you.

<<say $companionMaru>>The berries here are owned by some big guy in the nearby village, but he said it's okay if we take just enough for us since we're divers and we won't be here too long anyway. And he said that maybe you could even move here and enjoy his generosity as a permanent resident. I told him not to have any expectations about that though.<</say>>
Maru starts picking shiny, red berries, occasionally plucking unripe, unsafe ones.<<if $abyssKnow === 1>>Luckily, your knowledge allows you to remove them from the bundle before anyone eats them. Who knows what would have happened if you weren't here.<</if>>

After collecting enough berries, you head back to camp with Maru. He mashes the berries into a paste, adding a few herbs he gathered along the way. The result is a delicious, nutty, red pudding with whole berries mixed in for texture. You and your companions share the scrumptious dessert, delighting in its unique flavor as you relax in the camp.

You press forward through the second layer as your search from the Empty-handed Broker, and as you do, the dewdrops from above accumulate, each one adding to the torrent of droplets cascading down from the treetops. The once gentle drizzle intensifies into a monsoon, pounding against the soil and leaves, filling the air with the deafening roar of water.

<<if $visitL3 !== 0 || $brokerUsed>>\
Through the deluge, you catch a glimpse of a small worn down shrine. As you approach, you find a pile of rubble in its center, where once was a statue. There is nothing more for you to do here.
<<else>>\
Through the deluge, you catch a glimpse of something unusual nestled in the tangled undergrowth. As you approach, the sinister visage of the Broker reveals itself. The alabaster statue stands before you, an eerie contrast to the vibrant, chaotic jungle surrounding it. The twisted horns and chipped robe give the figure a sense of ancient malevolence, as if the statue is an echo of a time long past.

<<if $corruption < -100>>\
You hesitantly reach out to touch the statue's hands, but as soon as you make contact, your hand slips away. You try again with the same result. The broker is not willing to make a deal with you at this time, as your corruption would still be negative after receiving +100 corruption.
<<else>>\
You hesitantly reach out to touch the statue's hands, and a sudden wave of claustrophobia washes over you. The sensation is suffocating, as if the vines and thorns have closed in around you, leaving you with no escape. The feeling passes as quickly as it came, leaving you with a lingering sense of unease.

As the chilling rain continues to pour down around you, you realize the weight of the choice you have made. You have gained 100 corruption points, but you must always keep your corruptions points above 0 from now until the end of your journey.

Your thoughts are interrupted by the sound of falling rocks. As you look up, you see the Broker statue has collapsed.

You push through the dense foliage, seeking the site of the pond, until the sight of rugged rocks breaks the monotony of green. As you approach, you find a hidden gem: the Fate-crossing Star's pond. The water is a glistening, crystalline blue, its surface disturbed only by the faintest of ripples. The scent of freshness, a welcome contrast to the cloying jungle air, fills your nostrils.

Would you like to swim in the pond of the Fate-crossing Star?

	With cautious curiosity, you step into the water, which embraces your weary limbs like a soothing balm. It's comfortable, despite the foreign environment, but an inexplicable itch manifests in the back of your mind. You can't help but feel that the pond hides a secret, waiting to be uncovered.

	As you immerse yourself, the sounds of the jungle seem to fade, replaced by the gentle lapping of water against the rocks. Time loses meaning as you become one with the pond, allowing its cool embrace to envelop you entirely.

	When morning comes, you find yourself waking to an entirely different reality. The familiar weight of your body is gone, replaced by a foreign, alien sensation. You open your eyes and realize that you have swapped bodies with one of your companions. You look into a puddle on the ground and stare in disbelief at your own face, now looking back at you with equal astonishment.

	The moment the Curse grips you, you feel an intense sensation. Your penis springs to full erection, and then continues to grow. The base, the shaft, and the tip swell larger than they've ever been before, until you're sporting a $mc.penisCor inch long dong.

	As the erection gradually subsides, you find yourself shifting awkwardly, seeking a comfortable position to accommodate your member, which insists on staying at a larger size than you're used to.

[img[setup.ImagePath + "Curses/fluffyears.png"]]

Suddenly, a peculiar sensation prickles the side of your head, an uncomfortable itch that seems to radiate from deep within your skull. You pause, attempting to make sense of the unexpected feeling, your fingers instinctively reaching up to alleviate the sudden irritation. But what you find in the place of your human ears startles you into freezing mid-movement.

There, atop your head, are new appendages — unfamiliar, soft, and covered in fur. The realization floods in with a cold gasp: the Abyss has once again asserted its strange influence over your body.

For a moment, you are paralysed by the thought of how this transformation would alter your existence, but quickly you're overwhelmed by the sensations of the change taking place.

<<nobr>>
<<if $mc.ears === "furry cat">>
Your new ears morph into triangular, sleek structures, covered in short velvety fur that feels tantalizingly soft under your fingertips. Enhanced acuity introduces you to an orchestra of unheard sounds - the rustling of leaves, the skittering of hidden insects, and even the distant murmur of the Abyss, whispers on the wind barely comprehensible.
<<elseif $mc.ears === "fluffy dog">>
Your ears take on a form that can be floppy or erect, a spectrum of sizes and textures - from short-haired, glossy coats to long-haired, fluffy varieties. An overwhelming surge of sounds engulfs you, the echoing call of unseen creatures and the whistling of the wind among the leaves suddenly turn deafening, yet incredibly nuanced.
<<elseif $mc.ears === "furry rabbit">>
Your new ears stretch out, becoming elongated, silky soft features, adding an adorable twist to your countenance. A strange tranquility fills you, brought about by the heightened sensitivity, enabling you to discern the subtlest changes in your environment - from the slow pulsation of the Abyss to the most minute shifts in the world around you.
<<elseif $mc.ears === "floppy cow">>
The transformation is a gentle surge that gradually introduces broad, leathery ears atop your head. They're soft to the touch and swivel independently, capturing sounds with a keen sensitivity. The rustling of leaves, the echoes of the Abyss, every faint whisper of the world around you resonates in a soothing cadence, grounding you further into this primeval world.
<<elseif $mc.ears === "furry monkey">>
You find small, furry ears taking the place of your old ones. They're sensitive, picking up on the slightest rustles and tweets, mapping an intricate soundscape around you. With this newfound auditory acuity, you're privy to the most intimate conversations of the Abyss, if there were anyone nearby to talk.
<<elseif $mc.ears === "pig">>
Your ears are soft, broad at the base and tapering to a point, always alert, picking up the slightest changes in the soundscape. The echoes of the Abyss sound different now, each murmur revealing a multitude of layers. This newfound sensitivity becomes an uncanny guide through the labyrinthine second layer of the Abyss.
<<elseif $mc.ears === "furry fox">>
Your ears become pointed, upright, framed by a tuft of soft fur. The world around you comes alive in ways unseen before - every rustling leaf, the elusive patter of distant creatures, the whispers of the Abyss itself - everything amplified, echoing into your consciousness in waves of auditory richness.
<</if>>
<<if $mc.ears === "furry mouse">>
Your new ears are small, round, and delicately thin. You're flooded with a world of sounds so intense it's almost overwhelming. Every rustle, every creak, every gentle whisper of the Abyss now holds much more nuance than before. You become more alert, more aware, each sound guiding your journey through the dense vegetation.
<<else>>
Your ears are long and mobile, lined with short soft fur. Every swivel, every twitch, tunes into the different frequencies of the Abyss. The previously muted world unfurls into a theatre of sound. The hum of the Abyss, the patter of raindrops on leaves, the far-off calls of hidden creatures - you hear it all.
<</if>>
<</nobr>>

Sensory overload washes over you as your new ears flutter open to the sounds of the Abyss. The immediate discomfort eases into a strange sense of exhilaration. The world around you, once veiled in mystery, begins to unfurl in layers of auditory depth you could never have previously imagined.

A shiver runs down your spine, but it doesn't stop at the bottom. The shiver continues towards an imaginary extension of your spine that moves outward from directly above your butt. You involuntarily squirm at first, due to the unfamiliar sensation, but after a few seconds you're able to accommodate it and accept it as just another physical sensation, like your body was adapting to the new sensory inputs.

When you look behind you to see what happened, you're surprised by the sight of a fluffy tail that seems to respond to your thoughts! It's your own tail, a part of your own body! This may take some time to get used to.

[img[setup.ImagePath + Curses/maximumfluff.png.pic]]

Suddenly, you feel a faint tingling sensation, a light pinprick on your nose. The sensation startles you, pulling you out of your singular focus. You look up, half-expecting rain, but what you see are shimmering droplets of dew waltzing down from the overhead vines. It's a strange spectacle – an indoor monsoon, cascading water, reflecting the scant light in mesmerizing patterns as they make their way to the roots of the colossi around you.

As you resume your journey, the prickling sensation on your nose intensifies. It's like the soft tickle of a feather, yet it slowly spreads across your face. Confusion fills your mind, but before you can ponder it further, the prickling tickle sweeps down your neck and begins spreading across your torso, your arms, your legs.

A sudden transformation takes over you, a slow metamorphosis beneath your clothes. Your skin, once smooth, begins to bristle. Wherever the prickling sensation goes, soft fur sprouts in its wake. You pull back your sleeves, your eyes widening at the sight. Your skin is now adorned with a lush coat of $mc.skinType fur.

The new pelt is a peculiar sight, and as you touch it, you feel a thrill of connection to your $mc.skinType skin, whose fur now forms an intimate part of you. It's soft, it's warm, a comfort in this threatening jungle. The very sensation of your hands brushing against your own body has changed, replaced by the soft rustle and whisper of fur-on-fur contact.

As you move, the pelt sways with you, each movement like a breeze rolling over a field of tall grass. Every brush of your clothes against the fur sends delightful shivers through your body. Each shudder, each tickle is a new sensation, a change you never anticipated.

But the second layer of the Abyss isn't the place to contemplate the aesthetics of your transformation. You're a foreign entity in a living, breathing labyrinth. And now, you wear a foreign coat, your skin hidden beneath a blanket of fur.

An intense surge of arousal envelops you, only to gradually ebb away. Then, a weight nestles in the pit of your stomach, and an inescapable sense of fate grips you. The Abyss won't release you that easily. Once a month, an overpowering carnal craving will seize you, driving you to the brink of surrender.

As the realization dawns, you acknowledge the irresistible force of nature that you will become. The potent hormones coursing through your veins will shatter your self-control and obliterate your rationality. The things you'll crave - to fuck and to be fucked in every way imaginable - will be impossible to resist.

How does it feel to know what awaits you? Your quickened breaths betray your inner turmoil, revealing the truth about your deepest desires.

As you proceed, you notice a peculiar sensation washing over you. At first, it's barely perceptible, but gradually, it intensifies. Your limbs feel lighter, your steps more buoyant. You can't help but feel a growing sense of vulnerability, as if your body has become more susceptible to the substances around you.

As the Curse takes hold, your senses are further heightened. The scent of the damp earth becomes intoxicating, and the colors of the surrounding foliage appear more vivid and alluring. You realize that this Curse, Lightweight, has left you more sensitive to the effects of various substances. The thought is both exhilarating and terrifying.

You'll need to be particularly careful with alcohol, or any other similar substance, in the future.

<<if $mc.osex === "male">>\
Suddenly, an unexpected warmth washes through your abdomen, spreading outward in pulses. It's not painful, but it's not entirely pleasant either. You glance down, your eyes widening as you notice the changes. Your penis is retreating inwards, morphing, transforming. The sensation is bizarre, a strange hollow feeling enveloping you as you watch it disappear, only to be replaced by the soft, sensitive folds of a vagina.

Your hands instinctively move to explore this new part of you, a gasp escaping your lips as you feel the delicate tissues, the warmth, the moistness. It feels strange but not foreign, a part of you, a new and exciting sensation that sends shivers down your spine. The sensitivity is heightened, each brush of your fingers sending waves of unexpected pleasure through you.

Simultaneously, a pressure builds in your chest. Looking down, you see your flat pecs swelling, stretching, and forming into round $mc.breastsLabel breasts. The size is proportionate to your previous endowment, each pulse of the Curse adding more to their fullness. Your fingers trace the curves, the sensation of the soft flesh and the erect nipples sending another jolt through your body. You're simultaneously awed and terrified by the sudden transformation.

As you stand in the dense undergrowth of the Abyss, vulnerable and transformed, you can't help but ponder on how these changes will affect your future. How will the others react? Will you be able to adjust to this new body, these new sensations?

Though your physical self has changed, you remain determined. You are still you - just in a new form.
<<else>>\
Suddenly, a peculiar heat radiates from your lower body, alarming yet not painful. Your breath catches as you witness your breasts start to recede, leaving behind a flatter, more muscular chest. The disappearance of their weight feels strange, a loss of a familiar part of yourself that sends a pang of uncertainty through you.

Almost simultaneously, a bulge forms in your lower abdomen. It's a peculiar feeling, not unlike a muscle flexing and unflexing, but situated in a place where no muscle has existed before. As your vagina disappears, it is replaced by a growing appendage, a $mc.penisCor inch penis, proportional to your previous breasts.

You tentatively touch this new part of your anatomy, taken aback by the firmness of it, the heat emanating from it. It's a foreign sensation but not an entirely unpleasant one. A simple brush of your hand sends a rush of unfamiliar pleasure coursing through you, a sensitivity you didn't anticipate.

As the reality of your transformation settles, your hands wander over your new form. The absence of your breasts is jarring, replaced by a flat, firm chest. The newly formed penis is an oddity you find yourself fascinated with, the changes making you feel both powerful and vulnerable at the same time.

What will this mean for your future in the Abyss? Will you be stronger, faster, more resilient? Or will this new form bring its own set of challenges? Will your comrades accept you, or will they view you with suspicion? It's a terrifying uncertainty, but you can't afford to let your fear hold you back.

Standing tall, you brace yourself for the journey ahead. The Abyss has changed you, but it has not defeated you. You're not quite the woman you once were, but inside, you're still the same fearless explorer. Your body may have changed, but your spirit remains unbroken, ready to face whatever the Abyss throws at you next.

In the midst of your journey through the second layer, a peculiar sensation seizes you; it starts as a dull ache in your lower belly and quickly escalates into a throbbing, almost unbearable pain. It's as if something within you is trying to escape, to burst forth into existence. Sweat pours down your face, dripping onto your chest.

Simultaneously, a pressure builds in your chest. Looking down, you see your flat pecs swelling, stretching, and forming into round $mc.breastsLabel breasts. The size is proportionate to your endowment, each pulse of the Curse adding more to their fullness. Your fingers trace the curves, the sensation of the soft flesh and the erect nipples sending another jolt through your body. You're simultaneously awed and terrified by the sudden transformation.

Suddenly, the tension is released, and you are left panting, your body slick with sweat and rainwater. As you look down, your eyes widen at the sight. Your $mc.penisCor inch penis is still present, but there's an addition. A soft, sensitive mound has formed just beneath it, the unmistakable shape of a vagina. It feels... new. Delicate. Responsive to every breeze, every drop of rain that hits it.

A strange mix of fear and excitement fills you as you consider the implications. The Curse has left you with a unique anatomy, one that could lead to all sorts of unusual experiences. Would this make your journey through the Abyss more dangerous or could it somehow be an advantage? As your hand instinctively reaches down, you wince at the foreign sensation, a paradox of familiarity and novelty.

You're a futa now, a combination of both sexes. With a sigh, you touch your breasts, the familiar curves now contrasting with the new addition. It's an odd mix, making you feel both powerful and vulnerable at the same time. It's a change, an alteration in the very core of your identity, and you're not sure whether to be terrified or intrigued.

Staring into the dense foliage, you try to gather your thoughts. Your life in the Abyss was already unpredictable, filled with dangers and challenges that tested your mettle at every turn. This new development, however, is an entirely different type of challenge. It changes how you perceive yourself, and possibly how the denizens of the Abyss will perceive you.

But you're a survivor. You've always been one. And if this new challenge is what the Abyss has thrown at you, then you'll face it head-on, with all the courage and resilience that's gotten you this far. The Abyss may be unpredictable, but so are you. And you're not about to let it forget that.

In the midst of your journey through the second layer, suddenly, a sharp pain stabs through your lower belly, a feeling so intense that it causes you to stagger, clutching at a nearby vine for support. The pain intensifies, becoming a hot, searing sensation that makes you grit your teeth and squeeze your eyes shut.

The pain slowly subsides, leaving you panting and weak-kneed. When you dare to look down, your breath hitches in your throat. Below your $mc.breastsLabel breasts, right where your vagina is, there's something new. A fleshy appendage, firm and sensitive to the touch. Your hand shakes as you reach down, a gasp escaping your lips as you confirm the reality. You've grown a penis, $mc.penisCor inches in length.

A flurry of thoughts race through your mind. How will this affect your journey through the Abyss? Will it be a burden, or could it possibly offer some advantage? The feel of the new organ, heavy and foreign between your legs, is disorienting. The sensation of the rain falling on it, each drop causing a tingling response, is both confusing and curiously thrilling.

You're a futa now, a combination of both sexes. With a sigh, you touch your breasts, the familiar curves now contrasting with the new addition. It's an odd mix, making you feel both powerful and vulnerable at the same time. It's a change, an alteration in the very core of your identity, and you're not sure whether to be terrified or intrigued.

[img[setup.ImagePath + _curse.pic]]

Suddenly, a sharp, stabbing sensation pierces your chest. It feels as if your very soul is being invaded by an unseen force, and you instinctively clutch at your heart. Your mind races with thoughts of the unknown, the fear of the changes that the Curse may bring. A hazy, intoxicating fog fills your thoughts, and your knees buckle as the full weight of the Curse takes hold.

The Blushing Virgin Curse now flows through your veins, causing a profound shift in your psyche. Any aspect of your demeanor that was bold or unashamed seems to vanish, replaced by a deep and overwhelming sense of vulnerability. The idea of engaging in any sexual activities or even simple nudity makes your cheeks flush with embarrassment, your heart pounding like a wild animal caged within your chest.

As you continue your journey through the Abyss, you can't help but ponder how this Curse will affect your future interactions. Will the newfound embarrassment and shame hinder your relationships with others? Will your bashful nature prove to be a barrier to deeper connections or will it make them more meaningful and intimate?

Despite the anxiety and uncertainty that grips you, you press on, trying to focus on the task at hand - exploring the mysteries of the Abyss.

[img[setup.ImagePath + _curse.pic]]

As you journey further into the second layer of the Abyss, the once drizzle from the colossal green canopy becomes a torrent. Stray droplets strike your face, a sensation akin to cool, soft kisses from an unseen admirer. But then, a sudden pinprick – not against your skin, but deep within the recesses of your mind – makes your heart skip a beat.

A sensation not unlike frostbite seizes your body. A bitter chill pulses through your veins, burning your insides in a paradoxical inferno of ice. Your knees buckle beneath the weight of the transformation.

Your muscles seize up, an unfamiliar frailty creeping into your limbs. The rough bark of the tree you're leaning against feels sharper, the heavy gear you carry seems intolerable, and the lush vegetation around you becomes a confounding maze. A sense of overwhelming vulnerability grips you, rather than the strength you once possessed. A strange inability to fend for yourself sweeps over you. Your once-dependable navigation skills, your ability to climb, to fight – all evaporate into the miasma.

A new sensation sparks inside you – an intoxicating allure towards danger, an almost magnetic pull towards perilous situations. It's a whispering voice in your mind, a throbbing pulse in your veins: the desire to be saved, to be rescued. Your heart flutters as you realize: you have become the eternal damsel-in-distress.

A soft gasp leaves your lips as you realize the most bizarre change of all. Your name – the identity you had for all these years – fades away, replaced by the all-too-familiar moniker. 'Princess.' The word resonates within you, and it is your true name now.

You are still you, and yet, not. You are a Princess lost in the heart of the Abyss, waiting for your hero.

:: Pick up the Firmament Pigment [layer2]
<<CollectRelic $relic10>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

After many hours of trudging through the second layer of the Abyss, you feel a change in the atmosphere. A notable quietness falls upon the dense thicket, only broken by the pitter-patter of water droplets falling from the canopy above. You pause, taking a moment to wipe the dampness from your forehead. As you straighten, your gaze falls on a vine-wrapped entrance to a cavern, nestled snugly in the base of an enormous tree. The cavern, made visible by a stray beam of light breaking through the thick foliage, promises a departure from the oppressive density of the jungle.

As you step into the cavern, you're met with an echoing silence, an unexpected sanctity inside the chaos of the Abyss. The ground under your boots is no longer the damp and knotted roots, but surprisingly, a smooth, granite-like surface. Strange luminescent fungi, unlike anything you've ever seen, clings to the walls and ceiling of the cavern, casting a soft, otherworldly glow.

Intriguingly, the cavern walls are covered in meticulous drawings and symbols, seeming to tell a story older than time. In the center of it all, standing on an intricate pedestal carved from the same granite-like material, you find a bucket filled with a mysterious, shimmering substance - the Firmament Pigment.

The paint in the bucket twinkles and dances, perfectly mimicking the night sky outside the Abyss. It seems to beckon you. As you lift the bucket, the celestial patterns within it shift and change, following your movements and the changes in the zenith above. As if in response to the Firmament Pigment's displacement, the luminous fungi flicker, creating an eerie, shimmering mirage around you.

Using a worn-out brush you find nearby, you dip it into the Firmament Pigment. The moment the bristles touch the liquid, they light up, becoming an extension of the night sky trapped within the bucket. Your heart races with anticipation as you take the brush to the granite wall of the cavern. A single stroke, and the wall comes alive. An animated display of the starry night unfolds right before your eyes, sparkling and shifting in accordance with the cosmos above.

Suddenly, the whole cavern is bathed in starlight, as if you've brought the heavens themselves into the second layer of the Abyss. A sense of accomplishment fills you. You’ve discovered and retrieved the Firmament Pigment, ready to bring a piece of the cosmos back to the surface.

:: Pick up the Pearly Gates [layer2]
<<CollectRelic $relic11>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

The thorny path ahead of you is shadowed, sunlight filtering down through the thick overhead foliage in small, scattered patches. It seems as though the jungle pulsates with a rhythm of its own, a chorus of croaks, chirps, and distant growls setting a primeval symphony. The path narrows even further and the undergrowth gives way to a large, formidable tree, its bark weathered and gnarled with time. Puzzlingly, a natural archway is formed by the tree's roots, reminiscent of a gateway into another world.

As you approach the archway, you notice a peculiar characteristic: dewdrops, reflecting light like tiny prismatic gems, are dripping not from the dense foliage above, but from the gaping mouth of the tree arch. It's as though the tree is weeping, creating a cascading curtain of shimmering droplets. The dew converges at the base of the tree, creating a swirling, small-scale tempest that forms a barrier of sorts.

Just beyond the watery veil, a small pedestal of interwoven vines can be seen. Atop the pedestal lies an ordinary-looking toothbrush - a bizarre contrast to the ancient, mystical surroundings. The item seems so bizarrely mundane in such an exotic environment, yet there's a quiet air of majesty to it. You recognize it as the Pearly Gates.

Your heart rate quickens in excitement. This is the moment you've been preparing for. You brace yourself, extending a hand through the barrage of water. It's colder than you expect, tingling with a kind of vibrational energy that raises the hairs on your arm. You grip the toothbrush handle, its surface smooth and reassuring.

As your fingers curl around it, the water barrier subsides instantly, the downpour of dewdrops ceasing, as if the forest itself acknowledges your claim on the Relic. You pull back your hand, holding the Pearly Gates in your grasp. As it touches the dry air, you can smell the faint scent of mint wafting up to your nose. You give a sigh of relief - your teeth, and the teeth of many others, will thank you for your efforts.

Pulling away from the now silent tree gateway, you embark back on your journey, braving the thicket with a renewed sense of determination.

<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

You traverse deeper into the dense labyrinth of the second layer of the Abyss. Your heart pounds, the rhythmic beat echoed by the patter of raindrops cascading from the thicket above.

Slowly, your eyes adjust to the dim light filtered through the leaves overhead, allowing you to notice an unexpected clearing ahead. Upon reaching it, you see a massive stone statue of a muscular figure standing proudly at the center, completely dwarfing you. It holds a small metallic barbell in its stone hands, evoking an awe-inspiring sense of strength and resilience.

Curiosity drawing you closer, you circle the statue. The detailed veins on the arms, the abs carved with meticulous precision, and the proud expression on its face tell tales of hard work and diligence. Suddenly, your gaze is fixated on the metallic barbell it holds. It appears almost identical to the World Stone's description.

Carefully, you attempt to climb the statue. The slippery surface, wet from the constant drizzle, challenges your grip. After a few tries, you manage to haul yourself onto the statue's outstretched arm, wrapping your arms tightly around the cold stone bicep.

Reaching for the stone barbell, you manage to pry it from the statue's hand. The barbell feels oddly weightless. As you adjust your grip, you notice the weight increase, conforming to your capability and intention. This is it. This is the World Stone.

Heart pounding with triumph, you slide down from the statue, the Relic in your grasp. 

<b>You can try working out with this Relic. It can both improve your muscle tone and your carrying capacity, as long as you exercise regularly.</b>

:: Pick up the Forest's Gift [layer2]
<<CollectRelic $relic13>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

You descend deeper into the wild, verdant undergrowth of the second layer of the Abyss. Thick bramble of gnarled trunks and tangled vines are slick with the constant drizzle from above. Large eyes blink at you from within the darkness of the foliage, the Abyss's curious critters observing your progress with cautious intrigue.

In the distance, you spot a soft, golden light breaking through the emerald-green canopy, a stark contrast to the monotone ambience. Driven by curiosity, you navigate through the thorny bushes and stubborn vines, each obstacle serving only to heighten your resolve.

Eventually, you find yourself in a glade where the golden light is at its strongest. At the heart of the glade stands a majestic tree unlike any other you have seen in the Abyss. Its bark shimmers like silver and gold, its roots weaving intricate designs across the mossy earth. Yet, what truly grabs your attention is not the grandeur of the tree, but a small shrine nestled at its base.

As you draw closer, you recognize the shrine as a carving made from the tree's own roots. Embedded in the network of silver and golden roots is the Forest's Gift, shimmering with a light matching that of the tree. A simple necklace, yet an artifact of profound implications.

With your eyes set firmly on the necklace, you reach out to claim the Forest's Gift. The moment your fingers brush the Relic, a deep, ominous growl reverberates through the glade. A shadowy figure emerges from behind the towering tree, a massive beast shrouded in vines and fur.

The beast stands between you and your exit, seemingly protective of the Relic. The moment of calm that prevailed just seconds ago is shattered, replaced with an air of palpable tension.

However, you recall the powers of the Forest's Gift, its ability to communicate with animals. It's a gamble, but the necklace might be your only way out of this confrontation. You channel your thoughts towards the beast, projecting feelings of peace, understanding, and camaraderie.

The beast seems to pause, its eyes softening ever so slightly. Slowly, it steps aside, allowing you to pass, but never once breaking its gaze. It is clear that this was a test, a measure of your worthiness to bear the Relic. With a final nod to the creature, you pass, the golden light of the glade fading into the backdrop as you continue your journey.

<b>If you encounter any normal animals throughout your expedtion, this Relic may help you placate them.</b>

:: Pick up the Harmless Harmony [layer2]
<<CollectRelic $relic14>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

Suddenly, a soft glow emanates from a hidden path on your right. As you move closer, the glow brightens, and a distinct tune starts to waft through the dense foliage. It is delicate yet insistent, and it resonates with an unknown genre, a blend of adventure and anticipation.

You push past thick layers of vines and step into the clearing from where the music originates. The space is surprisingly open, a grand canopy of intertwined branches overhead creating a natural dome. In the heart of the clearing, levitating above a pedestal of intertwining tree roots, is the source of both the light and the music – the Harmless Harmony.

The harp looks otherworldly. Concentrated beams of light replace the strings, radiating a calming glow that illuminates the clearing. Each beam seems to vibrate independently, producing the enchanting melody that flows into your ears, a song of exploration and courage.

Cautiously, you approach the Relic. As you draw closer, the music subtly shifts. The notes become more pronounced, resonating with an adventurous tune that mimics the echoing heartbeats of a brave explorer. You can't help but feel a sense of excitement that matches the music’s pace. It feels as though this is your theme song, the soundtrack of your daring venture into the Abyss.

Mustering your courage, you extend your hand, your fingertips tingling as they pass through the beams of light. You can feel a distinct vibration, a mild tingle as your touch strums the Harmless Harmony. The Relic responds in kind, playing a crescendo, matching the rhythm of your heart.

As you lift the harp, the music swells, filling the clearing with a triumphant melody. You can feel it resonating in your soul, a sense of achievement sweeping over you.

With the Relic in your possession, you turn back to the dense path you've just cleared. The music adjusts again, now playing a calm and soothing tune, a balm to your tired body, matching the rhythmic patter of dewdrops around you.

:: Pick up the Umbra Trident [layer2]
<<CollectRelic $relic15>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

Your eyes catch something peculiar ahead; a pocket of unnatural darkness amidst the verdant chaos. An unassuming, shadowy cavern lays tucked away, concealed within a gnarled tree's enormous roots.

The walls of the cavern are irregular and jagged, not carved by hands, but formed through countless years of elemental erosion. A profound chill fills the air, and as you venture further, you notice the darkness growing more palpable, a palpable void that no natural light seems to pierce.

You remember the description of the Umbra Trident, a small golden fork with a unique property - it interacts with shadows. Your instinct tells you that this pitch-black cavern must be its resting place, the perfect location that aligns with its cryptic nature.

The only problem? It's impossible to retrieve the Relic in complete darkness.

From the depth of your backpack, you pull out a sturdy flashlight, clicking its button. The beam of light pierces the cavern's darkness, casting sharp, shifting shadows against the cave's craggy walls. The cave begrudgingly accepts your intrusion, the artificial light illuminating its secrets.

You step further in, the flashlight held high. And there it is. On a naturally formed stone pedestal, the tiny golden fork rests, its form barely visible, a mere silhouette against the stubborn darkness.

As you reach out, the shadow cast by the fork reacts, a dark tendril reaching out as if in defense. The real fork remains undisturbed, but its shadow dances and sways, moving away from your hand as if trying to escape. It can't be moved in the dark, not without light to control its shadow.

You maneuver the flashlight strategically, manipulating the beam to corral the shadow. Step by step, with careful precision, you guide the shadow of the Trident towards the real golden fork. The two align, and you swiftly reach out, clutching the small Relic in your hand.

The Umbra Trident - a golden fork, deceptively simple, and yet, brimming with uncanny power. A chill runs up your spine as you realize that the darkness in the cavern seems just a bit less oppressive now that the Relic is yours.

:: Pick up the Event Horizon [layer2]
<<CollectRelic $relic16>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

All around you is the incessant dripping of water from the verdant canopy above, the droplets refracting the faint light that filters down from the upper layer. The gentle drizzle slowly intensifies, culminating in a downpour akin to a monsoon shower.

Your destination? The hiding place of the Event Horizon, a Relic known to provide a solution to the unique inconveniences of sustained exploration. As you venture further into this enormous, thriving layer, you notice a subtle change in your surroundings.

The tangle of foliage gradually thins out, replaced by large, stony structures overgrown with moss and lichen. They are massive stone fingers reaching up towards the canopy, as if grasping for the sunlight that barely penetrates this deep. Here, amongst these primal monoliths, you find what you are looking for.

At the base of one of these stone structures, half submerged in a pool of luminous water, you spot a gleam. It is the Event Horizon, the bracelet. It is lodged within a small, hollow recess, guarded by a cluster of rare, color-shifting orchids, their petals changing color in time with the heartbeat-like rhythm of the falling droplets.

You reach out tentatively, drawing your hand back as a rush of vapor hisses out from the recess. A smell of ozone and ancient stone fills the air, an electric sensation prickling your skin. You recognize this as a defensive measure, a remnant of ancient, arcane technology.

Mustering your courage, you push your hand through the stinging vapor. The Relic hums against your skin, and for a moment, you feel as though you are standing on the precipice of a black hole, all existence swirling into a vortex before you. The sensation fades as quickly as it comes, replaced by a reassuring warmth. You slip the bracelet onto your wrist, and it instantly conforms to your size, snug but not restrictive.

As you withdraw your hand, the vapor subsides, and the orchids return to their rhythmic dance, unperturbed. The Relic secured, you continue your descent into the Abyss, your journey made significantly easier with the Event Horizon at your disposal.

:: Pick up the Heart-stealing Stole [layer2]
<<CollectRelic $relic17>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

The air is thick with the moisture from the never-ending rain of dewdrops, the foliage overhead a vibrant, pulsing canopy of green that blots out any sign of the layer above. The ground underfoot is uneven, pitted with hidden roots and strewn with fallen leaves. With every step, you can feel the mulch yield beneath your weight, a constant reminder of the life that thrives, unseen, under your feet.

Suddenly, a series of flickering lights catch your eye, drawing you towards them. Pushing through a curtain of drooping vines, you emerge into a small clearing filled with thousands of luminescent fireflies. They dart around you, bathing the clearing in a kaleidoscopic glow, and you feel a gentle breeze caress your face, a curious anomaly in the otherwise stagnant area.

There, at the center of the clearing, you see it – the Heart-stealing Stole. It's draped over a stone plinth, the edges gently stirring in the breeze, shimmering with an allure that belies the oppressive weight of the Abyss around it. The Stole seems almost out of place amidst the dense greenery and the wild pulse of life.

Carefully, you approach the plinth. The fireflies seem to react to your presence, their lights pulsating rhythmically, casting dancing shadows on the stone surface. Your hands, trembling with anticipation and caution, reach for the Stole. The fabric feels incredibly light against your fingers, silky to the touch, as if it's spun from the very wind that blows through this bizarre oasis.

You lift the Stole, drawing it from the plinth, and a sudden gust of wind sweeps through the clearing. The fireflies swarm around you, creating a vortex of light, and for a moment, you feel as if you've become the eye of a storm. The Stole flutters around you, its movements almost sentient, coiling around your neck with a fluid grace.

The moment the fabric settles against your skin, you feel an immediate change. The noise of the jungle around you seems to fade away. The weight of the Abyss feels somehow lighter, its oppressive force diminished. The fireflies’ glow grows brighter, their lights painting you in an otherworldly light, an echo of the allure that the Stole promises.

With the Heart-stealing Stole around your neck, you feel like the center of attention in this little corner of the Abyss, an adventurer surrounded by an audience of fireflies, the forest waiting for your next move with bated breath. A fresh wave of resolve washes over you, and you turn to face the dense underbrush, ready to press on.

<b>You may want to start wearing this Relic regularly if you have any companions, it can significantly speed up how long it takes your companions to become closer to you.</b>

:: Pick up the Effacing Asperity [layer2]
<<CollectRelic $relic18>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

You arrive at a peculiar section of the second layer. A great archway of entwined ivy branches marks the entrance, beyond which the vegetation is an even denser, almost impenetrable maze. The undergrowth here is not just dense; it appears unnaturally slick, as if coated in a thick sheen of oil. The typically verdant plant-life glows an iridescent purple, evoking the lilac hue associated with the Effacing Asperity.

The journey through this slippery labyrinth becomes progressively more challenging as you constantly slip and slide, barely maintaining your balance. The realization hits you - this is the dwelling place of the Effacing Asperity. The vegetation here has been imbued with the Relic's power, resulting in drastically reduced friction.

The undergrowth eventually opens into a circular clearing, an oasis of serenity amidst the chaos of the Abyss. At its center, lying on a bed of soft moss, is an aerosol can. Its metal surface glows with the same iridescent purple as the slick vines around you.

The Relic is unexpectedly cold to the touch, but it thrums with a sense of dormant power in your hand. You give it a little shake, hearing the faint sound of its liquid contents. A smirk plays on your lips as you press the top, releasing a puff of lilac mist that instantly clears, leaving an almost imperceptible film over the moss underneath, rendering it incredibly slick to the touch, as if all friction had been removed.

:: Pick up the Wholly Ale [layer2]
<<CollectRelic $relic19>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

As you navigate through the labyrinthine tangle of dense vegetation, the damp dewdrop drizzle that had been your constant companion begins to wane. A hush falls over the Abyss, as if you've entered a sanctum untouched by time. The dense foliage yields to a clearing; an expansive grotto within the heart of the thicket. Sunlight seeping through the canopy above reveals a verdant oasis; the air around you hums with a palpable serenity, untouched by the relentless clamor of the jungle.

In the center of the grotto stands a table carved from a massive boulder, its surface smoothed to perfection by the hands of an unseen artisan. A simple basin, rough-hewn yet elegant, rests upon it, brimming with clear rainwater.

As you approach, the grandeur of the scene dawns upon you. The dappled sunlight reflecting off the water in the basin creates a mosaic of dancing lights across the stone table, enhancing the already otherworldly ambiance. The attention to detail, the exquisite craftsmanship, it is as if the scene was specifically arranged for a Relic as extraordinary as the Wholly Ale.

Your heart skips a beat as you spot the chalice on the far side of the table. The Wholly Ale. It's smaller than you imagined, an unassuming thing. However, the simple grace of its design, the modest curves of its cup, and the delicate etching along its side speak of an unmatched craftsmanship. Despite its size, it exudes an aura of majesty that seems to command the space around it.

Gently, almost reverently, you pick up the chalice. It's lighter than you'd anticipated, yet it feels solid and substantial in your hands. You pour some of the rainwater from the basin into the chalice. In the clear vessel, the liquid takes on a shimmering quality, like liquid moonlight.

With a slight chuckle, you will the water to transform into the rich, dark ale you recall seeing seeing at a tavern once in the past. The water in the chalice changes almost instantly. The scent of hops and barley wafts up from the vessel, igniting a fond nostalgia within you.

This grotto, feels more like a peaceful shrine; a sacred space hallowed by the presence of the Relic. You pause for a moment to savor the peace before you continue your journey.

<<CollectRelic $relic20>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

Through this green maze, you begin to notice peculiar formations in the distance, jutting out and parting the thorny thicket in a manner reminiscent of human construction.

Pushing through the last stubborn branches, you stumble upon an open glade, a stunning anomaly within the wild second layer. In the center stands an incongruous structure, an ancient library seemingly untouched by the relentless growth surrounding it. Its columns and archways are robust, carved from a stone you've never seen, yet resemble. It radiates an antiquated air, humming with stories waiting to be told.

The light drizzle from the plant life above has carved rivulets into the stone, creating a labyrinth of tiny channels that bring a liveliness to the otherwise stoic structure. Nature seems to pay homage to this monument of knowledge, the rain acting as the heartbeat of the library.

As you approach, the library's doors swing open, inviting you inside. The interior is surprisingly preserved. You feel a warmth seep into your bones, an uncanny sense of familiarity wrapping you like a comfortable quilt. Walls lined with bookshelves, lovingly carved, extend beyond your sight. The air is dense with the smell of old paper, ink, and a sweet undertone of moss.

In the center of the room, a bookshelf stands apart. Its size is imposing, its wood pristine, unlike the other weather-beaten shelves. Your eyes catch a glint of something on the highest shelf - it's the Memoir Remnant. Its presence feels like a soft whisper of history that refuses to be silenced.

With a sense of reverence, you approach the Relic. When you touch it, it feels like greeting an old friend.

As you explore further into the second layer of the Abyss, the twisted maze of vegetation towers above you, casting an ever-deepening shadow on the path ahead. The atmosphere is humid, an everlasting mist of dew droplets cascading from the leaves overhead, merging into heavier droplets before pattering onto the emerald carpet below. The air is heavy with the fragrance of moss and wet bark, mingled with the exotic scent of unidentifiable flowers. Each step is slow and deliberate, as navigating this densely woven plant world demands patience and caution.

After what feels like hours, you find yourself standing before an ancient stone monolith, half-consumed by the greenery, its surface etched with undecipherable glyphs. As you draw closer, you notice an intricate carving on the monolith: an eye, strikingly similar to the description of the Gleam Dazer. An intuition stirs within you, and with a deep breath, you push away the hanging vines, revealing a hidden cavity within the monolith.

Nestled within the dark recess is a small charm shaped like an eye, glimmering in the scant light penetrating the dense canopy. The Gleam Dazer. You gently pick it up, feeling a sudden surge of energy pulsating from the Relic. As you hold it up, the charm reflects the fragmented light, creating a rainbow of color across the monolith and nearby vegetation. Its surface gleams with an otherworldly glow, and you can't shake off the feeling that it's watching, aware.

After safely storing the Relic, you continue your expedition. With the knowledge that you can always check what awaits in the layer below, your steps feel more certain. Despite the relentless green labyrinth and the ongoing drizzle, there's a newfound sense of confidence within you.

<b>You can use this Relic to see into your future and see what awaits you on the layer below the one you currently inhabit.</b>

As you wander through the foliage of the second layer, you notice the vines and foliage seem to be getting even thicker. While most of the layer seems to be a thick forest, this area feels like you're almost entering a continuous hedge, made up of strange flora that never lets up.

After every vine, there is another one behind it, slowing your progress to a crawl, even as you attempt to determine the least dense path to follow. But finally, you manage to spot it, a small clearing what seems to be a vivid purple flower just beyond the next wall of green.

Making your way through the final barrier of tangled vines, you spot the Relic — a radiant, oversized purple flower. As you step toward the brightly colored bloom, about to reach down, a voice interrupts your movement from your right.

<<say $emily>>Excuse me? Please don’t do that.<</say>>

The voice, though soft, carries a shade of aggressiveness that stops you cold. From behind a tree steps a creature covered in flowers and other foliage, a girl with skin and hair as green as the jungle around you.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Companions/emilyintro.png']]

<<say $emily>>That flower is an essential part of my collection. I would be heartbroken to see it taken away.<</say>>

You reel back in surprise, you hadn't expected the relic to already have an owner — least of all something from the Abyss...

:: Emily Take Anyway [layer2]

The plant creature doesn't seem to be a threat, its appearance is far from intimidating. So if you were quick, you could likely grab the Relic and escape before she could react. In a split-second decision, you reach down, yank the glowing flower from the earth, and dash back the way you came. When you hazard a glance back, she isn't pursuing you — instead, she stands rooted to the spot, her face filled with a solemn sadness, like she's more disappointed than angry.

As you approach the vine-encased entrance to the clearing, a massive plant abruptly unfurls, catching you off guard. Before you can react, it unleashes a cloud of spores, engulfing you. Coughing and gasping, you notice a strange sensation — your skin hardening, becoming rough. Looking down, you realize it's turning green. The plant's unexpected attack has left a Curse, transforming you into something more akin to flora than fauna.

[[You notice your changes from the Curse|Take on Cellulose Emily]]

A sharp, prickling sensation washes across your skin. It starts as a faint itch on your wrist, a bothersome tickle that demands attention.

Then, a strange feeling of stiffness moves over your body, creeping along your skin like a slow-moving wave. The softness of your skin seems to be replaced by a smooth, firm surface. Your fingers trace over your arm, as you explore the feeling of your new skin. Your skin felt like the bark of a young tree, smooth, sturdy, and... plant-like.

The Curse transforms your skin into something akin to plant matter. It's a strange sensation, being bound to the plant life. It filled you with a strange desire to be close to nature, to embrace it.

As you retreat back the way you came, you question whether this little flower was really worth the cost...

<<say $mc>>Oh! I’m sorry! I had no idea you were the owner of this Relic, I’m not a thief, I swear!<</say>>
Upon hearing your words, the plant girl's expression softens and her rigid posture relaxes.

<<say $emily>>Ahh, you must be a diver? I've seen your kind pass through here. I also know the changes that befall those who dive deeper...<</say>>
Emily seems to lose herself in thought for a moment as she stares off into the canopy.

<<say $emily>>Oh! That gives me an idea! If you're venturing deeper, perhaps you could run an errand for me? Deeper in the Abyss, there are unique flowers that grow only on those layers. If you could bring some back, I would be able to cultivate them in my garden.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>I hate to sound selfish, but what's in it for me? I can't risk my life for nothing...<</say>>
After a moment's thought, Emily responds.

<<say $emily>>That sounds fair. If you agree to this, I will let you take the Relic you desire. It might even assist you in locating the plants I need. Bring me these plants, and there might be... additional rewards for your efforts.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>Alright, deal! Uh, do you have a name?<</say>>
<<say $emily>>I was not given a name at birth like most people... But I do like the sound of Emily. You may call me that. And you can come back here to meet me, I'll be sure to keep the way clear for you. We can discuss the details of my request when you visit me later.<</say>>

<<set $emilyVisit = true>>\
<<say $mc>>I have no intention of stealing this from you, but maybe we can make a deal? There must be something I can do for you in exchange for the Relic.<</say>>
The plant girl seems to consider your offer for a few moments, appearing almost as rooted in place as the trees around you.

<<say $emily>>Perhaps there is... I take it you're a diver, if you're interested in my Relic. That must mean you plan to venture deeper. Yes, deeper in the Abyss there are unique flowers that grow only on those layers. If you could bring some to me, I could cultivate them in my garden. If you agree to do this, I will let you take my flower with you. Fulfill this task, and there may be... additional rewards for your efforts.<</say>>
She seems to smile for a moment, apparently glad that she was able to come up with a potential compromise.

<<say $mc>>Alright, deal! Uh, do you have a name?<</say>>
<<say $emily>>I was not given a name at birth like most people... But I do like the sound of Emily. You may call me that. And you can come back here to meet me, I'll be sure to keep the way clear for you. We can discuss the details of my request when you visit me later.<</say>>

Using your knowledge of the Abyss, you look around briefly before finding the Bewitcher Plants you were looking for. Carefully, you extract water from the flowers, checking it to make sure it's pure before giving it a taste.

A few tests and you can confirm you have pure water to fill your flasks with! Now is a great time to collect water for your future travels.

Its been a long journey but everything needs to end. After long contemplation, you decide that it is time to settle down and enjoy your life. With all the money you made you even had the chance to improve the lives of a lot of people. So you chose to stay on the second layer, where you could really make a difference. The first thing you needed to do was gain their trust, so you imported food from the first layer and surface. that act brings you into the good books of almost everyone and allows you to tackle the next biggest problem. The criminal activity in the second layer was even worse than expected, but you had an idea how to solve it. You talked to the mayor of the Village and after a little "donation" he allows you to start a police force. With the money you had left you founded expeditions to get more Relics which you sold to pay the police force and keep importing food. This continued some time and you became quickly the most popular person on the second layer and even got elected as the mayor. Under your rule Downcast village grow almost to twice its original size. one of your most ingenious ideas was to turn it into a beloved tourist spot. Sometimes you start to miss your old life, the excitement the adventure, and even the struggle to survive. But then you look down on the city you helped to create and remember why you gave it all up, You wanted to do good in the Abyss, and by god you did it.


:: L2 LLew LInhum HAge LDub [ending]
You are done with this.
You started so full of hope, dreams and energy, you thought with enough determination and time you would make it to the deepest part of the Abyss ... and now look at you, your spirit is broken, your money gone and your dreams dashed. And so you find yourself back in the second layer, the heavy rain hammering on you as to remind you of your failure. The only good thing that happened to you on this good forsaken journey is that you became strong or maybe you should call it cunning or perhaps experienced, it doesn't matter anyways. What counts is getting results and your Abyss experienced learned you how to get results, that's strength in itself. And you are going to use this strength to your advantage like you should have done from the start. The most important lessons that you learned are 1. Kill or be killed 2. take what you need and then a little more and 3. No regrets no mercy. The Abyss is cold and uncaring and you adapted quickly to it. So you start the rest of your life. Soon everyone knows and fears you. You are feared as one of the best mercenary or assassins, not only on the second layer but also on the first and even the surface.  Your off days are spent drinking to forget, but it never works for long since the nightmares are just a drink too much and a drink too few away, always lurking in the back of your head.


:: L2 LLew LInhum LAge HDub [ending]
After a long time wandering in the Abyss you are tired.
You have seen wonders and horrors alike and survived till now.
But you had to pay a heavy price. most of your autonomy is gone. You look down on yourself and see once again your childish body as the heavy rain of the second layer pours down on you.
But not everything is hopeless. On your grueling travels through the Abyss you made quite the fortune, making you one of the richest persons around.
But you still have the body and with that, the strength of a child, that and sporadic acts of childishness are problems you cannot overcome alone.
So you seek out the help of somebody strong who can protect you, and you find Dimitry who is willing to help you out in exchange for your coin. Dimitry lives in a slightly bigger house than common and is one of the nicest and strongest people in the second layer. It was a gamble to go to him for help but of all the people he was well known for having a soft spot for children as well as being honorable.
Soon you and Dimitry are growing closer and what began as a business deal has started to feel like a real family.
He protects you from the more unsavory people of the second layer and even trains you to hunt and fight better than before your glory days. He supports you when you wake up in the night plagued by nightmares from your old diving days. He listens to your tales about the wonders that you have seen and laughs and jokes with you. Once you are old enough again you start to hunt to support Dimitry since the money you had was long spent and once your fully grown you plan to start delving again this time to support your new family.

You don't know when it happened bur you remember you where in Downcast village when it happened. You just broke down. The Abyss had stripped you of most of you maturity and at the benefit of what? You don't know if this childlike body was finally influencing your mental state or if it was the burden of constant struggle in general, but you broke down and you broke down hard. You cried so hard that even with constant rain of the second layer it was still clear that tears were flowing freely from your eyes. At some point a man stopped in front of you and asked what the matter was, half brawling and half stuttering you explained the whole story. He listens attentively, while you pour your heart out. At some point you calmed down and he speaks up for the first time in a while. ‘So you don't have a lot of coin on you? Hmm there might be not much I can do than…' He falls quiet for a while. ‘Look kid, there is something like a kids day care just ahead. In this town we have a lot of, let's call them ‘unplanned kids' being born. Maybe they can help you out as well, that's all I offer'. You head towards the prescribed location and find an elderly lady with two younger aids looking over a bunch of kids, some even younger than you are. When you offer your last earnings for some food and shelter they look at each other but accept your offer anyway. They next few days you are looked after by them, although you get the feeling you are still being kept away from most of the kids, maybe its because they suspect you aren't a normal kid or maybe it's because they don't want trouble with the parents of the kids who get pick-up at the end of the day. But all in all you are happy that you at least have some place to stay. You even see the man that gave you the lifesaving tip a couple of times walking by, as you wave happily to him. After a while though the old lady approaches you with the bad news that they have to put you out on the street again as they can't support you without financial backing. You find yourself one the street once more, but within an hour the same man from before is in front of you again. ‘What happened?' He grunts. 'They kicked me out because I had no money anymore' you snicker. ‘How can they…?! Urgh I'll have a word with them..' and he walks off. He is back within a mere moments and he just waves you over. You don't know how he did but you were allowed back. Things changed a little after that. The man, which you learned is called Dimitry started to actually visit you and would ask how they were treating you. While you didn't care at first that you weren't allowed to play with the other kids, you still felt somewhat adult after all, you started feeling left out and complained about it to Dimitry. That was the last time you played by yourself. As years went by Dimitry suddenly said you were going home with him that night. ‘Look kid, I just like it better when I can keep an eye on you. Besides I can teach you some fighting and hunting'. You still kept going to the day care during most days as Dimitry had to, in his word, ‘make sure you and I keep a roof over our heads' but you spend more and more time with him. As you aged again and you become more proficient in the skills Dimitry learned you, you were more determined to ever to use them to pay him back. Pay him back for what you know he did for you, but also for what you suspected you didn't know he did for you.

It's dark and cold in the cave you use as a refuge.
You had an interesting time in the Abyss. You saw amazing wonders and horrifying nightmares. But you paid a steep price for your adventure, you are unrecognizable as the one who started this journey, and your monstrous appearance scares even the strongest mercenary on the second layer. So you run to this cave just outside Downcast village where you now live.
Suddenly you hear a soft voice " Are you the beast that understands the human language? or better known as the transformed adventurer?."
"how do you know me?" you ask. "My employee knows a lot." the voice answers still not showing itself. "If you have enough of this cave come to this address." And then the voice is gone, outside you find a piece of paper. Sometime later you sit before a smiling man. He is not quite fat but still a bit plump and has a long mustache. "Nice to meet you my name is mister Gerard Reed and I want to hire you as my personal bodyguard"."... Why?" is all you can muster after your initial reception surprise. "Because you look like a monster... and have to be quite strong if the Abyss blessing has progressed this far, so what do you say? You don't have to do a lot just look menacing and help with the ... business a bit. In exchange, you will have a roof over your head and food on the table ... I think that's better than a cave don't you agree?". Well, what options do you have really, So you work for Mister G. Reed and become one of his most valued ... employees sowing fear and panic in the hearts of any who would oppose him.

They say money and power corrupt people, but they never delved into the Abyss.
No. the Abyss corrupts people and the money and power help you to cope with that, so it's only natural that you need more money.
After going around Downcast village looking to simply buy people to sate your sexual urges you suddenly find yourself in the office of mister Gerard Reed. "So word on the street is that you trying to buy people. Now tell me are you a rich addict or an over enthusiastic investor." He leans back in his big leather office chair. "A bit of both I guess," you stammer, already feeling the heat rising in your body again. "And I was hoping you could help, you see I have a specific idea..." You continue with some more determination. "Why do you think I would be interested in this idea of yours? I mainly wanted to meet you because you were kicking up dust. I don't like people kicking up dust in my little village," he says with a bit of an agitated tone. "I suggest you you use all that money you apparently have to enjoy your retirement, diver." You scrape your throat, feeling a bit desperate. "Well, I do have enough to get me started but my funds will run out rather quickly and the idea I had in mind is uh... how should I call it. It needs someone who can deal with delicate matters."
"Elaborate," Mr. Reed says with a light sparkle in his eyes and you know you have his full attention.
"Have you ever heard of the nymphs of the third layer?" "They are a myth," he says dismissively. "Not at all - I've seen them myself, all I need from you is to help me fund an expedition down to the third layer; then we capture them, sell some of them to rich assholes up on the surface... and with the rest, we can open a high-class brothel never seen on either layer or the surface. Which will make us richer and bring tourism down to this layer." "What about collateral should your expedition fail?" He says with a dark expression. "You can have all my cash," you say seriously. You actually don't care about the money anyway, or the potential revenue your business idea can generate. Ever since you got those Curses you have had an almost uncontrollable craving for sex and it seems to just get worse. Strangely enough the wealth of money you acquired has only made you pickier. A cheap whore just doesn't do it for you anymore, you need something exclusive and exotic. That's why this expedition must succeed.
After three grueling days where you have to take what you can to quench your... thirst, the expedition finally returns. You hired the best of the best, they were expensive but it was worth it and they return with six new Nymph slaves. Finally, you have something worthy on hand to quench your lust. Their beauty is beyond comparison and to you they look like living liquid gems.
After selling one to some dude on the surface you open the brothel with Mister Reed.
"Well, what did I tell you?" You ask with a grin after your first session.
"They sure are easy on the eyes and they have a lot of business potential," he says with a wicked grin on his face. You can hardly hide your own excitement. "Have you already sampled one?" Reed looks over to you with a predatory smile and a greedy glimmer in his eyes. "No, I haven't and I think I'll leave it to paying customers to sample them. More importantly, when are you planning to start the next expedition?" "Well since they are going to make us a lot of money," you say while yanking on one of the leashes around the necks of the slaves, "I think we can start our next one in 2 months. Maybe we can send them down to the fourth layer this time, the Abyss is like a garden. We just have to pluck the ripest fruits and sell them so we can continue to harvest, hahaha."
After that exchange, you return to your new slave/toy for another round of *well-deserved* stress release. Soon your brothel becomes the biggest and best visited one in all of the Abyss. You have something for every taste: Nymphs, Nomads, but also normal humans. Your hunters also managed to get Lizard girls, dog and catgirls, most of which used to be divers, and one even got two succubi after a hard and dangerous visit to the 5th layer. Now you are one of the richest people, maybe second only to Mr Reed, in the Abyss. you have your own harem of beautiful 'toys' who do anything your sick and deranged heart demands. Talk of you and your brothel even reaches the surface and while you might be reviled there, from time to time people come down and admit they are actually pretty jealous of you. Yes, you can really be proud of yourself you think while sampling the newest product for your customers. You are such a hard worker.

You see yourself standing under the cover of a dense rainforest, with great trees covering your view and continuous rain pouring down through the layers of branches and vines. Suddenly the image shifts and you see the splendor of the Relics that are available on this layer.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 3-relics.png']]

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and Curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threats that await you on the layer.

You stand on the cupboard directly over the two man, a small camera Relic in hand waiting for the perfect moment.
"Are you sure mister Reed won't find out about this?" "He is very... unkind to traitors and what you are planning is..." "He won't find out, the plan is as safe as safe can be, and afterward we'll be richer than he could ever imagine." The two men leave after checking the windows and locking the door and you start your job. You jump down from the cupboard without hurting yourself thanks to your slime-like body and look for the plans on the desk. Once you found them you use your camera to photograph them and crawl back up to the cupboard, once again using your slime-like properties. Smiling to yourself you leave through a mousehole. At first, you were devastated by your new body; you tried your best to continue your journey with your small and slimy body but in the end, you had to give up. Stranded on the second layer you cursed your fate. You survived the first month by stealing. You ended up getting crushed and squished more times than you can count but always bounced back once everyone left thanks to your slimy body. After a while, mister Reed approached you with an offer to work as a spy for him. Mister Reed is one of the most dangerous people in the upper layers of the Abyss: He has connections reaching all the way up to the surface and some rumors say even down on the fourth layer.
After a while you finally make it back to your boss. "Gerard, I finally got them," you say presenting him the camera. After working for him for many years now you are on a first-name basis with him. "Oh just what I was expecting. I take it you have undeniable proof?" "Of course, who do you think I am, some amateur? They were cunning though, it took weeks to find their headquarters."
"Well you did well. As always, I might add. You should take a break before heading out again," he says.  "I would really like to get my hands on whatever they were try to steal in the end," you muse.
"And I need to prepare a fitting punishment for them... Did they really think they could get away with trying to pin the blame on me for whatever they were after? Fools..." You just shrug your shoulders and leave. What happens next is none of your business, as long as you get paid you are happy. In the end you started to understand why some people call Curses a blessing.

	As you carefully navigate through the dense foliage of the second layer, the air is thick with humidity, and the damp, earthy scent of the jungle permeates your senses. The sound of water droplets falling from the intertwining vines above and splattering onto the ground creates a soft, rhythmic backdrop to your journey. With every step, the lush undergrowth brushes against your legs, the wet leaves leaving a trail of moisture on your skin.

	Suddenly, the air is filled with a low, guttural growl, echoing through the thicket, and you feel a shiver of anticipation run down your spine. The Baying Gourmet emerges from the shadows, its powerful legs and muscular body rippling with every movement. It sniffs the air, its flaring nostrils detecting the scent of your food rations. The beast's eyes lock onto yours, a primal hunger gleaming within them that makes your heart race.

	As the creature slowly approaches, its large nostrils flare with every breath, inhaling your scent and the aroma of your food. Its hot breath caresses your skin, a contrast to the cool droplets of water still dripping from the canopy above. You can hear the Baying Gourmet's rhythmic panting, and it sends shivers down your spine, a mix of fear and an inexplicable, overwhelming desire. You catch a glimpse of its body and notice that the beast seems to be <<if _temp===0>>male<<else>>female<</if>>.<<if _temp===0>> You may be at risk of impregnation if you have the proper body type and Curses to be compatible with it.<</if>>

	As you cautiously continue through the dense foliage of the second layer, the air is heavy with humidity, and the rich, earthy aroma of the jungle fills your nostrils. The soft pitter-patter of water droplets falling from the entwined vines above and splashing onto the ground creates a gentle, rhythmic soundtrack to your adventure. With each step, the moist undergrowth caresses your legs, the damp leaves leaving a cool, wet trail on your skin.

	Suddenly, the air is charged with a chorus of deep, throaty growls that resonate through the thicket, sending a shiver of anticipation down your spine. A group of Baying Gourmets, creatures known for their prowess and strength, emerge from the shadows, their sinewy legs and muscular bodies undulating with every graceful stride. They sniff the air, their flaring nostrils detecting the enticing aroma of your food rations. The beasts' eyes meet yours, a primal hunger gleaming within them that makes your pulse quicken.

	As the creatures gradually approach, their wide nostrils flare with each breath, savoring your scent and the fragrance of your food. Their warm breaths brush against your skin. You can hear the Baying Gourmets' steady panting, and it sends shivers down your spine, a blend of trepidation and an unexplainable, powerful yearning.

	A primal urge surges through you as you stand before the Baying Gourmet, and you decide to surrender to its animalistic desires. As the beast nears, its rough tongue licks your exposed skin, sending a wave of goosebumps and shivers coursing through your body. The sensation is both frightening and exhilarating, and your heart races with a mixture of fear and arousal.

	The creature's strong paws grip your body, the rough pads pressing against your flesh with a firm, yet surprisingly gentle touch. The Baying Gourmet's powerful, musky scent fills your nostrils as it begins to explore your body with its nose, mouth, and tongue.

	The beast's rough, warm tongue grazes over your sensitive areas, each stroke sending jolts of pleasure through your body. Its teeth nibble and bite, leaving marks that will remain for days, a reminder of your wild encounter. You find yourself giving in to the beast's primal passion, your body responding with a hunger that matches its own.

	As the Baying Gourmet continues to ravage your body, you realize that despite the beast's animalistic nature, it seems to know precisely how to drive you to the brink of ecstasy. Your breath comes in ragged gasps, and your skin is slick with sweat and the creature's saliva.

	Eventually, the Baying Gourmet releases you, having had its fill of you. Your body aches and trembles from the passionate encounter, and a mild limp reminds you of the wild beast that had its way with you. But deep down, a part of you craves the primal passion of the encounter and the raw, unbridled pleasure you experienced in the arms of the Baying Gourmet.

<<elseif $variation === 1>>\
	As you find yourself surrounded by the multiple Baying Gourmet creatures, a primal urge surges through you, and you make the daring decision to surrender to their animalistic desires. The air is heavy with the musky scent of the beasts, and you feel both frightened and exhilarated.

	As the creatures draw nearer, their rough tongues eagerly lick your exposed skin, each stroke sending a wave of goosebumps and shivers coursing through your body. The sensation is a potent mix of fear and arousal, causing your heart to race and your breath to hitch in anticipation.

	Their strong paws grip your body, the rough pads pressing against your flesh with a firm, yet surprisingly gentle touch. The Baying Gourmets' powerful, musky scent fills your nostrils as they begin to explore your body with their noses, mouths, and tongues, leaving a slick trail of saliva in their wake.

	The beasts' rough, warm tongues skillfully graze over your sensitive areas, each caress sending jolts of pleasure through your body. Their teeth nibble and bite, leaving marks that will remain for days, a vivid reminder of your wild and untamed encounter. You find yourself giving in to their primal passion, your body responding with a hunger that matches their own.

	As the Baying Gourmets continue to ravage your body, you're struck by the realization that despite their animalistic nature, they seem to know precisely how to drive you to the brink of ecstasy, perhaps due to a hunger for your sexual fluids, which they happily lap up. Your breath comes in ragged gasps, and your skin is slick with a mixture of sweat and the creatures' saliva.

	Finally, the Baying Gourmets release you, having had their fill of your body. Your limbs ache and tremble from the passionate encounter, and a mild limp serves as a constant reminder of the wild beasts that had their way with you. But deep down, a part of you can't help but crave the primal passion of the encounter and the raw, unbridled pleasure you experienced in the embrace of the Baying Gourmets.

A minor collision between two individuals on the crowded pathway escalates quickly into a heated exchange, their voices rising above the constant drum of rain. Just as suddenly as it began, the confrontation dissolves; they part ways, blending back into the flow of somber figures moving through the mist.<br><br>

<p>As you step into the inn, the air shifts from the relentless dampness outside to a stifling, moist warmth that clings to your skin. The room is dimly lit, the only sources of light being a few flickering candles and the dull glow of a fireplace struggling against the damp. The walls, partially made of rough-hewn wood and patches of bramble woven into the structure, seem to groan under the weight of the persistent rain. Sparse furnishings dot the room, each piece bearing the marks of overuse and makeshift repair. The atmosphere is thick with the scent of wet wood and a faint, unidentifiable odor that you decide not to dwell on.<br><br>

The questions seemed endless. There was even one question about genital size, which seemed a bit inappropriate, to be honest.<</say>><br>
    Reed lets out a loud, bellowing laugh.<br><br>
    <<say $Reed>> Haha, same old, same old, it seems. They want to have a record of everything, down to the amount of dust particles under your shoes that you bring into the Abyss. It can be quite cumbersome indeed, but sometimes it's also quite handy, which brings me to my business proposition.<</say>><br>
    He leans towards you with a wide grin.<br><br>
    <<say $Reed>> You see, they also keep a lot of records on themselves, and I would be quite interested to see those. In a way, it's only fair if they can also see all our information, right?<</say>><br>
    <<say $mc>> I guess, but then why do you need me?<</say>><br>
    <<say $Reed>>Cutting to the chase, I like that. Well, to be honest, I'm a bit bound to this village and that information is in the municipal office in Outset Town, you know, the administrative building. I would like you to bring it to me, nothing more and nothing less. In return, I'll of course reward you with some dubloons, but more importantly, I could also help you find things, like a Relic you want back from somebody, for example.<</say>><br>
    Reed gives you that predatory big grin again.<br><br>
    <<say $mc>>I don't know, I'll think it over.<</say>><br>
    <<say $Reed>>Oh, no pressure. But if you're done thinking it over, it's a beige folder labeled 'Public Service Employees' Personal Files'. It's quite big and should be in one of the file cabinets in the archive room of the building. I advise you against making too much of a ruckus, though. Our friends in law enforcement can be unpleasantly tenacious, if I may say so. Remember, being in my good graces is a valuable thing here. Anyway, I'm afraid I have other matters to attend to, see you soon.<</say>><br>

    <<set $visitL2RelicBuyer = true>>
    You trudge through the perpetual downpour of Downcast Village, the dense canopy above offering little respite from the relentless rain. The makeshift structures of the village loom around you, their weathered surfaces glistening in the dim light that manages to penetrate the forest ceiling.

    You spot a dilapidated shack with a crudely painted sign reading "Relic Exchange." As you approach, a figure emerges from the shadows. It's a woman with sickly green skin, her hair a tangled mess of writhing vines. Her left hand seems to be metallic and modified in some way and her right hand clutches a rust-covered device emitting an eerie glow.

    <<say $L2RelicBuyer>>Another diver, eh? Got any Relics to offload? I'll take 'em off your hands... for a fair price.<</say>>
    Her voice is raspy and hollow, like someone who had been smoking for many years, but it still had the energy of youth rather than the sickly quality you might expect. She holds up the strange device in her hand.
	
	<<say $L2RelicBuyer>>This little beauty tells me what your Relics are worth. Don't expect surface rates down here, though. We've all got to make a living in this hellhole.<</say>>
<<else>>\
    <<if $mc.inhuman < 2>>
        As you enter the ramshackle Relic Exchange, the green-skinned woman looks up from a pile of corroded artifacts, her vine-like hair twisting as she narrows her eyes at your relatively human appearance.

        <<say $L2RelicBuyer>>Well, well. A fresh looking one, aren't you. Brought any Relics to trade? Let's see what you've got, but don't expect charity. This ain't the surface, kid.<</say>>
    <<elseif $mc.inhuman < 6>>
        The Relic buyer barely glances up as you enter, her crab-like pincer clicking idly as she examines a strange artifact.

        <<say $L2RelicBuyer>>Back again, eh? Got anything worth my time? Remember, I'm doing you a favor by buying this deep. My offer's three-quarters of topside prices or 10 dubloons less, whichever works out best for you. Ain't I generous? Take it or leave it.<</say>>
    <<else>>
        The buyer's eyes light up as you enter, her vine-hair writhing with excitement at the sight of your heavily corrupted form.

        <<say $L2RelicBuyer>>Well, aren't you a sight? Bet you've got some real treasures on you. Come on, let's see what you're willing to part with. Just remember, this is Downcast. My prices reflect our... unique situation.<</say>>
    <</if>>
<</if>>\

Here in Downcast Village, you can sell your Relics for 75% of their surface value or their value minus 10 dubloons, whichever is greater. It's not ideal, but it's the only option this deep in the Abyss unless you're willing to risk the journey back up.

:: Emily Home [layer2]

Emily seems to trust you more after all you've done for her, so she leads you away from the place you've been meeting and to her true home.

After navigating through the dense vegetation, a quaint, dilapidated two-story house comes into view. Despite its obvious decay – broken windows, gaping holes in the flooring, and a missing front door, there's a certain charm to it.

<<say $emily>>Well? What do you think?<</say>>
Emily asks, her pride in her home evident.

Caught off guard by its sad state, you manage a response.

<<say $mc>>I... um... it's great! I'm just at a loss for words.<</say>>
Emily beams at your response, offering you a room on the second floor for rest.

<<say $emily>>I’m happy you like it, there is a spare room on the second floor, feel free to use it any time you need a rest from exploring.<</say>>
The new arrangement enables you to bypass potential hazards while you wait here and safely eat food she provides you while visiting Emily directly at her home.

[[Continue talking with Emily|Layer2 Emily Visit][$emilyHome = true]]

:: Emily Rest [layer2]
<<set $safeRest = true>>
You can rest as long as you wish here and will be provided clean food and water for as long as you wait. But you won't gain affection from companions, as they are getting a bit antsy to move on, rather than spend their whole time on this layer.

:: Emily Name [layer2]

<<say $mc>>So Emily, how did you come up with the name Emily? You said you liked the sound of it, but where did you hear it?<</say>>
Emily pauses for a moment, as if recalling a story from long ago and finding a way to tell it.

<<say $emily>>I spend much of my time observing the Divers who enter the second layer. There was one sweet girl named Emily who passed by my home once. She seemed kind, but I haven't seen her since she ventured deeper into the Abyss... I often wonder if she's alright.<</say>>
Her mood turns somber and her brow furrows, indicating that it may be time to change the subject.

[[Continue talking with Emily|Layer2 Emily Visit]]

:: Emily Quest Details [layer2]

<<say $emily>>I would like you to bring me three plants from deeper in the Abyss. They shouldn't be too hard to get, assuming you are choosing to descend deeper into the Abyss regardless. However, I am bound here, so I can't venture deeper to get them myself.<</say>>
She holds one finger up as she begins to explain.

<<say $emily>>First, there is <b>a small pink flower which blooms among the luminous moss of the layer below this one</b>. It is somewhat rare, so it may take a day or so of searching, but it is not especially difficult to get ahold of. It drinks in the meager light it is provided in those caves, but when exposed to higher amounts of light during the slow growing process, then it itself becomes a source of radiance. I would love to have those so that I may use them to light the the area where I live and garden.<</say>>
She holds up a second finger and continues her explanation.

<<say $emily>>Second, there is <b>a tree in the midst of the frigid layer deeper down</b>. It's bark and leaves are as white as freshly fallen snow, and it drains the miasma from the surrounding environment. Unfortunately, it has been driven nearly to extinction, as it's anti-corruption properties are very valuable. I know you could not bring me the tree itself, but if you could bring me a single seed, then I may be able to cultivate it and make it a part of my garden, eventually. Saving that species of tree is one of my dearest wishes.<</say>>
She shifts her stance slightly, leaning forward, her hands gently clasped together as if holding the very blooms she speaks of. 

Then she holds up a third finger and finishes explaining her request.

<<say $emily>>Finally, in the layer beneath the ice, there are numerous beautiful flowers that thrive in the bright light of the miasma. I would request only one in particular, a tenacious bloom which barely looks like a flower at all. It has green petals, and at first glance would seem to be only a bundle of leaves, but within it is the sweetest smell. I would love to have some for my garden, so that I may use them to scent my home. I believe <b>it grows near water</b>, which is unfortunately an uncommon sight down there, but that should give you a place to look for it.<</say>>
As she concludes her explanation her eyes have a small glint in them, eager for you to return with her requested flora.

<<say $mc>>Emily, do you have a home? Or at least a place to sleep?<</say>>
Emily turns to you, her green skin almost glowing in the dim light of the Abyss. There's a brief moment where the flowers in her hair seem to shimmer.

<<say $emily>>I have no need for sleep. The miasma in the air sustains me, so I don't require rest as humans do. I do have a home, though. I seldom use it, as I prefer the openness of nature. Perhaps one day, if you prove yourself trustworthy, I'll show it to you.<</say>>
She smiles slightly, but there's a hint of caution in her eyes.

[[Continue talking with Emily|Layer2 Emily Visit]]

:: Emily Eat [layer2]

<<say $mc>>What do you eat down here in the Abyss? Are there any foods I don't know about?<</say>>
A brief pause follows your question, the dense canopy overhead filtering light onto the forest floor in patches, casting rays of light over Emily's thoughtful expression.

<<say $emily>>I absorb the nutrients from the soil through my skin as I move around. It's... probably not a diet you would find appealing, but it's essential for my survival.<</say>>
Emily gazes thoughtfully at the rich earth beneath her feet, a slight smile touching her lips. For a moment,her green skin seems even more a part of the lush foliage that surrounds both of you.

[[Continue talking with Emily|Layer2 Emily Visit]]

:: Emily About [layer2]

Beneath the looming canopies of intertwined foliage, you gaze at Emily, your brows furrowed with curiosity.

<<say $mc>>Emily... What exactly are you?<</say>>
Emily turns her leaf-green eyes towards you, her skin almost merging with the green around you. There's a pause, as if she's carefully picking her words.

<<say $emily>>That's something I, myself, am still trying to understand. My form mimics a human's, but I believe I am only a plant. I feel a deep connection to that flower you plucked from my garden, although how it contributed to my existence remains a mystery even to me. All I know is that on its own, the flower lacks the power to create something as complex as me.<</say>>
Her voice is thoughtful and contemplative. As she speaks, she looks away, lost in her thoughts.

:: Emily Cave Flower [layer2]

You hold the small black flower up to Emily and smile. Her eyes sparkle with excitement.

<<say $emily>>Oh yes! That is the flower from the cave below!<</say>>
She leans forward and plucks the flower from your hand. Then she turns it over a few times and looks closely at its petals.

<<say $emily>>It seems that this one barely had enough light to survive, hence the dark color. But I believe that if I am careful, its offspring will be much brighter.<</say>>
Then she seems to remember that you are there.

<<say $emily>>Ah yes, and I have something to give you, $mc.name. I sincerely appreciate your help, and I thought these may be helpful on your dive. Wait here for a moment.<</say>>
Emily wanders off and seems to disappear for a few minutes as you wait for her to return with your reward. Eventually, she returns and seems to be holding 2 packs of leaves, seemingly wrapped in a sort of twine.

<<say $emily>>These are medicinal herbs. They are much more effective than herbal medicine from the surface, but they are also difficult to cultivate, so I only have a few. They should be just as effective as a medkit in treating any injuries you have.<</say>>

<<= '<img src="' + setup.ImagePath + 'Wonders/purityseed.jpeg" class="half-size">' >>

You reach into your pack and bring the small, white seed to Emily. As you hand it over, you feel a hint of miasma in your hand as it thickens in the absence of the seed. But Emily seems to be almost ecstatic with excitement.

<<say $emily>>Thank you so much! I had worried this was an impossible task!<</say>>
She turn the seed over in her hands a few times and examines it more closely, but her brow furrows in concern.

<<say $emily>>Hmm, I'm worried it may not be able to germinate. It seems to be nearly dead. I will try my best to revive it, but it will not be easy, if it is possible at all.<</say>>
She sighs, and closes her eyes for a moment, but then turns back to you.

<<say $emily>>But I will give you my reward, $mc.name. Since you have done me a great service here.<</say>>
She leaves for a few moments, but quickly returns with 5 succulent-looking fruits, which seems like miniature watermelons.

<<say $emily>>These melons have an especially high water content, and they are very delicious. While they don't have much nutricious value, they are a delicious treat and each one holds 1 day worth of water rations in it. They will last a long time without rotting, and they can help you if you ever need a source of hydration. So I thought these would be helpful for you, especially in the deep Abyss where water is scarce.<</say>>

<i>You have gained the equivalent of 5 water rations.</i>
<<set $items[1].count += 5>>\

:: Emily Desert Flower [layer2]

<<= '<img src="' + setup.ImagePath + 'Wonders/desertflower.jpeg" class="half-size">' >>

You reach out and present the leafy flower to Emily, being careful not to disturb the green petals as you hand it over to her. The overtly grassy smell is noticable even when you aren't trying to smell it though.

<<say $emily>>Oh yes! That is the flower from the desert below!<</say>>
She puts the flower up to her face and inhales deeply, a look of relaxation washing over her. 

<<say $emily>>Ah, yes, this is definitely it. The smell is wonderful, beyond anything else in my garden up here.<</say>>
You politely nod, not wanting to overtly disagree with her assessment.

<<say $emily>>Wait here for a moment. I have something that is especially important to you if you wish to dive beyond the fifth layer.<</say>>
After a few moments, she returns with your reward, a pair of delicate white flowers, which seem oddly... mundane. Not in the sense that they are ordinary, but in the sense that they seem to drink the miasma around them and exude a hint of purity, similar to the purity tree found on the fourth layer.

<<say $emily>>These are some of my prized treasures from my collection, and supposedly came from a purity tree when it was alive. Unfortunately they are unable to germinate, but somehow preserved themselves over many years. I normally would want to keep these, but I have a suspicion you are unusual and will dive deeper than almost any diver I know. So I would like to give these to you. You can crush these and consume their petals in a drink and it will help cleanse the effects of the miasma from you. I hope it is able to help you on your journey.<</say>>
After that, Emily helps you to prepare a drink with the flowers. It ends up looking like a glass of milk, but it tastes like... nothing. There is a complete absence of flavor, but somehow a sensation of rightness and warmth when you drink it. It's a surprisingly pleasant drink, given the total lack of flavor.

<<say $emily>>Thank you for bringing these beautiful gifts. I don't tend to receive many of those down here.<</say>>
As Emily takes your hand, the touch is electric, sending a jolt through your entire body that makes you acutely aware of her presence.

Emily leans in close, her breath warm and sweet against your lips as the scent of nectar fills your senses. The anticipation between you is palpable — an energy that crackles with potential, ready to ignite at any moment. Her fingers trail gently down your cheek before whispering words so soft they seem more like a caress than speech.

<<say $emily>>Let’s forget the world outside. Just for tonight. Okay?<</say>>
As Emily's lips finally meet yours in a tender kiss, it is as if all of nature has held its breath. The rain continues to patter against the leaves outside, but your mind is focused on what's in front of you.

The moss beneath you becomes plush and inviting as Emily guides you down onto it, her fingers gently weaving through yours. She pulls back from the kiss just enough for you both to look into each other's eyes.
<<if $mc.penisCor > 0>>
With deliberate slowness, she starts undoing your pants while gazing deeply at you, her fingers tracing along the outline of your erection through the fabric. The sensation sends a ripple of pleasure coursing through you — a prelude to what's to come. As she finally reveals your hard cock to the open air, it stands tall against the backdrop of her modest home.

Her eyes never leave yours as Emily wraps her hand around its base before slowly stroking upwards, causing a low groan to escape from deep within you. The contrast between her cool touch and the heated desire coursing through your body is exquisite. 

Emily leans in again, placing soft kisses along your chest as she continues to stroke you with expert precision. Your body responds eagerly, arching towards her hand, seeking more contact and stimulation from this plant-like woman.

Her kisses drift lower until she reaches your belly button, pausing there momentarily before continuing onwards, leaving a trail of wetness in their wake. As Emily takes your cockhead into her mouth, the sensation is unlike anything you've ever experienced: hot and wet with just enough pressure to make every nerve ending sing.

You thrust upwards instinctively but are met by gentle resistance as Emily maintains control. The rhythmic bobbing motion, coupled with the suction from her mouth, sends shivers down your spine and sets off a series of moans escaping past clenched teeth.

As Emily continues to work her magic on you, every muscle in your body begins to tense as the climax draws nearer. And then, just when you think you cannot bear it anymore, Emily picks up her pace even further, pushing you over that edge as your orgasm crashes down upon you in waves of blissful intensity — your body convulsing uncontrollably beneath the onslaught.

As the last remnants of your orgasm fade away, Emily crawls up beside you on the mossy bed, her eyes locked onto yours as if searching for something profound within their depths. In that moment, there are no words needed; they would merely dilute your connection.

Together you lay there, basking in each other's presence as the sounds of nature continue around you.

Your breasts rise and fall rapidly as anticipation takes hold. As her fingers trail gently down your arm, they eventually reach the delicate curves of your breast beneath your shirt; a soft caress sends shivers throughout your body and heightens your senses even further.

With deliberate slowness, she begins to undo your top while gazing deeply into your eyes. The sensation of her fingers tracing along the outline of one of your breasts through the fabric is exquisite.

Her touch becomes bolder, slipping beneath your bra to cup and caress the soft mound of flesh that rests there. The contrast between her cool fingers against your heated skin is electrifying; every touch ignites another wave of pleasure coursing through you like wildfire.

Emily leans in again, placing soft kisses along the curve of your breast before taking one taut nipple into her mouth. Her lips surround it gently but firmly as she flicks her tongue against its sensitive tip — leaving you gasping for breath.

You arch towards her, seeking more contact and stimulation from her, meanwhile her hands continue their exploration of your body while she maintains her rhythmic assault on your breasts with her mouth and tongue. 

When she finally moves lower still and begins to explore your sensitive inner thighs with gentle caresses, it's clear where this is headed next.

Emily pauses momentarily before gently spreading your lips apart with her fingers, revealing the delicate petals of your pussy beneath; she gazes at it as if studying an exquisite work of art.

<<say $emily>>It's almost like a flower, isn't it?<</say>>
Emily looks up at you and smiles, then you watch her lean forward until the tip of her tongue touches the most sensitive spot just above your clit; she circles it gently before flicking against it with surprising precision — a move that sends shivers down to your toes and almost makes you cry out in pure pleasure.

Her fingers continue to tease at your folds, parting them ever so slightly as her tongue slips deeper into you; every stroke is slow yet purposeful. Soon enough, she takes your swollen nub between her lips and begins sucking softly while continuing her rhythmic strokes with her tongue; the contrast in sensations is almost overwhelming: soft suction mixed with wet heat combined with cool air — the combination leaves you gasping for breath.

As she continues to work her magic, your hips begin to move instinctively against her face as if guided by an unseen force; each thrust brings Emily's lips and tongue into greater contact with the sensitive nerves within your pussy. Then the rhythm picks up speed, driven by a primal need for release; you can feel yourself getting closer and closer until finally... you explode into an orgasm that leaves you breathless.

In the aftermath, Emily crawls up beside you on the mossy bed, her eyes locked onto yours as if searching for something profound within their depths. In that moment, there are no words needed; they would merely dilute your connection.

Together you lay there, basking in each other's presence as the sounds of nature continue around you.

:: Emily Giddy Reaper [layer2]

You approach Emily, holding out the Giddy Reaper for her to see. Her eyes widen with curiosity as she examines the unique sickle.

<<say $mc>>Emily, I have something I think you might find interesting. It's called the Giddy Reaper.<</say>>
Emily's leafy hair rustles slightly as she leans in for a closer look.

<<say $emily>>Oh my, what an intriguing Relic! What does it do?<</say>>
You explain the Giddy Reaper's properties to Emily, watching as her expression shifts from curiosity to excitement.

<<say $mc>>Would you like to try it out in your garden?<</say>>
<<say $emily>>I'd be delighted! This could be incredibly useful for my plants, especially some of my herbs which usually grow quite slowly.<</say>>
Emily leads you to a section of her garden where various medicinal herbs grow in neat rows. She carefully takes the Giddy Reaper from you and approaches a lush patch of herbs.

<<say $emily>>Let's see what this marvelous little tool can do.<</say>>
With a swift motion, Emily cuts a swath through the herbs. To both of your amazement, the cut stems immediately begin to regrow. Tiny green shoots emerge from the soil, rapidly elongating and unfurling leaves. Within minutes, the harvested area is completely replenished, looking as if it had never been touched.

<<say $emily>>Incredible! It's like watching a whole season's growth in mere moments!<</say>>
Excited by the results, Emily continues to harvest more herbs, each time watching in wonder as they regrow instantly. After gathering a substantial amount, she turns to you with a beaming smile.

<<say $emily>>$mc.name, this Relic is truly remarkable. It allows me to harvest as much as I need without depleting my garden. I can't thank you enough for sharing this with me.<</say>>
She carefully bundles the harvested herbs, selecting the best specimens. When she's finished, she presents you with two large, neatly wrapped packages. Emily's eyes sparkle with genuine gratitude as she hands them to you.

<<say $emily>>Please, take these as a token of my appreciation. These are some of my most potent medicinal herbs, and thanks to the Giddy Reaper, I can spare more than usual. They should be equivalent to two of your surface world medical kits.<</say>>

<i>You have gained 2 medkit equivalents.</i>
