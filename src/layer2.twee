<<include "GeneralTimeSetup">><<include "GeneralTimeStats">>
As you enter the second layer, the clear open fields of the first gradually give way to a convoluted mass of trees, vines, and thorns, a thicket more dense than any you've ever seen. You proceed further down, the inscrutable tangle of plant matter growing taller and taller above you, eventually completely shielding the first layer from view. You feel a light pinprick on your nose and look up, thinking it to be rain, but no - these drops are falling from the plants above you, tiny dewdrops coalescing on the vines, falling down as a light drizzle at first, gathering yet more water as they fall through the enormous jungle, and finally reachiing the roots of some of the tallest trees as a veritable monsoon.

This layer is filled with a very dense growth of vines, bushes, and other plant life that impedes you and makes movement very time-consuming. Having a way to clear them out of your way would make navigation much easier. Subtract 1 day from every time on this layer (including the cost of going up or down layers) if you have a sword with you to cut through the flora.

	The dew continually drips down around you, creating the illusion of a rainstorm without clouds. The atmosphere is heavy, partially with humdity, but mainly with the ever-present, creeping corruption of the miasma.

		Above you, a blood-curdling screech fills the air. Freezing in fear, a bird seems to fly from the canopy above you, paying no mind to you on the ground. Strangely, it looks almost like a hawk, but as if its mouth were turned sideways and it's wings were a bit too sharp-edged to match any bird you've seen before. However, you don't get a chance to get a good look at it before it flaps it's wings and and leaves you once again with only the sound of the dripping rain. <br><br>
	<<elseif $layerTemp == 2>>
		At one point along your path, you spot a tangle of vines that seem to rustle slightly, but upon further inspection there is nothing inside them. After spending a minute watching them, you realize the sound comes from the speed at which the vines are growing, which seems to be a few centimeters a minute. You also hear a crunch, which seems to originate from the long-deadbskeleton of a small mammal being crushed by the vines. Wisely, you decide to move on and conclude this would not be a good place to make camp. <br><br>
	<<elseif $layerTemp == 3 && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Saeko") && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Lily")>>

		<br><br>
		<<say $companionSaeko>>Wait, we have to go around here. I'm not sure what would make a sound like that here, but I suspect it's not a good idea to find out.<</say>><br>

		<br><br>
		<<say $companionLily>>I don't know either! I really want to find out though! It can't be that bad if it's only on the second layer, right?<</say>><br>
		Saeko grabs her collar and sighs.
		<br><br>
		<<say $companionSaeko>>I believe I heard of a certain diver who thought similarly, but he was lost a few years ago. Better not to fall prey to some unkown venomous creature here.<</say>><br>
		Lily hesitates, but eventually agrees and your group ends up going around the potential threat.<br><br>
	<<elseif $layerTemp == 4 && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Cherry")>>
		A small feline-looking creature approaches you and gives a little mewling sound. As you hesitate with how to react, Cherry bends down and rubs it behind one of its furry ears. Her expression is blank and she sighs as the feline mews, whispering under her breath.
		
		<<say $companionCherry>>I remember this being fun. Why isn't this fun anymore?<</say>>
		She stands up and steps back, giving you a chance o touch the feline, feeling that it feels much softer than you'd expect, as if it were a sack of blubber rather than a cat. But after a few minutes, it gets tired of your touches and tightens up as it scampers away. Cherry is staring at the sky, letting the rain run down her face with no resistance. <<if $hiredCompanions.includes("Maru")>>Maru walks over to her and gives her a big, warm hug, but despite reaching her arms around him, her expression never changes.<</if>><br><br>
	<<elseif $layerTemp == 5>>
		You stumble upon a tranquil, crystal-clear pond, with bioluminescent plants casting a soft, otherworldly glow upon its surface. The gentle hum of insects creates a soothing melody, accompanied by the occasional splash of leaping fish as they break the water's surface. As you draw closer, you notice that the fish are adorned with vivid, iridescent scales, shimmering like living gemstones under the luminescent light. You are momentarily entranced by this serene oasis, a welcome reprieve from the dangers you've faced thus far. However, you remind yourself to remain vigilant and continue on your journey, with the memory of the pond's enchanting beauty etched in your mind. <br><br>

<<if $mudHunt == 1>>You and Maru stroll through the dripping rainforest of the second layer on a search for Mudgrazers. Maru had explained that he believed he could make a tasty dish with their meat, so you traveled with him to collect some. <<if $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Khemia")>>And this time Khemia is following behind you to keep you safe from any threats in the forest.<</if>>

Maru crouches through some ferns and you follow as he gestures at some large indentations in the mud. 

<<say $companionMaru>>They should be just over here, but we need to be quiet so no Baying Gourmet comes and steals the meat when we kill it.<</say>>

<<if $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Cloud")>><<say $companionCloud>>I can take the shot. I'm experienced enough to kill it efficiently. Unless you would prefer to do it, Maru?<</say>>
Maru shakes his head vigorously at the suggestions.

<<say $companionMaru>>No thank you! I'm not a fan of the hunt and I probably couldn't hit it anyway!<</say>>
Cloud nods and expertly line up the shot before pulling the trigger, and his shot to the head leads to an instant death. The beast was dead before it's body had even hit the ground. Cloud smiles slightly at the expression of his skills, but somehow the smile seems more solemn than joyous.
<<else>><<say $mc>>Do you want to take the shot? Or should I do it?<</say>>
Maru shakes his head vigorously at the suggestions.

<<say $companionMaru>>No thank you! I'm not a fan of the hunt and I probably couldn't hit it anyway!<</say>>
You nod and line up the shot before pulling the trigger, bringing the lumbering beast to the ground after a brief struggle for survival.
<</if>>
The other md grazers in the herd rapidly dash away with speed that is surprising for creatures of their size, illustrating why it is unwise to hunt them withhout a gun.

<<say $mc>>So, Maru, you know how to butcher this thing?<</say>>

<<say $companionMaru>>I think so. It won't be perfect, but it should still be tasty!<</say>>
With that, you work together to pull the corpse back to your nearby camp so you can feast for the night. When you return to camp, Maru seems hesitant, but competently slices the meat into manageable chunks. He takes some choice cuts and brings them over the fire he started. Meanwhile he collects some other large pieces of meat, which seem to be too touch to eat, and places them in a bowl near the edge of the camp.

After a few minutes of cooking, Maru brings you a Mudgrazer steak and eagerly awaits your reaction. After you take your first bite the flavor hits you instantly, it's as if you had distilled the flavor of beef, pork, and chicken and condensed it into an almost overwhelmingly meaty dish. It really is a unique flavor, yet it also feels familiar. Maru smiles at your reaction and begins his own meal.

After a few minutes you're interrupted by a growling at the edge of the camp. A Baying Gourmet has arrived! You tense up and prepare for a fight, but Maru stops you.

<<say $companionMaru>>Wait! I left some food over there for him. They leave us alone if we give them food, so for tonight it should be ok. He'll leave when he's full so we're safe for tonight at least.<</say>>

You notice the Gourmet is happily munching the meat Maru left in the bowl by the edge of camp, paying no mind to you or anyone else. You sigh and begin once again finishing the meal Maru has prepared for you.
<<else>>You and Maru stroll through the dripping rainforest of the second layer on a search for Flanberries. Maru had explained that they were delicious when he had eaten them before, so he reccomended getting some more of them here.

<<say $mc>>So if these berries are so delicious, why don't people eat them on the surface?<</say>>
Maru frowns and pauses to answer you.

<<say $companionMaru>>There's a few reasons. The main one is that food from the Abyss rots super fast when you remove it from its native layer, so it wouldn't survive longer than a day on the surface, so people don't usually get a chance to bring it up even if they try to. Also, if you pick the unripe ones then it can have side effects... And not many people know the difference.<</say>>

<<say $mc>>So how do you tell the difference between the ripe and unripe ones?<</say>>
Maru giggles and smiles at you.

<<say $companionMaru>>Well, I don't, but the side effects aren't too bad, so it's worth the risk.<</say>>
Maru leads you to a managed glade that seems to have people there who actually own it! Maru briefly discusses something with the guards before coming back to you.

<<say $companionMaru>>The berries here are owned by some big guy in the village near here, but he said it's ok if we take just enough for us since we're divers and we won't be here too long anyway. And he said that maybe you could even move here and enjoy his generosity as a permanent resident. I told him not to have any expectations about that though.<</say>>
Maru begins to pick any of the red berries he sees, with a preference for the shiny, red ones.<<if $abyssKnow == 1>>But you notice a few times he grabs some of the unripe, unsafe berries and puts them in the bundle. Luckily, due to your knowledge you're able to take them out before anyone eats them. Who know's what would have happened if you weren't here.<</if>>

Once you're done with the berry picking, you head back to camp with Maru, where he smashes many of the berries into a paste and adds a small amount of other herbs that he must have grabbed along the way. When he's done it looks like he has a nice pudding with some whole berries mixed in for texture. He offers you the dish to try it.

The pudding taste surprisingly like normal pudding, or flan, even with the limited ingredients he had. It seems like a slightly nutty sweet custard, but red. It's absolutely delicious and you can see that Maru is savoring the flavor himself as he smiles and digs into his own bowl. You can't help but smile at him as you share the tasty meal with your party.<</if>>

After spending a few days seeking out the statue you heard may grant you a boon on this layer, you find it past a glade surrounded by dark, foreboding trees.

As you place your hand on the alabaster hand of the demonic statue before you, a shiver runs through your spine. You have a sense that the corruption is closing in on you, and for a moment you feel acute claustrophobia. But after another moment it passes, and as long as you keep your corruption above 0, you should be fine and come out on top of this deal.

	As the erection gradually subsides, you find yourself shifting awkwardly, seeking a comfortable position to accommodate your member, which insists on staying at a larger size than you're used to.

The Abyss won't release you that easily. Once a month, an overpowering carnal craving will seize you, driving you to the brink of surrender.

As the realization dawns, you acknowledge the irresistible force of nature that you will become. The potent hormones coursing through your veins will shatter your self-control and obliterate your rationality.

Using your knowledge of the Abyss, you look around briefly before finding the Bewitcher Plants you were looking for. Carefully, you extract water from the flowers, checking it to make sure it's pure before giving it a taste.

A few tests and you can confirm you have pure water to fill your flasks with! Now is a great time to collect water for your future travels.

Its been a long journey but everything needs to end. After long contemplation, you decide that it is time to settle down and enjoy your life. With all the money you made you even had the chance to improve the lives of a lot of people. So you chose to stay on the second layer, where you could really make a difference. The first thing you needed to do was gain their trust, so you imported food from the first layer and surface. that act brings you into the good books of almost everyone and allows you to takel the next biggest problem. The criminal activity in the second layer was even worse than expected, but you had an idea how to solve it. You talked to the mayor of the Village and after a little "donation" he allows you to start a police force. With the money you had left you founded expeditions to get more Relics which you sold to pay the police force and keep importing food. This continued some time and you became quickly the most popular person on the second layer and even got elected as the mayor. Under your rule Downcast village grow almost to twice its original size. one of your most ingenious ideas was to turn it into a beloved tourist spot. Sometimes you start to miss your old life, the excitement the adventure, and even the struggle to survive. But then you look down on the city you helpt to create and remember why you gave it all up, You wanted to do good in the Abyss, and by god you did it.

You are done with this.
You started so full of hope, dreams and energy, you thought with enough determination and time you would make it to the deepest part of the Abyss ... and now look at you, your spirit is broken, your money gone and your dreams dashed. And so you find yourself back in the second layer, the heavy rain hammering on you as to remind you of your failure. The only good thing that happened to you on this good forsaken journey is that you became strong or maybe you should call it cunning or perhapse experienced, it doesn't matter anyways. What counts is getting results and your Abyss experienced learned you how to get results, that's stremgth in itself. And you are going to use this strength to your advantage like you should have done from the start. The most important lessons that you learned are 1. Kill or be killed 2. take what you need and then a little more and 3. No regrets no mercy. The Abyss is cold and uncaring and you adapted quickly to it. So you start the rest of your life. Soon everyone knows and fears you. You are feard as one of the best mercenary or assasins, not only on the second layer but also on the first and even the surface.  Your off days are spent drinking to forget, but it never wörks for long since the nightmares are just a drink too much and a drink too few away, always lurking in the back of your head.

After a long time wandering in the Abyss you are tired.
You have seen wonders and horrors alike and survived till now.
But you had to pay a heavy price. most of your autonomy is gone. You look down on yourself and see once again your childish body as the heavy rain of the second layer purs down on you.
But not everything is hopeless. On your grueling travels through the abys you made quite the fortune, making you one of the richest persons around.
But you still have the body and with that, the strength of a child, that and sporadic acts of childishness are problems you cannot overcome alone.
So you seek out the help of somebody strong who can protect you, and you find Dimitry who is willing to help you out in exchange for your coin. Dimitry lives in a slightly bigger house than common and is one of the nicest and strongest people in the second layer. It was a gamble to go to him for help but of all the people he was well known for having a soft spot for children as well as being honorable.
Soon you and Dimitry are growing closer and what began as a business deal has started to feel like a real family.
He protects you from the more unsavory people of the second layer and even trains you to hunt and fight better than before your glory days. He supports you when you wake up in the night plagued by nightmares from your old diving days. He listens to your tales about the wonders that you have seen and laughs and jokes with you. Once you are old enough again you start to hunt to support Demitry since the money you had was long spent and once your fully grown you plan to start delving again this time to support your new family.

You don’t know when it happened bur you remember you where in Downcast village when it happened. You just broke down. The Abyss had stripped you of most of you maturity and at the benefit of what? You don’t know if this childlike body was finally influencing your mental state or if it was the burden of constant struggle in general, but you broke down and you broke down hard. You cried so hard that even with constant rain of the second layer it was still clear that tears were flowing freely from your eyes. At some point a man stopped in front of you and asked what the matter was, half brawling and half stuttering you explained the whole story. He listens attentively, while you pour your heart out. At some point you calmed down and he speaks up for the first time in a while. ‘So you don’t have a lot of coin on you? Hmm there might be not much I can do than…’ He falls quiet for a while. ‘Look kid, there is something like a kids day care just ahead. In this town we have a lot of, let’s call them ‘unplanned kids’ being born. Maybe they can help you out as well, that’s all I offer’. You head towards the prescribed location and find an elderly lady with two younger aids looking over a bunch of kids, some even younger than you are. When you offer your last earnings for some food and shelter they look at each other but accept your offer anyway. They next few days you are looked after by them, although you get the feeling you are still being kept away from most of the kids, maybe its because they suspect you aren’t a normal kid or maybe it’s because they don’t want trouble with the parents of the kids who get pick-up at the end of the day. But all in all you are happy that you at least have some place to stay. You even see the man that gave you the lifesaving tip a couple of times walking by, as you wave happily to him. After a while though the old lady approaches you with the bad news that they have to put you out on the street again as they can’t support you without financial backing. You find yourself one the street once more, but within an hour the same man from before is in front of you again. ‘What happened?’ He grunts. ’They kicked me out because I had no money anymore’ you snicker. ‘How can they…?! Urgh I’ll have a word with them..’ and he walks off. He is back within a mere moments and he just waves you over. You don’t know how he did but you were allowed back. Things changed a little after that. The man, which you learned is called Dimitry started to actually visit you and would ask how they were treating you. While you didn’t care at first that you weren’t allowed to play with the other kids, you still felt somewhat adult after all, you started feeling left out and complained about it to Dimitry. That was the last time you played by yourself. As years went by Dimitry suddenly said you were going home with him that night. ‘Look kid, I just like it better when I can keep an eye on you. Besides I can teach you some fighting and hunting’. You still kept going to the day care during most days as Dimitry had to, in his word, ‘make sure you and I keep a roof over our heads’ but you spend more and more time with him. As you aged again and you become more proficient in the skills Dimitry learned you, you were more determined to ever to use them to pay him back. Pay him back for what you know he did for you, but also for what you suspected you didn’t know he did for you.

It's dark and cold in the cave you use as a refuge.
You had an interesting time in the Abyss. You saw amazing wonders and horrifying nightmares. But you paid a steep price for your adventure, you are unrecognizable as the one who started this journey, and your monstrous appearance scares even the strongest mercenary on the second layer. So you run to this cave just outside Downcast village where you now live.
Suddenly you hear a soft voice " Are you the beast that understands the human language? or better known as the transformed adventurer?."
"how do you know me?" you ask. "My employe knows a lot." the voice answers still not showing itself. "If you have enough of this cave come to this address." And then the voice is gone, outside you find a piece of paper. Sometime later you sit before a smiling man. He is not quite fat but still a bit plump and has a long mustache. "Nice to meet you my name is mister Gerard Reed and I want to hire you as my personal bodyguard"."... Why?" is all you can muster after your initial reception surprise. "Because you look like a monster... and have to be quite strong if the Abyss blessing has progressed this far, so what do you say? You don't have to do a lot just look menacing and help with the ... business a bit. In exchange, you will have a roof over your head and food on the table ... I think thats better than a cave don't you agree?". Well, what options do you have really, So you work for Mister G. Reed and become one of his most valued ... employes sowing fear and panic in the hearts of any who would oppose him.

They say money and power corrupt people, but they never delved into the Abyss.
No. the Abyss corrupts people and the money and power help you to cope with that, so it's only natural that you need more money.
After going around Downcast village looking to simply buy people to sate your sexual urges you suddenly find yourself in the office of mister Gerard Reed. 'So word on the street is that you trying to buy people. Now tell me are you a rich addict or an over enthousiastic investor'. He leans back in his big leather office chair. "A bit of both I guess' You stammer, already feeling the heat rising in your body again. 'And I was hoping you could help, you see I have specific idea..' You continue with some more determination. 'Why do you think I would be interesed in this idea of yours? I mainly wanted to meet you because you were kicking up dust. I don't like people kicking up dust in my little village' He says with a bit of an agetated tone. 'I suggest you you use all that money you apperently have to enjoy your retirement diver'. You scrape your throat, feeling a bit desperate. ".Well, I do have enough to get me started but my funds will run out rather quickly and the idea I had in mind is euh.. how should I call it. It needs someone who can deal with delicate maters."
"Eleborate" Mr. Reed says with a light sparkle in his eyes and you know you have his full attention.
"Have you ever hört of the nymphs of the third layer?"."They are a myth" he says dismissively. "Not at all I've seen them myself, all I need from you is help me fund an expedition down to the third layer, then we capture them sell some of them to rich assholes up on the surface, and with the rest, we can open a high-class brothel never seen on either layer or the surface. which will make us richer and bring tourism down to this layer".  "What about collateral should your expedition fail?" He says with a dark expression. "You can have all my cash" You say seriously. You actually don't care about the money anyway, or the potential revenue your buisness idea can generate. Ever since you got those Curses you have had an almost uncontrollable sex craving and it seems to just get worse. Strangely enough the wealth of money you accuired has only made you pickier. A cheap whore just doesn't do it for you anymore, you need something exclusive and exotic. That's why this expedition must succeed.
After three grueling days where you have to take what you can to quench your ... thirst the expedition finally returns. You hired the best of the best, they were expensive but it was worth it and they return with six new Nymph slaves. Finally, you have something worthy on hand to quench your lust. Their beauty is beyond comparison and to you they look like living liquid gems.
After selling one to some dude on the surface you open the brothel with Mister Reed.
"Well, what did I tell you ?" you ask with a grin after your first session.
"They sure are easy on the eyes and they have a lot of buisness potential." He says with a wicked grin on his face. You can hardly hide your own excitement. "have you already sampled one?". Reed looks over to you with predotory smile and greedy glimmer in his eyes. "No, I haven't and I'll think I'll leave it to paying customers to sample them. More importantly when are planning to start the next expedition?". "Well since they are going to make us a lot of money, "You say while janking on one of the leashes around the necks of the slaves, " I think we can start our next one in 2 months. Maybe we can send them down to the fourth this time, the Abyss is like a garden. We just have to pluck the ripest fruits and sell them so we can continue to harvest, hahahaha "
After that exchange, you return to your new slave/toy for another round of *well-deserved* stress release. Soon your brothel becomes the biggest and best visited one in all of the Abyss. You have something for every taste: Nymphs, Nomades, but also normal humans. Your hunters also managed to get Lizard girls, dog and catgirls, most of which used to be divers, and one even got two succubi after a hard and dangerous visit to the 5th layer. Now you are one of the richest persons, maybe second only to Mr Reed, in the Abyss. you have your own harem of beautiful 'toys' who do anything your sick and deranged heart demands. Talk of you and your brothel even reaches the surface, and while you might be reviled there from time to time people come down and admit they are actually pretty jealous of you. Yes, you can really be proud of yourself you think while sampling the newest product for your customers. You are such a hard worker.

You see yourself standing under the cover of a dense rainforest, with great trees covering your view and continuous rain pouring down through the layers of branches and vines. Suddenly the image shifts and you see the splendor of the Relics that are available on this layer.

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 3-wonders.png']]

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and Curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 3-curses.png']]

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threaths that await you on the layer

Finally, the vision fades, leaving you standing once again where you were before, with only a brief sense of motion sickness as you orient yourself back to your physical body. As you look at the Gleam Dazer once again, you notice the Relic is cracked and broken.

You stand on the cupboard directly over the two man, a small camera Relic in hand waiting for the perfect moment.
"Are you sure mister Reed won't find out about this ?", " He is very ... unkind to traitors and what you are planning is ... . "He won't find out, the plan is as safe as safe can be, and afterward we'll be richer than he could ever imagine". the two man leave after checking the windows and locking the door and you start your job. You jump down from the cupboard without hurting yourself thanks to your slime-like body and look for the plans on the desk. Once you found them you use your camera to photograph them and crawl back up to the cupboard once again using your slime-like properties. Smiling to yourself you leave through a mousehole. At first, you were devastated by your new body, you tried your best to continue your journey with your small and slimy body but in the end, you had to give up. stranded on the second layer you Cursed your fate. You survived the first month by stealing. You ended up getting crushed and squished more times than you can count but always bouncing back once everyone left thanks to your slimy body. After a while, mister Reed approached you with an offer to work as a spy for him. Mister Reed is one of the most dangerous people in the upper layers of the Abyss he has connections reaching all the way up to the surface and some rumors say even down on the fourth layer.
 After a while you finally make it back to your boss.
 "Gerard I finally got them" You say presenting him the camera. After working for him for many years now you are on a first-name basis with him."Oh just what i was expecting i take it you have undeniable proof ?"."Of course who do you think I am, some amateur?", "They were cunning though, it took weeks to find their headquarter".
"Well you did well. As always, I might add. You should take a break before heading out again." He says.  "I would really like to get my hands on whatever they were try to steal in the end".You muse.
"And I need to prepare a fitting punishment for them... Did they really think they could get away with trying to pin the blame on me for whatever they were after, fools..". You just shrug your shoulders and leave. What happens next is none of your business, as long as you get paid you are happy. In the end you started to understand why some people call Curses a blessing.

As you carefully navigate through the dense foliage of the second layer, the air is thick with humidity, and the damp, earthy scent of the jungle permeates your senses. The sound of water droplets falling from the intertwining vines above and splattering onto the ground creates a soft, rhythmic backdrop to your journey. With every step, the lush undergrowth brushes against your legs, the wet leaves leaving a trail of moisture on your skin.

Suddenly, the air is filled with a low, guttural growl, echoing through the thicket, and you feel a shiver of anticipation run down your spine. The Baying Gourmet emerges from the shadows, its powerful legs and muscular body rippling with every movement. It sniffs the air, its flaring nostrils detecting the scent of your food rations. The beast's eyes lock onto yours, a primal hunger gleaming within them that makes your heart race.

As the creature slowly approaches, its large nostrils flare with every breath, inhaling your scent and the aroma of your food. Its hot breath caresses your skin, a contrast to the cool droplets of water still dripping from the canopy above. You can hear the Baying Gourmet's rhythmic panting, and it sends shivers down your spine, a mix of fear and an inexplicable, overwhelming desire. You catch a glimpse of its body and notice that the beast seems to be <<if _temp==0>>male<<else>>female<</if>>.<<if _temp==0>> You may be at risk of impregnation if you have the proper body type and Curses to be compatible with it.<</if>>

:: Layer2 Gourmet Ravage
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/bayinggourmet.png']]

A primal urge surges through you as you stand before the Baying Gourmet, and you decide to surrender to its animalistic desires. As the beast nears, its rough tongue licks your exposed skin, sending a wave of goosebumps and shivers coursing through your body. The sensation is both frightening and exhilarating, and your heart races with a mixture of fear and arousal.

The creature's strong paws grip your body, the rough pads pressing against your flesh with a firm, yet surprisingly gentle touch. The Baying Gourmet's powerful, musky scent fills your nostrils as it begins to explore your body with its nose, mouth, and tongue.

The beast's rough, warm tongue grazes over your sensitive areas, each stroke sending jolts of pleasure through your body. Its teeth nibble and bite, leaving marks that will remain for days, a reminder of your wild encounter. You find yourself giving in to the beast's primal passion, your body responding with a hunger that matches its own.

As the Baying Gourmet continues to ravage your body, you realize that despite the beast's animalistic nature, it seems to know precisely how to drive you to the brink of ecstasy. Your breath comes in ragged gasps, and your skin is slick with sweat and the creature's saliva.

Eventually, the Baying Gourmet releases you, having had its fill of you. Your body aches and trembles from the passionate encounter, and a mild limp reminds you of the wild beast that had its way with you. But deep down, a part of you craves the primal passion of the encounter and the raw, unbridled pleasure you experienced in the arms of the Baying Gourmet.

Your limp after this rough encounter will increase your next <<print (4 - $statRed)>> travel times by 1 day each.
