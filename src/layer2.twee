!Layer 2 - Dewdrop Rain Underbrush
@@
\
As you enter the second layer, the clear open fields of the first gradually give way to a convoluted mass of trees, vines, and thorns, a thicket more dense than any you've ever seen. You proceed further down, the inscrutable tangle of plant matter growing taller and taller above you, eventually completely shielding the first layer from view. You feel a light pinprick on your nose and look up, thinking it to be rain, but no - these drops are falling from the plants above you, tiny dewdrops coalescing on the vines, falling down as a light drizzle at first, gathering yet more water as they fall through the enormous jungle, and finally reachiing the roots of some of the tallest trees as a veritable monsoon.

This layer is filled with a very dense growth of vines, bushes, and other plant life that impedes you and makes movement very time-consuming. Having a way to clear them out of your way would make navigation much easier. Subtract 1 day from every time on this layer (including the cost of going up or down layers) if you have a sword with you to cut through the flora.

		Above you, a blood-curdling screech fills the air. Freezing in fear, a bird seems to fly from the canopy above you, paying no mind to you on the ground. Strangely, it looks almost like a hawk, but as if its mouth were turned sideways and it's wings were a bit too sharp-edged to match any bird you've seen before. However, you don't get a chance to get a good look at it before it flaps it's wings and and leaves you once again with only the sound of the dripping rain. <br><br>
	<<elseif $layerTemp == 2>>
		At one point along your path, you spot a tangle of vines that seem to rustle slightly, but upon further inspection there is nothing inside them. After spending a minute watching them, you realize the sound comes from the speed at which the vines are growing, which seems to be a few centimeters a minute. You also hear a crunch, which seems to originate from the long-deadbskeleton of a small mammal being crushed by the vines. Wisely, you decide to move on and conclude this would not be a good place to make camp. <br><br>

		<<say $companionSaeko>>Wait, we have to go around here. I'm not sure what would make a sound like that here, but I suspect it's not a good idea to find out.<</say>><br>

		<br><br>
		<<say $companionLily>>I don't know either! I really want to find out though! It can't be that bad if it's only on the second layer, right?<</say>><br>

		<br><br>
		<<say $companionSaeko>>I believe I heard of a certain diver who thought similarly, but he was lost a few years ago. Better not to fall prey to some unkown venomous creature here.<</say>><br>

	<<elseif $layerTemp == 4 && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Cherry")>>
		A small feline-looking creature approaches you and gives a little mewling sound. As you hesitate with how to react, Cherry bends down and rubs it behind one of its furry ears. Her expression is blank and she sighs as the feline mews, whispering under her breath.
		
		<<say $companionCherry>>I remember this being fun. Why isn't this fun anymore?<</say>>
		She stands up and steps back, giving you a chance o touch the feline, feeling that it feels much softer than you'd expect, as if it were a sack of blubber rather than a cat. But after a few minutes, it gets tired of your touches and tightens up as it scampers away. Cherry is staring at the sky, letting the rain run down her face with no resistance. <<if $hiredCompanions.includes("Maru")>>Maru walks over to her and gives her a big, warm hug, but despite reaching her arms around him, her expression never changes.<</if>><br><br>
	<<elseif $layerTemp == 5>>
		You stumble upon a tranquil, crystal-clear pond, with bioluminescent plants casting a soft, otherworldly glow upon its surface. The gentle hum of insects creates a soothing melody, accompanied by the occasional splash of leaping fish as they break the water's surface. As you draw closer, you notice that the fish are adorned with vivid, iridescent scales, shimmering like living gemstones under the luminescent light. You are momentarily entranced by this serene oasis, a welcome reprieve from the dangers you've faced thus far. However, you remind yourself to remain vigilant and continue on your journey, with the memory of the pond's enchanting beauty etched in your mind. <br><br>

<<if $mudHunt == 1>>You and Maru wander through the dripping rainforest of the second layer, on the hunt for Mudgrazers. Maru had mentioned that their meat would make a delicious dish, so you accompanied him on this quest. <<if $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Khemia")>>Khemia tags along, ensuring your safety from any lurking threats in the forest.<</if>>

Maru crouches through some ferns and, gesturing at large indentations in the mud, you follow.

<<say $companionMaru>>They should be just over here, but we need to be quiet so no Baying Gourmet comes and steals the meat when we kill it.<</say>>
<<if $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Cloud")>><<say $companionCloud>>I can take the shot. I'm experienced enough to kill it efficiently. Unless you would prefer to do it, Maru?<</say>>
Maru shakes his head vigorously.

<<say $companionMaru>>No thank you! I'm not a fan of the hunt and I probably couldn't hit it anyway!<</say>>
Cloud nods and expertly lines up the shot, pulling the trigger with precision. The Mudgrazer dies instantly, its body collapsing to the ground. Cloud offers a faint smile, reflecting pride in his skills, yet somehow tinged with solemnity.
<<else>><<say $mc>>Do you want to take the shot? Or should I do it?<</say>>
Maru shakes his head vigorously.

<<say $companionMaru>>No thank you! I'm not a fan of the hunt and I probably couldn't hit it anyway!<</say>>
You nod, line up the shot, and pull the trigger. The lumbering beast falls after a brief struggle.
<</if>>
The other Mudgrazers in the herd dash away with surprising speed, demonstrating the wisdom of hunting them with a gun.

<<say $mc>>So, Maru, you know how to butcher this thing?<</say>>
<<say $companionMaru>>I think so. It won't be perfect, but it should still be tasty!<</say>>
Together, you haul the carcass back to camp for a feast. Upon returning, Maru hesitates but then confidently slices the meat into manageable chunks. He selects choice cuts to cook over the fire, while placing tougher pieces in a bowl near the edge of the camp.

Once the Mudgrazer steak is cooked, Maru hands you a piece, eagerly awaiting your reaction. As you take your first bite, the flavor is intense – a concentrated fusion of beef, pork, and chicken that is both unique and familiar. Maru grins at your response and digs into his own meal.

A growl interrupts your feast. A Baying Gourmet has appeared! You tense up, ready for a fight, but Maru stops you.

<<say $companionMaru>>Wait! I left some food over there for him. They leave us alone if we give them food, so for tonight it should be ok. He'll leave when he's full so we're safe for tonight at least.<</say>>
You notice the Gourmet contentedly munching on the meat Maru left in the bowl, paying you no mind. Relieved, you return to savoring the meal Maru prepared. As you and your companions finish eating, the Baying Gourmet ambles away, satisfied with its meal.

<<else>>You and Maru stroll through the dripping rainforest of the second layer, searching for Flanberries. Maru had raved about their delicious taste, so you decided to seek them out together.

<<say $mc>>So if these berries are so delicious, why don't people eat them on the surface?<</say>>
Maru frowns, pausing before answering.

<<say $companionMaru>>There's a few reasons. The main one is that food from the Abyss rots super fast when you remove it from its native layer, so it wouldn't survive longer than a day on the surface. People don't usually get a chance to bring it up even if they try to. Also, if you pick the unripe ones, they can have side effects... And not many people know the difference.<</say>>
<<say $mc>>So how do you tell the difference between the ripe and unripe ones?<</say>>
Maru giggles and smiles at you.

<<say $companionMaru>>Well, I don't, but the side effects aren't too bad, so it's worth the risk.<</say>>
Maru leads you to a managed glade, where the Flanberries are guarded by people who appear to own the land. After a brief conversation with the guards, Maru returns to you.

<<say $companionMaru>>The berries here are owned by some big guy in the nearby village, but he said it's okay if we take just enough for us since we're divers and we won't be here too long anyway. And he said that maybe you could even move here and enjoy his generosity as a permanent resident. I told him not to have any expectations about that though.<</say>>
Maru starts picking shiny, red berries, occasionally plucking unripe, unsafe ones.<<if $abyssKnow == 1>>Luckily, your knowledge allows you to remove them from the bundle before anyone eats them. Who knows what would have happened if you weren't here.<</if>>

After collecting enough berries, you head back to camp with Maru. He mashes the berries into a paste, adding a few herbs he gathered along the way. The result is a delicious, nutty, red pudding with whole berries mixed in for texture. You and your companions share the scrumptious dessert, delighting in its unique flavor as you relax in the camp.

You press forward through the second layer as your seach from the Empty-handed Broker, and as you do, the dewdrops from above accumulate, each one adding to the symphony of droplets cascading down from the treetops. The once gentle drizzle intensifies into a monsoon, pounding against the soil and leaves, filling the air with the deafening roar of water.

Through the deluge, you catch a glimpse of something unusual nestled in the tangled undergrowth. As you approach, the sinister visage of the Broker reveals itself. The alabaster statue stands before you, an eerie contrast to the vibrant, chaotic jungle surrounding it. The twisted horns and chipped robe give the figure a sense of ancient malevolence, as if the statue is an echo of a time long past.

You hesitantly reach out to touch the statue's hands, and a sudden wave of claustrophobia washes over you. The sensation is suffocating, as if the vines and thorns have closed in around you, leaving you with no escape. The feeling passes as quickly as it came, leaving you with a lingering sense of unease.

As the chilling rain continues to pour down around you, you realize the weight of the choice you have made. 

You have gained 100 corruption points, but you must always keep your corruptions points above 0 from now until the end of your journey.

:: Layer2 Star 1 [layer2]
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Wonders/fate-crossingstar.png']]

You push through the dense foliage, seeking the site of the pond, until the sight of rugged rocks breaks the monotony of green. As you approach, you find a hidden gem: the Fate-crossing Star's pond. The water is a glistening, crystalline blue, its surface disturbed only by the faintest of ripples. The scent of freshness, a welcome contrast to the cloying jungle air, fills your nostrils.

With cautious curiosity, you step into the water, which embraces your weary limbs like a soothing balm. It's comfortable, despite the foreign environment, but an inexplicable itch dances in the back of your mind. You can't help but feel that the pond hides a secret, waiting to be uncovered.

As you immerse yourself, the sounds of the jungle seem to fade, replaced by the gentle lapping of water against the rocks. Time loses meaning as you become one with the pond, allowing its cool embrace to envelop you entirely.

When morning comes, you find yourself waking to an entirely different reality. The familiar weight of your body is gone, replaced by a foreign, alien sensation. You open your eyes and realize that you have swapped bodies with one of your companions. You look into a puddle on the ground and stare in disbelief at your own face, now looking back at you with equal astonishment.

Whose body do you find yourself in?

	The moment the curse grips you, you feel an intense sensation. Your penis springs to full erection, and then continues to grow. The base, the shaft, and the tip swell larger than they've ever been before, until you're sporting a $app.penisCor inch long dong.

	As the erection gradually subsides, you find yourself shifting awkwardly, seeking a comfortable position to accommodate your member, which insists on staying at a larger size than you're used to. The feeling of your penis brushing against your thigh elicits a mix of emotions. It might be a curse, but it could also be a blessing.
<<elseif $app.penisCor==0 && $app.breastsCor>0>>
	The moment the curse grips you, you feel it. Your nipples jut out like pencil erasers as a pressure and a stretching sensation fills your breasts. Your boobs strain against your skin, plumper than they've ever been, and the skin expands to accommodate the swelling mass within.

	Flickering sensations and an instinctive gut feeling about the abyss' intentions assure you that this isn't just fat. Your milk ducts expand with your breasts, and the intricate network of functional and nervous tissues tingles as the swelling finally subsides. Glancing down at your new $app.breastsLabel cup breasts, the motion sends a subtle jiggle through them. You think some additional support might soon be necessary with these girls proudly jutting out of your chest.

	Your body buzzes with tension as the curse grips you. Your penis springs to full erection, and then just keeps growing. Simultaneously, your nipples jut out like pencil erasers as a pressure and a stretching sensation fills your breasts. The base, the shaft, and the tip of your penis continue swelling until you're sporting a $app.penisCor inch long dong. Your boobs strain against your skin, plumper than they've ever been, and the skin expands to accommodate the growing mass within.

	You can feel your milk ducts expanding with your breasts, and as the swelling finally subsides, you can look down at your new $app.breastsLabel cup breasts. As the moment passes and you start to become accustomed to your transformed body, you are certain that for a while you'll be distracted by the added mass swinging between your legs and the extra jiggle on your chest.

A shiver runs down your spine, but it doesn't stop at the bottom. The shiver continues towards an imaginary extension of your spine that moves outward from directly above your butt. You involuntarily squirm at first, due to the unfamiliar sensation, but after a few seconds you're able to accomodate it and accept it as just another physical sensation, like your body was adapting to the new sensory inputs.

An intense surge of arousal envelops you, only to gradually ebb away. Then, a weight nestles in the pit of your stomach, and an inescapable sense of fate grips you. The Abyss won't release you that easily. Once a month, an overpowering carnal craving will seize you, driving you to the brink of surrender.

As the realization dawns, you acknowledge the irresistible force of nature that you will become. The potent hormones coursing through your veins will shatter your self-control and obliterate your rationality. The things you'll crave - to fuck and to be fucked in every way imaginable - will be impossible to resist.

How does it feel to know what awaits you? Your quickened breaths betray your inner turmoil, revealing the truth about your deepest desires.

As you proceed, you notice a peculiar sensation washing over you. At first, it's barely perceptible, but gradually, it intensifies. Your limbs feel lighter, your steps more buoyant. You can't help but feel a growing sense of vulnerability, as if your body has become more susceptible to the substances around you.

As the Curse takes hold, your senses are further heightened. The scent of the damp earth becomes intoxicating, and the colors of the surrounding foliage appear more vivid and alluring. You realize that this Curse, Lightweight, has left you more sensitive to the effects of various substances. The thought is both exhilarating and terrifying.

You'll need to be particularly careful with alcohol, or any other similar substance, in the future.

Suddenly, an unexpected warmth washes through your abdomen, spreading outward in pulses. It's not painful, but it's not entirely pleasant either. You glance down, your eyes widening as you notice the changes. Your penis is retreating inwards, morphing, transforming. The sensation is bizarre, a strange hollow feeling enveloping you as you watch it disappear, only to be replaced by the soft, sensitive folds of a vagina.

Your hands instinctively move to explore this new part of you, a gasp escaping your lips as you feel the delicate tissues, the warmth, the moistness. It feels strange but not foreign, a part of you, a new and exciting sensation that sends shivers down your spine. The sensitivity is heightened, each brush of your fingers sending waves of unexpected pleasure through you.

Simultaneously, a pressure builds in your chest. Looking down, you see your flat pecs swelling, stretching, and forming into round $app.breastsLabel breasts. The size is proportionate to your previous endowment, each pulse of the Curse adding more to their fullness. Your fingers trace the curves, the sensation of the soft flesh and the erect nipples sending another jolt through your body. You're simultaneously awed and terrified by the sudden transformation.

As you stand in the dense undergrowth of the Abyss, vulnerable and transformed, you can't help but ponder on how these changes will affect your future. How will the others react? Will you be able to adjust to this new body, these new sensations?

A sense of trepidation and excitement fills you as you continue your journey, your transformation a testament to the unpredictable, chaotic magic of the Abyss. Though your physical self has changed, you remain determined. The Curse may have changed your body, but not your spirit. You are still you - just in a new form.
<<else>>\
Suddenly, a peculiar heat radiates from your lower body, alarming yet not painful. Your breath catches as you witness your breasts start to recede, leaving behind a flatter, more muscular chest. The disappearance of their weight feels strange, a loss of a familiar part of yourself that sends a pang of uncertainty through you.

Almost simultaneously, a bulge forms in your lower abdomen. It's a peculiar feeling, not unlike a muscle flexing and unflexing, but situated in a place where no muscle has existed before. As your vagina disappears, it is replaced by a growing appendage, a $app.penisCor inch penis, proportional to your previous breasts.

You tentatively touch this new part of your anatomy, taken aback by the firmness of it, the heat emanating from it. It's a foreign sensation but not an entirely unpleasant one. A simple brush of your hand sends a rush of unfamiliar pleasure coursing through you, a sensitivity you didn't anticipate.

As the reality of your transformation settles, your hands wander over your new form. The absence of your breasts is jarring, replaced by a flat, firm chest. The newly formed penis is an oddity you find yourself fascinated with, the changes making you feel both powerful and vulnerable at the same time.

What will this mean for your future in the Abyss? Will you be stronger, faster, more resilient? Or will this new form bring its own set of challenges? Will your comrades accept you, or will they view you with suspicion? It's a terrifying uncertainty, but you can't afford to let your fear hold you back.

Standing tall, you brace yourself for the journey ahead. The Abyss has changed you, but it has not defeated you. You're not quite the woman you once were, but inside, you're still the same fearless explorer. Your body may have changed, but your spirit remains unbroken, ready to face whatever the Abyss throws at you next.

In the midst of your journey through the second layer, a peculiar sensation seizes you; it starts as a dull ache in your lower belly and quickly escalates into a throbbing, almost unbearable pain. It's as if something within you is trying to escape, to burst forth into existence. Sweat pours down your face, dripping onto your chest.

Simultaneously, a pressure builds in your chest. Looking down, you see your flat pecs swelling, stretching, and forming into round $app.breastsLabel breasts. The size is proportionate to your endowment, each pulse of the Curse adding more to their fullness. Your fingers trace the curves, the sensation of the soft flesh and the erect nipples sending another jolt through your body. You're simultaneously awed and terrified by the sudden transformation.

Suddenly, the tension is released, and you are left panting, your body slick with sweat and rainwater. As you look down, your eyes widen at the sight. Your $app.penisCor inch penis is still present, but there's an addition. A soft, sensitive mound has formed just beneath it, the unmistakable shape of a vagina. It feels... new. Delicate. Responsive to every breeze, every drop of rain that hits it.

A strange mix of fear and excitement fills you as you consider the implications. The Curse has left you with a unique anatomy, one that could lead to all sorts of unusual experiences. Would this make your journey through the Abyss more dangerous or could it somehow be an advantage? As your hand instinctively reaches down, you wince at the foreign sensation, a paradox of familiarity and novelty.

You're a futa now, a combination of both sexes. With a sigh, you touch your breasts, the familiar curves now contrasting with the new addition. It's an odd mix, making you feel both powerful and vulnerable at the same time. It's a change, an alteration in the very core of your identity, and you're not sure whether to be terrified or intrigued.

Staring into the dense foliage, you try to gather your thoughts. Your life in the Abyss was already unpredictable, filled with dangers and challenges that tested your mettle at every turn. This new development, however, is an entirely different type of challenge. It changes how you perceive yourself, and possibly how the denizens of the Abyss will perceive you.

But you're a survivor. You've always been one. And if this new challenge is what the Abyss has thrown at you, then you'll face it head-on, with all the courage and resilience that's gotten you this far. The Abyss may be unpredictable, but so are you. And you're not about to let it forget that.
<<else>>\
In the midst of your journey through the second layer, suddenly, a sharp pain stabs through your lower belly, a feeling so intense that it causes you to stagger, clutching at a nearby vine for support. The pain intensifies, becoming a hot, searing sensation that makes you grit your teeth and squeeze your eyes shut.

The pain slowly subsides, leaving you panting and weak-kneed. When you dare to look down, your breath hitches in your throat. Below your $breastSize breasts, right where your vagina is, there's something new. A fleshy appendage, firm and sensitive to the touch. Your hand shakes as you reach down, a gasp escaping your lips as you confirm the reality. You've grown a penis, $penisSize inches in length.

A flurry of thoughts race through your mind. How will this affect your journey through the Abyss? Will it be a burden, or could it possibly offer some advantage? The feel of the new organ, heavy and foreign between your legs, is disorienting. The sensation of the rain falling on it, each drop causing a tingling response, is both confusing and curiously thrilling.

You're a futa now, a combination of both sexes. With a sigh, you touch your breasts, the familiar curves now contrasting with the new addition.

:: Take on Blushing Virgin [layer2]
<<set $playerCurses.push($curse24)>><<set $corruption += $curse24.corr>>\

Suddenly, a sharp, stabbing sensation pierces your chest. It feels as if your very soul is being invaded by an unseen force, and you instinctively clutch at your heart. Your mind races with thoughts of the unknown, the fear of the changes that the Curse may bring. A hazy, intoxicating fog fills your thoughts, and your knees buckle as the full weight of the Curse takes hold.

The Blushing Virgin Curse now flows through your veins, causing a profound shift in your psyche. Any aspect of your demeanor that was bold or unashamed seems to vanish, replaced by a deep and overwhelming sense of vulnerability. The idea of engaging in any sexual activities or even simple nudity makes your cheeks flush with embarrassment, your heart pounding like a wild animal caged within your chest.

As you continue your journey through the Abyss, you can't help but ponder how this Curse will affect your future interactions. Will the newfound embarrassment and shame hinder your relationships with others? Will your bashful nature prove to be a barrier to deeper connections or will it make them more meaningful and intimate?

Despite the anxiety and uncertainty that grips you, you press on, trying to focus on the task at hand - exploring the mysteries of the Abyss. Yet the Curse remains ever-present, a constant reminder of your altered state, the flush of your cheeks a testament to your newfound vulnerability.

[img[setup.ImagePath + $relic10.pic]]

After many hours of trudging through the second layer of the Abyss, you feel a change in the atmosphere. A notable quietness falls upon the dense thicket, only broken by the pitter-patter of water droplets falling from the canopy above. You pause, taking a moment to wipe the dampness from your forehead. As you straighten, your gaze falls on a vine-wrapped entrance to a cavern, nestled snugly in the base of an enormous tree. The cavern, made visible by a stray beam of light breaking through the thick foliage, promises a departure from the oppressive density of the jungle.

As you step into the cavern, you're met with an echoing silence, an unexpected sanctity inside the chaos of the Abyss. The ground under your boots is no longer the damp and knotted roots, but surprisingly, a smooth, granite-like surface. Strange luminescent fungi, unlike anything you've ever seen, clings to the walls and ceiling of the cavern, casting a soft, otherworldly glow.

Intriguingly, the cavern walls are covered in meticulous drawings and symbols, seeming to tell a story older than time. In the center of it all, standing on an intricate pedestal carved from the same granite-like material, you find a bucket filled with a mysterious, shimmering substance - the Firmament Pigment.

The paint in the bucket twinkles and dances, perfectly mimicking the night sky outside the Abyss. It seems to beckon you. As you lift the bucket, the celestial patterns within it shift and change, following your movements and the changes in the zenith above. As if in response to the Firmament Pigment's displacement, the luminous fungi flicker, creating an eerie, shimmering mirage around you.

Using a worn-out brush you find nearby, you dip it into the Firmament Pigment. The moment the bristles touch the liquid, they light up, becoming an extension of the night sky trapped within the bucket. Your heart races with anticipation as you take the brush to the granite wall of the cavern. A single stroke, and the wall comes alive. An animated display of the starry night unfolds right before your eyes, sparkling and shifting in accordance with the cosmos above.

Suddenly, the whole cavern is bathed in starlight, as if you've brought the heavens themselves into the second layer of the Abyss. A sense of accomplishment fills you. You’ve discovered and retrieved the Firmament Pigment, ready to bring a piece of the cosmos back to the surface.

The thorny path ahead of you is shadowed, sunlight filtering down through the thick overhead foliage in small, scattered patches. It seems as though the jungle pulsates with a rhythm of its own, a chorus of croaks, chirps, and distant growls setting a primeval symphony. The path narrows even further and the undergrowth gives way to a large, formidable tree, its bark weathered and gnarled with time. Puzzlingly, a natural archway is formed by the tree's roots, reminiscent of a gateway into another world.

As you approach the archway, you notice a peculiar characteristic: dewdrops, reflecting light like tiny prismatic gems, are dripping not from the dense foliage above, but from the gaping mouth of the tree arch. It's as though the tree is weeping, creating a cascading curtain of shimmering droplets. The dew converges at the base of the tree, creating a swirling, small-scale tempest that forms a barrier of sorts.

Just beyond the watery veil, a small pedestal of interwoven vines can be seen. Atop the pedestal lies an ordinary-looking toothbrush - a stark contrast to the ancient, mystical surroundings. The item seems so bizarrely mundane in such an exotic environment, yet there's a quiet air of majesty to it. You recognize it as the Pearly Gates.

Your heart rate quickens in excitement. This is the moment you've been preparing for. You brace yourself, extending a hand through the barrage of water. It's colder than you expect, tingling with a kind of vibrational energy that raises the hairs on your arm. You grip the toothbrush handle, its surface smooth and reassuring.

As your fingers curl around it, the water barrier subsides instantly, the downpour of dewdrops ceasing, as if the forest itself acknowledges your claim on the Relic. You pull back your hand, holding the Pearly Gates in your grasp. As it touches the dry air, you can smell the faint scent of mint wafting up to your nose. You give a sigh of relief - your teeth, and the teeth of many others, will thank you for your efforts.

Pulling away from the now silent tree gateway, you embark back on your journey, braving the thicket with a renewed sense of determination.

You traverse deeper into the dense labyrinth of the second layer of the Abyss. Your heart pounds, the rhythmic beat echoed by the symphony of raindrops cascading from the thicket above.

Slowly, your eyes adjust to the dim light filtered through the leaves overhead, allowing you to notice an unexpected clearing ahead. Upon reaching it, you see a massive stone statue of a muscular figure standing proudly at the center, completely dwarfing you. It holds a small metallic barbell in its stone hands, evoking an awe-inspiring sense of strength and resilience.

Curiosity drawing you closer, you circle the statue. The detailed veins on the arms, the abs carved with meticulous precision, and the proud expression on its face tell tales of hard work and diligence. Suddenly, your gaze is fixated on the metallic barbell it holds. It appears almost identical to the World Stone's description.

Carefully, you attempt to climb the statue. The slippery surface, wet from the constant drizzle, challenges your grip. After a few tries, you manage to haul yourself onto the statue's outstretched arm, wrapping your arms tightly around the cold stone bicep.

Reaching for the stone barbell, you manage to pry it from the statue's hand. The barbell feels oddly weightless. As you adjust your grip, you notice the weight increase, conforming to your capability and intention. This is it. This is the World Stone.

Heart pounding with triumph, you slide down from the statue, the Relic in your grasp. 

And as you retreat, winding back through the vine-riddled labyrinth, you can't help but appreciate the irony. In the middle of a forest, in the heart of the Abyss, you found not just a Relic of strength, but a testament to human perseverance. 

You can try working out with this Relic. It can both improve your muscle tone and your carrying capacity if you exercise regularly.

You descend deeper into the wild, verdant undergrowth of the second layer of the Abyss. Thick bramble of gnarled trunks and tangled vines are slick with the constant drizzle from above. Large eyes blink at you from within the darkness of the foliage, the Abyss's curious critters observing your progress with cautious intrigue.

In the distance, you spot a soft, golden light breaking through the emerald-green canopy, a stark contrast to the monotone ambience. Driven by curiosity, you navigate through the thorny bushes and stubborn vines, each obstacle serving only to heighten your resolve.

Eventually, you find yourself in a glade where the golden light is at its strongest. At the heart of the glade stands a majestic tree unlike any other you have seen in the Abyss. Its bark shimmers like silver and gold, its roots weaving intricate designs across the mossy earth. Yet, what truly grabs your attention is not the grandeur of the tree, but a small shrine nestled at its base.

As you draw closer, you recognize the shrine as a carving made from the tree's own roots. Embedded in the network of silver and golden roots is the Forest's Gift, shimmering with a light matching that of the tree. A simple necklace, yet an artifact of profound implications.

With your eyes set firmly on the necklace, you reach out to claim the Forest's Gift. The moment your fingers brush the Relic, a deep, ominous growl reverberates through the glade. A shadowy figure emerges from behind the towering tree, a massive beast shrouded in vines and fur.

The beast stands between you and your exit, its intense gaze a clear testament to its protective nature over the Relic. The moment of calm that prevailed just seconds ago is shattered, replaced with an air of palpable tension.

However, you recall the powers of the Forest's Gift, its ability to communicate with animals. It's a gamble, but the necklace might be your only way out of this confrontation. You channel your thoughts towards the beast, projecting feelings of peace, understanding, and camaraderie.

The beast seems to pause, its eyes softening ever so slightly. Slowly, it steps aside, allowing you to pass, but never once breaking its gaze. It is clear that this was a test, a measure of your worthiness to bear the Relic. With a final nod to the creature, you pass, the golden light of the glade fading into the backdrop as you continue your journey.

As you cautiously tread through the eerie, dense foliage, the ambient sounds of this enchanted forest echo around you, an orchestra of nature humming a haunting symphony. This second layer of the Abyss, though treacherous, is full of life. The rhythmic dripping of dew from the flora overhead enhances the ambiance, merging with the symphony of the Abyss to create an unusual melody.

Suddenly, a soft, ethereal glow emanates from a hidden path on your right. It stands in stark contrast with the dense, intimidating surroundings of the Abyss, urging you to explore. As you move closer, the glow brightens, and a distinct tune starts to waft through the dense foliage. It is delicate yet insistent, and it resonates with an unknown genre, a blend of adventure and anticipation.

You push past thick layers of vines and step into the clearing from where the music originates. The space is surprisingly open, a grand canopy of intertwined branches overhead creating a natural dome. In the heart of the clearing, levitating above a pedestal of intertwining tree roots, is the source of both the light and the music – the Harmless Harmony.

The harp looks otherworldly. Concentrated beams of light replace the strings, radiating a calming glow that illuminates the clearing. Each beam seems to vibrate independently, producing the enchanting melody that flows into your ears, a song of exploration and courage.

Cautiously, you approach the Relic. As you draw closer, the music subtly shifts. The notes become more pronounced, resonating with an adventurous tune that mimics the echoing heartbeats of a brave explorer. You can't help but feel a sense of excitement that matches the music’s pace. It feels as though this is your theme song, the soundtrack of your daring venture into the Abyss.

Mustering your courage, you extend your hand, your fingertips tingling as they pass through the beams of light. You can feel a distinct vibration, a mild tingle as your touch strums the Harmless Harmony. The Relic responds in kind, playing a crescendo, matching the rhythm of your heart.

As you lift the harp, the music swells, filling the clearing with a triumphant melody. You can feel it resonating in your soul, a sense of achievement sweeping over you.

With the Relic in your possession, you turn back to the dense path you've just cleared. The music adjusts again, now playing a calm and soothing tune, a balm to your tired body, matching the rhythmic patter of dewdrops around you.

Your eyes catch something peculiar ahead; a pocket of unnatural darkness amidst the verdant chaos, a stark contrast to the vibrant hues of the thicket. An unassuming, shadowy cavern lays tucked away, concealed within a gnarled tree's enormous roots.

The walls of the cavern are irregular and jagged, not carved by hands, but formed through countless years of elemental erosion. A profound chill fills the air, and as you venture further, you notice the darkness growing more palpable, a palpable void that no natural light seems to pierce.

You remember the description of the Umbra Trident, a small golden fork with a unique property - it interacts with shadows. Your instinct tells you that this pitch-black cavern must be its resting place, the perfect location that aligns with its cryptic nature.

The only problem? It's impossible to retrieve the Relic in complete darkness.

From the depth of your backpack, you pull out a sturdy flashlight, clicking its button. The beam of light pierces the cavern's darkness, casting sharp, shifting shadows against the cave's craggy walls. The cave begrudgingly accepts your intrusion, the artificial light illuminating its secrets.

You step further in, the flashlight held high. And there it is. On a naturally formed stone pedestal, the tiny golden fork rests, its form barely visible, a mere silhouette against the stubborn darkness.

As you reach out, the shadow cast by the fork reacts, a dark tendril reaching out as if in defense. The real fork remains undisturbed, but its shadow dances and sways, moving away from your hand as if trying to escape. It can't be moved in the dark, not without light to control its shadow.

You maneuver the flashlight strategically, manipulating the beam to corral the shadow. Step by step, with careful precision, you guide the shadow of the Trident towards the real golden fork. The two align, and you swiftly reach out, clutching the small Relic in your hand.

The Umbra Trident - a golden fork, deceptively simple, and yet, brimming with uncanny power. A chill runs up your spine as you realize that the darkness in the cavern seems just a bit less oppressive now that the Relic is yours.

All around you is the incessant dripping of water from the verdant canopy above, the droplets refracting the faint light that filters down from the upper layer. The gentle drizzle slowly intensifies, culminating in a downpour akin to a monsoon shower.

Your destination? The hiding place of the Event Horizon, a Relic known to provide a solution to the unique inconveniences of sustained exploration. As you venture further into this enormous, thriving layer, you notice a subtle change in your surroundings.

The tangle of foliage gradually thins out, replaced by large, stony structures overgrown with moss and lichen, a stark contrast against the verdant surroundings. They are massive stone fingers reaching up towards the canopy, as if grasping for the sunlight that barely penetrates this deep. Here, amongst these primal monoliths, you find what you are looking for.

At the base of one of these stone structures, half submerged in a pool of luminous water, you spot a gleam. It is the Event Horizon, the bracelet. It is lodged within a small, hollow recess, guarded by a cluster of rare, color-shifting orchids, their petals changing color in time with the heartbeat-like rhythm of the falling droplets.

You reach out tentatively, drawing your hand back as a rush of vapor hisses out from the recess. A smell of ozone and ancient stone fills the air, an electric sensation prickling your skin. You recognize this as a defensive measure, a remnant of ancient, arcane technology.

Mustering your courage, you push your hand through the stinging vapor. The Relic hums against your skin, and for a moment, you feel as though you are standing on the precipice of a black hole, all existence swirling into a vortex before you. The sensation fades as quickly as it comes, replaced by a reassuring warmth. You slip the bracelet onto your wrist, and it instantly conforms to your size, snug but not restrictive.

As you withdraw your hand, the vapor subsides, and the orchids return to their rhythmic dance, unperturbed. The Relic secured, you continue your descent into the Abyss, your journey made significantly easier with the Event Horizon at your disposal.

The air is thick with the moisture from the never-ending rain of dewdrops, the foliage overhead a vibrant, pulsing canopy of green that blots out any sign of the layer above. The ground underfoot is uneven, pitted with hidden roots and strewn with fallen leaves. With every step, you can feel the mulch yield beneath your weight, a constant reminder of the life that thrives, unseen, under your feet.

Suddenly, a series of flickering lights catch your eye, drawing you towards them. Pushing through a curtain of drooping vines, you emerge into a small clearing filled with thousands of luminescent fireflies. They dart around you, bathing the clearing in a kaleidoscopic glow, and you feel a gentle breeze caress your face, a curious anomaly in the otherwise stagnant area.

There, at the center of the clearing, you see it – the Heart-stealing Stole. It's draped over a stone plinth, the edges gently stirring in the breeze, shimmering with an allure that belies the oppressive weight of the Abyss around it. The Stole seems almost out of place amidst the dense greenery and the wild pulse of life.

Carefully, you approach the plinth. The fireflies seem to react to your presence, their lights pulsating rhythmically, casting dancing shadows on the stone surface. Your hands, trembling with anticipation and caution, reach for the Stole. The fabric feels incredibly light against your fingers, silky to the touch, as if it's spun from the very wind that blows through this bizarre oasis.

You lift the Stole, drawing it from the plinth, and a sudden gust of wind sweeps through the clearing. The fireflies swarm around you, creating a vortex of light, and for a moment, you feel as if you've become the eye of a storm. The Stole flutters around you, its movements almost sentient, coiling around your neck with a fluid grace.

The moment the fabric settles against your skin, you feel an immediate change. The noise of the jungle around you seems to fade away. The weight of the Abyss feels somehow lighter, its oppressive force diminished. The fireflies’ glow grows brighter, their lights painting you in an otherworldly light, an echo of the allure that the Stole promises.

With the Heart-stealing Stole around your neck, you feel like the center of attention in this little corner of the Abyss, an adventurer surrounded by an audience of fireflies, the forest waiting for your next move with bated breath. A fresh wave of resolve washes over you, and you turn to face the dense underbrush, ready to press on.

You may want to start wearing this Relic regularly, it can significantly speed up how long it takes your companions to become more affectionate with you.

You arrive at a peculiar section of the second layer. A great archway of entwined ivy branches marks the entrance, beyond which the vegetation is an even denser, almost impenetrable maze. The undergrowth here is not just dense; it appears unnaturally slick, as if coated in a thick sheen of oil. The typically verdant plant-life glows an iridescent purple, evoking the lilac hue associated with the Effacing Asperity.

The journey through this slippery labyrinth becomes progressively more challenging as you constantly slip and slide, barely maintaining your balance. The realization hits you - this is the dwelling place of the Effacing Asperity. The vegetation here has been imbued with the relic's power, resulting in drastically reduced friction.

The undergrowth eventually opens into a circular clearing, an oasis of serenity amidst the chaos of the Abyss. At its center, lying on a bed of soft moss, is an aerosol can. Its metal surface glows with the same iridescent purple as the slick vines around you, standing as a stark contrast to the evergreen surroundings.

With a mix of awe and anticipation, you reach out and take hold of the Relic. It's unexpectedly cold to the touch, but it thrums with a sense of dormant power that resonates with your hand, almost as if it's alive. You give it a little shake, hearing the faint sound of its liquid contents. A smirk plays on your lips as you press the top, releasing a puff of lilac mist that instantly clears, leaving an almost imperceptible film over the moss underneath, rendering it incredibly slick to the touch, as if all friction had been removed.

As you navigate through the labyrinthine tangle of dense vegetation, the damp dewdrop drizzle that had been your constant companion begins to wane. A hush falls over the Abyss, as if you've entered a sanctum untouched by time. The dense foliage yields to a clearing; an expansive grotto within the heart of the thicket. Sunlight seeping through the canopy above reveals a verdant oasis; the air around you hums with a palpable serenity, untouched by the relentless clamor of the jungle.

In the center of the grotto stands a table carved from a massive boulder, its surface smoothed to perfection by the hands of an unseen artisan. A simple basin, rough-hewn yet elegant, rests upon it, brimming with clear rainwater.

As you approach, the grandeur of the scene dawns upon you. The dappled sunlight reflecting off the water in the basin creates a mosaic of dancing lights across the stone table, enhancing the already otherworldly ambiance. The attention to detail, the exquisite craftsmanship, it is as if the scene was specifically arranged for a Relic as extraordinary as the Wholly Ale.

Your heart skips a beat as you spot the chalice on the far side of the table. The Wholly Ale. It's smaller than you imagined, an unassuming thing. However, the simple grace of its design, the modest curves of its cup, and the delicate etching along its side speak of an unmatched craftsmanship. Despite its size, it exudes an aura of majesty that seems to command the space around it.

Gently, almost reverently, you pick up the chalice. It's lighter than you'd anticipated, yet it feels solid and substantial in your hands. You pour some of the rainwater from the basin into the chalice. In the clear vessel, the liquid takes on a shimmering quality, like liquid moonlight.

With a slight chuckle, you will the water to transform into the rich, dark ale you recall seeing seeing at a tavern once in the past. The water in the chalice changes almost instantly. The scent of hops and barley wafts up from the vessel, igniting a fond nostalgia within you.

This grotto, an oasis within the tumultuous Abyss, feels more like a shrine; a sacred space hallowed by the presence of the Relic. You pause for a moment to savor the peace before you continue your journey.

You started so full of hope, dreams and energy, you thought with enough determination and time you would make it to the deepest part of the Abyss ... and now look at you, your spirit is broken, your money gone and your dreams dashed. And so you find yourself back in the second layer, the heavy rain hammering on you as to remind you of your failure. The only good thing that happened to you on this good forsaken journey is that you became strong or maybe you should call it cunning or perhapse experienced, it doesn't matter anyways. What counts is getting results and your Abyss experienced learned you how to get results, that's stremgth in itself. And you are going to use this strength to your advantage like you should have done from the start. The most important lessons that you learned are 1. Kill or be killed 2. take what you need and then a little more and 3. No regrets no mercy. The Abyss is cold and uncaring and you adapted quickly to it. So you start the rest of your life. Soon everyone knows and fears you. You are feard as one of the best mercenary or assasins, not only on the second layer but also on the first and even the surface.  Your off days are spent drinking to forget, but it never wörks for long since the nightmares are just a drink too much and a drink too few away, always lurking in the back of your head.

After a long time wandering in the Abyss you are tired.
You have seen wonders and horrors alike and survived till now.
But you had to pay a heavy price. most of your autonomy is gone. You look down on yourself and see once again your childish body as the heavy rain of the second layer purs down on you.
But not everything is hopeless. On your grueling travels through the abys you made quite the fortune, making you one of the richest persons around.
But you still have the body and with that, the strength of a child, that and sporadic acts of childishness are problems you cannot overcome alone.
So you seek out the help of somebody strong who can protect you, and you find Dimitry who is willing to help you out in exchange for your coin. Dimitry lives in a slightly bigger house than common and is one of the nicest and strongest people in the second layer. It was a gamble to go to him for help but of all the people he was well known for having a soft spot for children as well as being honorable.
Soon you and Dimitry are growing closer and what began as a business deal has started to feel like a real family.
He protects you from the more unsavory people of the second layer and even trains you to hunt and fight better than before your glory days. He supports you when you wake up in the night plagued by nightmares from your old diving days. He listens to your tales about the wonders that you have seen and laughs and jokes with you. Once you are old enough again you start to hunt to support Demitry since the money you had was long spent and once your fully grown you plan to start delving again this time to support your new family.

You don't know when it happened bur you remember you where in Downcast village when it happened. You just broke down. The Abyss had stripped you of most of you maturity and at the benefit of what? You don't know if this childlike body was finally influencing your mental state or if it was the burden of constant struggle in general, but you broke down and you broke down hard. You cried so hard that even with constant rain of the second layer it was still clear that tears were flowing freely from your eyes. At some point a man stopped in front of you and asked what the matter was, half brawling and half stuttering you explained the whole story. He listens attentively, while you pour your heart out. At some point you calmed down and he speaks up for the first time in a while. ‘So you don't have a lot of coin on you? Hmm there might be not much I can do than…' He falls quiet for a while. ‘Look kid, there is something like a kids day care just ahead. In this town we have a lot of, let's call them ‘unplanned kids' being born. Maybe they can help you out as well, that's all I offer'. You head towards the prescribed location and find an elderly lady with two younger aids looking over a bunch of kids, some even younger than you are. When you offer your last earnings for some food and shelter they look at each other but accept your offer anyway. They next few days you are looked after by them, although you get the feeling you are still being kept away from most of the kids, maybe its because they suspect you aren't a normal kid or maybe it's because they don't want trouble with the parents of the kids who get pick-up at the end of the day. But all in all you are happy that you at least have some place to stay. You even see the man that gave you the lifesaving tip a couple of times walking by, as you wave happily to him. After a while though the old lady approaches you with the bad news that they have to put you out on the street again as they can't support you without financial backing. You find yourself one the street once more, but within an hour the same man from before is in front of you again. ‘What happened?' He grunts. 'They kicked me out because I had no money anymore' you snicker. ‘How can they…?! Urgh I'll have a word with them..' and he walks off. He is back within a mere moments and he just waves you over. You don't know how he did but you were allowed back. Things changed a little after that. The man, which you learned is called Dimitry started to actually visit you and would ask how they were treating you. While you didn't care at first that you weren't allowed to play with the other kids, you still felt somewhat adult after all, you started feeling left out and complained about it to Dimitry. That was the last time you played by yourself. As years went by Dimitry suddenly said you were going home with him that night. ‘Look kid, I just like it better when I can keep an eye on you. Besides I can teach you some fighting and hunting'. You still kept going to the day care during most days as Dimitry had to, in his word, ‘make sure you and I keep a roof over our heads' but you spend more and more time with him. As you aged again and you become more proficient in the skills Dimitry learned you, you were more determined to ever to use them to pay him back. Pay him back for what you know he did for you, but also for what you suspected you didn't know he did for you.

It's dark and cold in the cave you use as a refuge.
You had an interesting time in the Abyss. You saw amazing wonders and horrifying nightmares. But you paid a steep price for your adventure, you are unrecognizable as the one who started this journey, and your monstrous appearance scares even the strongest mercenary on the second layer. So you run to this cave just outside Downcast village where you now live.
Suddenly you hear a soft voice " Are you the beast that understands the human language? or better known as the transformed adventurer?."
"how do you know me?" you ask. "My employe knows a lot." the voice answers still not showing itself. "If you have enough of this cave come to this address." And then the voice is gone, outside you find a piece of paper. Sometime later you sit before a smiling man. He is not quite fat but still a bit plump and has a long mustache. "Nice to meet you my name is mister Gerard Reed and I want to hire you as my personal bodyguard"."... Why?" is all you can muster after your initial reception surprise. "Because you look like a monster... and have to be quite strong if the Abyss blessing has progressed this far, so what do you say? You don't have to do a lot just look menacing and help with the ... business a bit. In exchange, you will have a roof over your head and food on the table ... I think thats better than a cave don't you agree?". Well, what options do you have really, So you work for Mister G. Reed and become one of his most valued ... employes sowing fear and panic in the hearts of any who would oppose him.

They say money and power corrupt people, but they never delved into the Abyss.
No. the Abyss corrupts people and the money and power help you to cope with that, so it's only natural that you need more money.
After going around Downcast village looking to simply buy people to sate your sexual urges you suddenly find yourself in the office of mister Gerard Reed. "So word on the street is that you trying to buy people. Now tell me are you a rich addict or an over enthousiastic investor." He leans back in his big leather office chair. "A bit of both I guess," you stammer, already feeling the heat rising in your body again. "And I was hoping you could help, you see I have a specific idea..." You continue with some more determination. "Why do you think I would be interested in this idea of yours? I mainly wanted to meet you because you were kicking up dust. I don't like people kicking up dust in my little village," he says with a bit of an agitated tone. "I suggest you you use all that money you apparently have to enjoy your retirement, diver." You scrape your throat, feeling a bit desperate. "Well, I do have enough to get me started but my funds will run out rather quickly and the idea I had in mind is uh... how should I call it. It needs someone who can deal with delicate matters."
"Elaborate," Mr. Reed says with a light sparkle in his eyes and you know you have his full attention.
"Have you ever heard of the nymphs of the third layer?" "They are a myth," he says dismissively. "Not at all - I've seen them myself, all I need from you is to help me fund an expedition down to the third layer; then we capture them, sell some of them to rich assholes up on the surface... and with the rest, we can open a high-class brothel never seen on either layer or the surface. Which will make us richer and bring tourism down to this layer." "What about collateral should your expedition fail?" He says with a dark expression. "You can have all my cash," you say seriously. You actually don't care about the money anyway, or the potential revenue your business idea can generate. Ever since you got those Curses you have had an almost uncontrollable craving for sex and it seems to just get worse. Strangely enough the wealth of money you acquired has only made you pickier. A cheap whore just doesn't do it for you anymore, you need something exclusive and exotic. That's why this expedition must succeed.
After three grueling days where you have to take what you can to quench your... thirst, the expedition finally returns. You hired the best of the best, they were expensive but it was worth it and they return with six new Nymph slaves. Finally, you have something worthy on hand to quench your lust. Their beauty is beyond comparison and to you they look like living liquid gems.
After selling one to some dude on the surface you open the brothel with Mister Reed.
"Well, what did I tell you?" You ask with a grin after your first session.
"They sure are easy on the eyes and they have a lot of business potential," he says with a wicked grin on his face. You can hardly hide your own excitement. "Have you already sampled one?" Reed looks over to you with a predatory smile and a greedy glimmer in his eyes. "No, I haven't and I think I'll leave it to paying customers to sample them. More importantly, when are you planning to start the next expedition?" "Well since they are going to make us a lot of money," you say while janking on one of the leashes around the necks of the slaves, "I think we can start our next one in 2 months. Maybe we can send them down to the fourth layer this time, the Abyss is like a garden. We just have to pluck the ripest fruits and sell them so we can continue to harvest, hahaha."
After that exchange, you return to your new slave/toy for another round of *well-deserved* stress release. Soon your brothel becomes the biggest and best visited one in all of the Abyss. You have something for every taste: Nymphs, Nomads, but also normal humans. Your hunters also managed to get Lizard girls, dog and catgirls, most of which used to be divers, and one even got two succubi after a hard and dangerous visit to the 5th layer. Now you are one of the richest people, maybe second only to Mr Reed, in the Abyss. you have your own harem of beautiful 'toys' who do anything your sick and deranged heart demands. Talk of you and your brothel even reaches the surface and while you might be reviled there, from time to time people come down and admit they are actually pretty jealous of you. Yes, you can really be proud of yourself you think while sampling the newest product for your customers. You are such a hard worker.

As you bring the charm up to your eye and gaze deep into the red crystal, your vision fades and a new image comes clearly into view:

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Layer Intros/l2intro.png']]

@@.layerTitle;LAYER 2 - DEWDROP RAIN UNDERBRUSH@@

You see yourself standing under the cover of a dense rainforest, with great trees covering your view and continuous rain pouring down through the layers of branches and vines. Suddenly the image shifts and you see the splendor of the Relics that are available on this layer.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 3-relics.png']]

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 3-wonders.png']]

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and Curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 3-curses.png']]

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threaths that await you on the layer

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 3-threats.png']]

Finally, the vision fades, leaving you standing once again where you were before, with only a brief sense of motion sickness as you orient yourself back to your physical body. As you look at the Gleam Dazer once again, you notice the Relic is cracked and broken.

You stand on the cupboard directly over the two man, a small camera Relic in hand waiting for the perfect moment.
"Are you sure mister Reed won't find out about this?" "He is very... unkind to traitors and what you are planning is..." "He won't find out, the plan is as safe as safe can be, and afterward we'll be richer than he could ever imagine." The two men leave after checking the windows and locking the door and you start your job. You jump down from the cupboard without hurting yourself thanks to your slime-like body and look for the plans on the desk. Once you found them you use your camera to photograph them and crawl back up to the cupboard, once again using your slime-like properties. Smiling to yourself you leave through a mousehole. At first, you were devastated by your new body; you tried your best to continue your journey with your small and slimy body but in the end, you had to give up. Stranded on the second layer you cursed your fate. You survived the first month by stealing. You ended up getting crushed and squished more times than you can count but always bounced back once everyone left thanks to your slimy body. After a while, mister Reed approached you with an offer to work as a spy for him. Mister Reed is one of the most dangerous people in the upper layers of the Abyss: He has connections reaching all the way up to the surface and some rumors say even down on the fourth layer.
After a while you finally make it back to your boss. "Gerard, I finally got them," you say presenting him the camera. After working for him for many years now you are on a first-name basis with him. "Oh just what I was expecting. I take it you have undeniable proof?" "Of course, who do you think I am, some amateur? They were cunning though, it took weeks to find their headquarters."
"Well you did well. As always, I might add. You should take a break before heading out again," he says.  "I would really like to get my hands on whatever they were try to steal in the end," you muse.
"And I need to prepare a fitting punishment for them... Did they really think they could get away with trying to pin the blame on me for whatever they were after? Fools..." You just shrug your shoulders and leave. What happens next is none of your business, as long as you get paid you are happy. In the end you started to understand why some people call Curses a blessing.

	As you carefully navigate through the dense foliage of the second layer, the air is thick with humidity, and the damp, earthy scent of the jungle permeates your senses. The sound of water droplets falling from the intertwining vines above and splattering onto the ground creates a soft, rhythmic backdrop to your journey. With every step, the lush undergrowth brushes against your legs, the wet leaves leaving a trail of moisture on your skin.

	Suddenly, the air is filled with a low, guttural growl, echoing through the thicket, and you feel a shiver of anticipation run down your spine. The Baying Gourmet emerges from the shadows, its powerful legs and muscular body rippling with every movement. It sniffs the air, its flaring nostrils detecting the scent of your food rations. The beast's eyes lock onto yours, a primal hunger gleaming within them that makes your heart race.

A group of Baying Gourmets, creatures known for their prowess and strength, emerge from the shadows, their sinewy legs and muscular bodies undulating with every graceful stride. They sniff the air, their flaring nostrils detecting the enticing aroma of your food rations. The beasts' eyes meet yours, a primal hunger gleaming within them that makes your pulse quicken.

	A primal urge surges through you as you stand before the Baying Gourmet, and you decide to surrender to its animalistic desires. As the beast nears, its rough tongue licks your exposed skin, sending a wave of goosebumps and shivers coursing through your body. The sensation is both frightening and exhilarating, and your heart races with a mixture of fear and arousal.

	The creature's strong paws grip your body, the rough pads pressing against your flesh with a firm, yet surprisingly gentle touch. The Baying Gourmet's powerful, musky scent fills your nostrils as it begins to explore your body with its nose, mouth, and tongue.

	The beast's rough, warm tongue grazes over your sensitive areas, each stroke sending jolts of pleasure through your body. Its teeth nibble and bite, leaving marks that will remain for days, a reminder of your wild encounter. You find yourself giving in to the beast's primal passion, your body responding with a hunger that matches its own.

	As the Baying Gourmet continues to ravage your body, you realize that despite the beast's animalistic nature, it seems to know precisely how to drive you to the brink of ecstasy. Your breath comes in ragged gasps, and your skin is slick with sweat and the creature's saliva.

	Eventually, the Baying Gourmet releases you, having had its fill of you. Your body aches and trembles from the passionate encounter, and a mild limp reminds you of the wild beast that had its way with you. But deep down, a part of you craves the primal passion of the encounter and the raw, unbridled pleasure you experienced in the arms of the Baying Gourmet.
