Thanks to the effects of the Shifting Obelisk, your ideal prince will always come to your rescue. They never stick around for long before going off to "rescue other damsels", but they unfailingly return whenever you're in serious distress. They are the most ideal hero you can imagine to come to your aid (this also extends to their gender. "Prince" doesn't mean they have to be a man, or if they are that they must have a penis). Whenever you ask about their past or what they do when they're not with you, you get an answer that's slightly different and incompatible with the one you got last time you asked, but they always seem perfectly honest.`;

A rapid journey that can be a whirlwind of emotions and physical changes. It's a wild ride that requires the bearer to adapt quickly. You can only take this Curse if you have a womb.`;

You can also gain insights about the fetus's development and health during the rapid gestation period. The birthing process becomes safer and relatively painless.`;
