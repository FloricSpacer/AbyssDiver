!Layer 5 - Windswept Potpouri Sands
@@As you descend through the huge vertical shaft, the walls lining it slowly begin to become smoother, warmer, and drier. Before long, it transitions completely from a wall of ice into a wall of sandstone. As the shaft begins to open up horizontally into the fifth layer proper, the wind, previously gentle and cold, begins to roar beneath you, whipping up the vast expanse of sand in this layer into near-perpetual sandstorms. But sand isn't the only thing being scattered about by the wind.

For an area that otherwise bears such a strong resemblance to a surface desert, this layer is positively brimming with beautiful, colorful foliage, the petals of which chaotically dance in the wind, painting a shower of color against the backdrop of he ever-shifting dunes, and filling your nose with the scents of the world's best-stocked flower shop. Even the living flowers are astonishingly dry and fragrant, having long abandoned water and instead adapted to survive entirely on Miasma. Dotted about the layer, ruins carved from sandstone hide ancient secrets, telling the story of a long-gone civilization in a long-dead language.

Their bodies intertwine in a delicate dance, the man's muscular arms wrapped firmly around the woman's slender waist as she arches her back, her supple legs wrapped around his hips. Their faces, worn by time, betray a mixture of pain and ecstasy.

Every Relic in this layer is found in one of the many ruins that are carved into the landscape, and in keeping with the architectural theme seen throughout this layer, they're all guarded by complex and dangerous traps. Whoever built these traps was certainly clever about them &mdash; you'll run into tripwire right where you'd normally expect a pressure plate, question why these ancient-looking ruins appear to have some kind of laser-light sensors, and sometimes see traps seemingly activate on their own with no action on your part. In any case, avoiding them altogether just by being careful isn't practical, and you'll see one <b><i>every time</i> you try to take a Relic</b> from this layer.

Returning to layer four and passing through the long dividing area will take a very long time without a rope.

:: Layer5 Exit1 [layer5]
Layer 5 is the last layer that anyone on the surface currently has any reliable knowledge of. Reports of what lies further below often contain vague strange, and contradictory information, and few emerging from dives that venture lower are in a state to be reporting information to begin with. This means that sources like the Encyclopedia Abyssia are unlikely to be helpful from here on. If you understand this, and still wish to descend further to depths beyond humanity's current understanding, the trip will take 13 days.

			Fortunately, the scorpions in the pit are ordinary, untainted by the Abyss. Your Relic, the Forest's Gift, allows you to speak with and befriend the scorpions, quelling their initial hostility. Engaging in a brief, apologetic exchange, the scorpions direct you to a safe exit, ensuring you can escape the pit unharmed.

:: Take on Flower Power [layer5]
<<set $playerCurses.push($curse65)>><<set $corruption += $curse65.corr>>\
[img[setup.ImagePath + $curse65.pic]]

A sudden silence falls around you, drowning out the howling wind and the sandy cyclones swirling about the vast desert of the Abyss. You squint, feeling an alien sensation prickling along your skin, the hot sand against your boots suddenly replaced by the cooling touch of dew-laden petals. Looking down, you find the ground at your feet bursting with life, vibrant flowers of all shapes and sizes swaying back and forth, seeming to rise from the sand itself.

Suddenly, a searing sensation spikes through your body, grounding you to the spot. It isn't painful per se, but rather an overwhelming sensation of… growth, as if each cell in your body has been infused with the exuberant energy of spring. Your muscles tense and relax in quick succession, the frantic pulse echoing the racing beat of your heart.

You can feel your clothes tightening around you as if they're being pushed outward, and you pull at the fabric, freeing yourself from the now suffocating confines. As you expose your skin, you see thin, green vines curling out, the pale flesh beneath replaced with the exquisite texture of botanical artwork. These vines spiral around your limbs, encasing you in a sensual armor of flora.

Flowers start to bloom where your skin once was, their vibrant petals unfolding in a mesmerizing display of colors. There's the blushing pink of roses, the regal violet of irises, the sunny yellow of daffodils. Each flower pulsates with your heartbeat, a visible manifestation of your vitality. They are part of you, yet they possess a life of their own, shifting and shuddering under your curious touch.

You reach up, trailing your fingers over your scalp, expecting the soft brush of your hair. Instead, what greets your touch are leaves and flower petals - delicate, lush, and so very alive. A mirror image of the world around you, your new hair is a cascade of leaves, varying in shades of green, interspersed with brilliant blooms.

The transformation is a sensory explosion, not merely the sight and touch but even the smell. The fragrance is intoxicating, a heady bouquet of the most delightful floral scents. You inhale deeply, your senses tingling with the pleasure of this olfactory delight, the sweet perfumes lingering in your nostrils, making you feel light-headed.

You stand amidst the whirlwind of petals in the Abyss, a unique entity amongst the vast emptiness, a monument to life and vibrancy. But with this novel form, how will your life unfold from here? How will you traverse the dangers of the Abyss now that your form is not entirely your own?

The uncertainty breeds anticipation, a thrilling undercurrent that runs through your blooming body. The world, you realize, has morphed into an entirely new playground for you to explore, to mold, to challenge. Your newfound connection to the flora around you offers a whole new world of possibilities.

You lift your vine-laden arms, looking at your transformed body in the harsh light of the Abyss. The flowers and vines adorning you, while initially a shock, now bring an unexpected sense of power, an intimate link to the life that persists even in this harsh wasteland.

<<set $playerCurses.push($curse66)>><<set $corruption += $curse66.corr>>\
[img[setup.ImagePath + $curse66.pic]]

The wind whistled ominously, carrying a bouquet of floral scents that seemed too delicate for the harsh environment of the Abyss. Each gust felt like a lover's caress, a soft touch that set your skin aflame with goosebumps. The sand beneath your feet felt warm, a comforting solidity against the endless expanse of empty space beneath. The shimmering dunes stretched out in every direction, a sea of gold against a cerulean abyssal sky.

Then, a sharp, prickling sensation danced across your skin. It started as a faint itch on your wrist, a bothersome tickle that demanded attention. You looked down and saw a spark of brilliant light surrounding you. This was not a new phenomenon for you, you've experienced similar sensations when encountering a new curse, but never in such an intense and intimate manner. The light engulfed you, warming your skin, and for a moment, you were blinded by its intensity.

When your vision cleared, a strange feeling of stiffness washed over your body, creeping along your skin like a slow-moving wave. The softness of your skin seemed to be replaced by a smooth, firm surface. It was different, yet it held a peculiar allure. Your fingers traced over your arm, an exploratory caress that held equal parts curiosity and fascination. Your skin felt like the bark of a young tree, smooth, sturdy, and... plant-like.

The curse had transformed your skin into something akin to plant matter. It was a peculiar sensation, being bound to the plant life in such a personal, intimate manner. It filled you with a strange desire, a yearning to be close to nature, to embrace it.

You found your gaze drifting towards the vibrant foliage dancing in the sandstorm. Your new skin seemed to pulse in time with the wind-swept petals, as if resonating with their rhythmic dance. You closed your eyes, and for a moment, you were lost in the music of the desert. You felt a part of the desert, a part of the storm, a part of the blossoms that colored the air.

The wind blew stronger, and you could almost feel your skin drinking in the Miasma. It was like feeding on a lover's touch, an intoxication that left you breathless.

Your skin may be susceptible to flames now, but you found yourself not fearing the change. Instead, you were filled with a sense of... liberation. Your body had always been a vessel, a tool for your exploration. Now, it felt like a part of the environment, a piece of the Abyss itself.

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threaths that await you on the layer

As you continue your journey through the fifth layer of the Abyss, the perpetual sandstorms whip around you, creating a cacophony of sound that threatens to drown out your thoughts. The swirling sands mix with the vivid hues of the flower petals, creating a kaleidoscope of colors that is both mesmerizing and disorienting. The heavy, fragrant scents of the dry, Miasma-fed flowers fill your nostrils, leaving you feeling simultaneously invigorated and overwhelmed.
<br><br>
Suddenly, you feel a deep rumble beneath your feet. The ground trembles, and the once-distant roar of the wind is replaced by an even more ominous and guttural growl. Your heart races, as you realize the source of the sound: a Dune Devouring Borer.

The colossal creature bursts forth from the sands, its monstrous maw opening wide as it rears up to face you. You find yourself captivated by the sight of its powerful, armored body, the brown and bone-colored plates reflecting the storm of colors that surround it. The Borer's jaw snaps shut, producing a sound akin to the clash of titanic blades, sending a shudder down your spine.

Your instincts scream at you to run, but you know that simply running is futile against this relentless predator. Your only options are to give up your precious water to distract it or use your Relics to defeat it somehow.

The only possible way you can run is to sacrifice ten precious days of water, hoping to distract the beast long enough to make your escape. 

You fumble with your supplies, the panic making your fingers clumsy and uncooperative. Finally, you manage to release the water, which immediately catches the attention of the Borer.

As the creature lunges towards the water, you seize the opportunity to flee, your heart pounding in your ears as you dash away. The chilling sound of the Borer's jaw snapping shut behind you haunts your every step, but as the distance between you and the beast grows, so too does your hope of survival.

Navigating through the chaotic landscape of swirling sand and dancing petals, you vow never to take the presence of water for granted again in this treacherous realm. The Dune Devouring Borer serves as a grim reminder of the dangers that lurk beneath the beauty and wonder of the Abyss.
