!Layer 5 - Windswept Potpouri Sands
@@As you descend thrugh the huge vertical shaft, the walls lining it slowly begin to become smoother, warmer, and drier. Before long, it transitions completely from a wall of ice into a wall of sandstone. As the shaft begins to open up horizontally into the fifth layer proper, the wind, previously gentle and cold, begins to roar beneath you, whipping up the vast expanse of sand in this layer into neat-perpetual sandstorms. But sand isn't the only thing being scattered about by the wind.

For an area that otherwise bears such a strong resemblance to a surface desert, this layer is positively brimming with beautiful, colorful foliage, the petals of which chaotically dance in the wind, painting a shower of color against the backdrop of he ever-shifting dunes, and filling your nose with the scents of the world's best-stocked flower shop. Even the living flowers are astonishingly dry and fragrant, having long abandoned water and instead adapted to survive entirely on Miasma. Dotted about the layer, ruins carved from sandstone hide ancient secrets, telling the story of a long-gone civilization in a long-dead language.

:: Layer5 Exit1 [layer5]
Layer 5 is the last layer that anyone on the surface currently has any reliable knowledge of. Reports of what lies further below often contain vague strange, and contradictory information, and few emerging from dives that venture lower are in a state to be reporting information to begin with. This means that sources like the Encyclopedia Abyssia are unlikely to be helpful from here on. If you understand this, and still wish to descend further to depths beyond humanity's current understanding, the trip will take 13 days.

After walking through the tunnel for about 5 or 6 hours (it's hard to precisely keep track in there), you find yourself back at the same entrance you started walking into, despite absolutely never turning around.

And as soon as the harsh light of the fifth layer touches you, you notice your pack is suddenly much lighter! It seems that all of the items you brought with you into the Abyss have disappeared, presumably sent to the surface at a location which is suddenly intuitively available to your mind. <<if $ownedRelics.some(e => e.name === "Pocket Hoard")>>

Testing your Pocket Hoard, you stick a hand into the pink rucksack, but find you can easily stick your whole arm in. In fact, there doesn't seem to be any limit to what you can fit into the rucksack, as long as it fits into the opening, but you can easily retrieve anything you put in. You have successfully activated your Pocket Hoard! Your carrying capacity is now effectively infinite, and the value of your Pocket Hoard has increased to 100 dubloons.

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threaths that await you on the layer
