:: Libido Reinforcement A Description

Gives one level of the Libido Reinforcement Curse, which boosts your sex drive according to how many Libido Reinforcement effects you've taken. See the above table for details.

:: Gender Reversal A Description

Gives one level of Gender Reversal, which causes gradual changes in your body that cause you to appear as the gender opposite to what you were assigned at birth - see the above table for details. No effect on penis or boob size.

:: Asset Robustness A Description

Grows your boobs by about 1 cup size and/or increases your penis size by about 2.5cm (1in), dependng on what's applicable. For all Asset Robustness Curses, band and sizes and girth are scaled appropriately, and your assets will grow back to their new, increased size if surgically reduced.

:: Clothing Restriction A Description

Prevents you from ever wearing anything that would commonly be considered an \"accessory.\" Includes scarves, hats, piercings, pasties, jewelry, and so on. Kind of a bummer. Doesn't include items serving a specific necessary purpose, like prescription glasses. None of the Clothing restriction Curses include Relics if they are worn with the intention of making use of their effect.

:: Shrunken Assets Description

Decreases boob size/penis size to approximately minimal levels - about AA cup boobs ad a roughly 1cm (~0.5in) penis. They will resist surgical attempts at enhancement. Cannt be taken with any Asset Robustness Curses. (That's why you get so many poins for it.)

:: Hair Removal Description

Permaently removes all hair below your nose, and even shapes your eyebrows into a pleasing shape so you don't have to maintain them. Never shave again!

:: Perma-dye Description

Permanently changes your natural hair color to a significantly different, visually distinct color of your choice. You can choose if you want to go with a fun, weird color like purple or just stick with the normal human range.

:: Freckle Speckle Description

Gives you a splatter of freckles or moles around your body. You can arrange their exact locations and density, but they have to be a significant and noticeable feature. Make sure to include one of those nakibokuro under-eye beauty marks, they're super cute!

:: Knife-ear Description

Gives you a pair of sharp, pointy, elfish ears. There are some humans on the surface who get surgery to look like this, so you'll only kind of stick out up there!<br>Also effects any other ear-related Curses you take.

:: Dizzying Heights Description

Increases or decreases your current height by 5cm (2in), by your preference. This will take a very long time to get used to. All height changes in the Abyss must be in the same direction. (max. 5)

:: Increased Sensitivity Description

Significantly increases the sensitivity of your erogenous zones - even brief, soft stimulation will quickly bring you over the edge.

:: Refractory Refactorization Description

Removes your refractory period, allowing you to orgasm many times in quick succession. Has a noticeable effect regardless of your sexual equipment. Makes a powerful yet dangerous combo with Increased Sensitivity.

:: Libido Reinforcement B Description

Gives one level of the Libido Reinforcement Curse, boosting your sex drive.

:: Gender Reversal B Description

Gives one level of the Gender Reversal Curse, causing your body's apparent gender to gradually change.

:: Asset Robustness B Description

Grows your boobs by about 2 cup sizes and/or increased your penis size by about 5 cm (2in), depending on what's applicable. You can have Asset Robustness Curses affect butt sizes too if you like.

:: Age Reduction A Description

Reduces your apparent physical age by 2 years or sets it to 20, whichever is younger. Many might consider this a boon.

:: Fluffy Ears Description
You gain a set of ears from a (non-human) mammal of your choice on the top of your head, replacing your old ears. Be the kemonomimi you've always wanted to be.

:: Fluffy Tail Description

A tail from a mammal of your choice will spout from your lower back. You can take up to 9 if you're going for the kitsune or nekomata look or something, but only the first grants any corruption.

:: Maximum Fluff Description

Fur from a non-human mammal of your choice will grow over your entire body, forming a pelt. Cannot be chosen with the "Hair Removal" Curse, but i you like you can have this Curse override it instead, giving this Curse's points and effect and removing the points you got from Hair Removal.

:: Heat/Rut Description

For approximately one day a month, your libido will skyrocket, making it much harder to control yourself. Grants two temporary levels of the Libido Reinforcement Curse.

:: Lightweight Description

You take bonus damage from alcohol. Even a single beer will leave your speech a bit slurred and your reactions dulled, and drinking anything harder will almost certainly lead to you eventually blacking out.

Also enhances the effects of things like aphrodisiacs and recreational drugs, and even coffee. Just a sip of caffeine will lead to you being very hyper, jittery, and excitable.

:: Sex Switcheroo Description

If you have a penis, it'll retreat inwards and be replaced with a vagina and all other associated organs, along with breasts roughly proportionate to the size of penis you had as compared to the average. The reverse happens if you started with a vagina, and you'll gain a penis roughly proportionate to the size of your old boobs. (Flat boobs get a very small micropenis.)

:: Futa Fun Description

Has the same effect as Sex Switcheroo, but leaves you with a penis, a pair of boobs, and a vagina (You can decide if you want ball or not). All of your new parts will both be affected by all Asset Robustness or Shrunken Assets Curses from here onwards. Can't be taken with Sex Switcheroo. 

If you already have both a penis and a pair of breats, congrats on the free points! Well, maybe your bottom parts have changed, but it's less of a change for you than for somoene else taking this Curse.

:: Blushing Virgin Description

You'll find sexual activities and nudity to be uncomfortable and very embarassing. You can still do sexy stuff, you'll just be cutely embarassed and extremely bashful when doing so.

:: Submissiveness Rectification A Description

Makes you significantly more submissive to the desires of others, and even has minor effects outside of the bedroom. You'll still be able to refuse requests that you're strongly against, but you can give up any hope of taking a dominant role.

:: Gender Reversal C Description

Gives one level of the Gender Reversal Curse, causing your body's apparent gender to gradually change. Don't worry, I hear androgyny is in vogue!

:: Asset Robustness C Description

Grows your boobs by about 4 cup sizes and/or increases your penis size by about 10cm (4in), depending on what's applicable. You'll probably need to buy some new bras or underwear. 

:: Clothing Restriction B Description

Completely prevents you from wearing any kind of underwear, or anything at all covering you underneath your main outfit. Also includes socks. All Clothing Restriction Curses manifest as an extreme mental revulsion for wearing that type of clothing, changing to extreme mental distress and immediately attempting to remove it if you're somehow forcibly clothed.

:: Power Dom Description

Modifies your personality to cause you to become markedly more dominant, both in and out of the bedroom. You simply won't be able to sit still and let someone else take the lead, even in situations where you might have been more comfortable doing so previously. Cannot be taken with any Submissiveness Rectification Curses.

:: 20/20000000 Description

Gives you a severe case of all-around garbage eyes. It also makes them more sensitive, making contacts very uncomfortable - you could wear them on rare occasions, but they'd be hell to wear as part of a normal routine. Conjures up a durable yet kinda unstylish pair of glasses for your journey - you should pick out something more suitable when you get out of here.

:: Comic Relief Description

Severely reduces the odds of anyone taking you seriously in any social situation. People may see you as a cute clutz, or a silly loudmouthed braggart, or a quirky sex-obsessed weirdo, but they will almost never see you as an actual threat, source of wisdom, or a real leader. In the script of your life, you'll be the butt of every joke.

:: Equal Opportunity Description

You become 100% pansexual, to the extent that sex/gender is entirely irrelevant to you when evaluating how attractive someone is. Nothing like "okay I like them both, but I still prefer ________" here. If you already consider yourself this, then enjoy the free points!

:: Absolute Pregnancy Description

Absolutely any sex you have with another person will result in a viable pregnancy - even homosexual sex, so long as there's an available womb present in at least one of your bodies. No form of contraception or creative positioning (i.e. oral) can prevent this. Logic/fate will naturally prevent you from every having sex with anyone who has the Absolute Birth Control Curse, avoiding the whole unstoppable force/immovable object scenario.

:: Absolute Birth Control Description

Completely removes your ability to ever conceive a child with anyone else, as ither a mother or father. Cannot be taken with Absolute Pregnancy, Wacky Wombs, or Omnitool.

:: Wacky Wombs Description

Adds a functional womb+ovums to your body, connected to one of the following paths of your choice: your throat, urethra, anus, or side-by-side to an existing womb through a vaginal canal. Both male and females with this can be impregnated via penile penetration to the appropriate area. Your body will make the birthing process technically safe, but still probably pretty damn weird, kinda gross looking, and very painful. I guess that's pretty standard for pregnancy though?

:: Omnitool Description

Causes pregancy to always be a possibility when your have sex, regardless of species differences, Children will be a mixture of the two species.

:: Gooey Description

Causes your entire body to be made out of sticky, slimy unicolor goo. All the body altering Curses you received/will receive will cause your goo to roughly mimic the shape and texture of that feature - goo pelt, gooey tail, and so on. This will probably look quite odd with many Curses. Your goo is slightly malleable, but will quickly revert to the form given to you by Curses - no shapeshifting. Your durability and dietary restrictions are unchanged. 

:: Rainbow Swirl Description

Permanently changes your skin and eye colors to significantly different, visually distinct colors of your choice. You can choose if you want to go with unusual colors like pink or red, or just stick with the normal human range.

:: Double Pepperoni Description

Swells up your nipples, making them rather puffy, and noticeably increases the area of your areolae. Also makes them a bit more sensitive. Cute!

:: Literal Blushing Virgin Description

Whenever you're having sex, you'll temporarily lose your memory of all your past sexual encounters, leading you to believe every time is your first. If you have one, you can also choose to regenerate your hymen to "complete the effect" if you like. It's not really an accurate indicator of virginity, so it doesn't matter either way. 

:: Libido Reinforcement C Description

Gives one level of the Libido Reinforcement Curse, boosting your sex drive. Please always practice safe sex!

:: Lactation Rejuvenation A Description

Causes you to be lactating slightly at all times, about as much as an average pregnant woman. Not too annoying; may require occasional milking and cause wet spots on clothing sometimes.

:: Asset Robustness D Description

Grows your boobs by about 6 cup sizes and/or increases your penis size by about 15cm (6in), depending on what's applicable. The extra weight will take a while to get used to.

:: Age Reduction B Description

Reduces your physical apparent age by 3 years or sets it to 20, whichever is younger. This may put you at a disadvantage in the Abyss. It doesn't show any additional mercy to the young.

:: Sleep Tight Description

Makes your body require about 12 hours of sleep a day, but makes it always extremely comforting and pleasurable. If taken with Sweet Dreams, you will learn to embrace being wrapped in fear, your mind associating terror and helplessness with comfort. Note that the extra sleep at night translates to extra energy during the day, and so this has no impact on travel times here.

:: Sweet Dreams Description

Every single time you go to sleep, you'll have sexual nightmares that heavily blur the line between terrifying and horny, and which will almost always cause several orgasms. Hope you don't mind the extra laundry!

:: Hypno Happytime Description

Makes you particularly suggestible. Directly hypnotizing you is easy, but someone determined to do so could manage to do it even through subtle methods, like subliminal messaging in media or something. 

:: Crossdress Your Heart Description

Forces you to only wear clothing associated with the opposite genitals of those you have. Cannot be taken with Futa Fun or both Clothing Restrictions B and C at the same time.

:: Lie Detector Description

Anyone you communicate with will be able to instinctively tell whenever you're not being completely honest with them or hiding information they would want to know. Having to wear your heart on your sleeve can make life difficult in the long run.

:: Megadontia Description

Gives you some very sharp teeth. Be careful not to bite any partners! Also gives you 1-2 especially large teeth that will remain visible even with your mouth closed, giving you a perpetual smug-fang look.

:: Softie Description

If you have a penis, it will never be erect again. You can still orgasm, but you'll be flaccid the entire time. If you have a vagina, your nipples will be constantly inverted. Even if you were to try and pull them out, they'd just spring right back to their inverted state.

:: Hard Mode Description

If you have a penis, it will always be fully erect. If you have breasts, your nipples will constantly be erect, and probably visible through many kinds of clothing...maybe even with a bra, sometimes. If you have a vagina, it can make the clitoris a bit harder than normal too. Cannot be taken with Softie.

:: Lingual Leviathan Description

Increases the length of your tongue to approximately 30cm (12 in). You'll have to learn to eat carefully to avoid biting it, but you'll give amazing oral.

:: Tipping the Scales Description

Your body is completely covered with a layer of rigid scales in a color of your choice. Hairs will still grow from them in whatever places you would typically grow hairs, so it would look really weird with the Maximum Fluff Curse. Strong enough to protect you well from most human weapons, but not the vicious beasts of the Abyss. Notably not limited to reptile scales. You can do fish scales instead and go for the Zora look, if you like.

:: Reptail Description

Gives you a large, scaled, spiky reptile tail sprouting from your back. It would look pretty weird next to other tails if you have them, but there's nothing outright stopping you from taking this with the Fluffy Tail Curse or anything.

:: Cold Blooded Description

Changes your body's physiology to be similar to an ectotherm - that is, your body will produce negligible heat on its own, and you'll need to regularly heat it up via external sources, like sunlight (or Miasma light) so you don't freeze. I hope you like cuddling! Increases travel times in this layer by 1 day each if you don't use a portable source of heat. Without one, you'll need to stop and set up campfires very frequently.

:: Libido Reinforcement D Description

Gives one level of the Libido Reinforcement Curse, boosting your sex drive. Others may have a hard time keeping up with you.

:: Gender Reversal D Description

Gives one level of the Gender Reversal Curse, causing your body's apparent gender to gradually change. The grass is always greener, right?

:: Pleasure Respecification A Description

Completely prevents you from ever reaching climax on your own, through any form of masturbation or toys. You'll feel pleasure building, but release will be completely impossible without another party's help.

:: Clothing Restriction C Description

Prevents you from wearing any clothing generally considered of the primary part of an outfit - essentially anything not already covered by Clothing Restrictions A or B. Dresses, shirts, pants, skirts - all off the table. Also includes shoes.

:: Massacre Manicure Description

You'll grow sharp claws instead of fingernails. They can be retracted somewhat when not in use, but probably not quite as much as you would like. Fingering people is still possible, don't worry! Just...be very careful.

:: DoS Description

Causes you to feel pleasure when inflicting others with pain, but numbs feelings of physical pleasure from other sources somewhat.

:: DoM Description

Converts all pain you receive into pleasure, but in return, dulls normal feelings of physical pleasure a bit. With both S and M, you will cease to feel pleasure entirely except when inflicting or receiving pain.

:: Hijinks Ensue Description

Gives you bad luck with regards to embarrassing sexual situations, to a hilarious degree. You'll accidentally stumble into sex, have people stumble in on you when you're having sex, have embarrassing wardrobe malfunctions, and rarely ever get a moment of peace to yourself. Sexual shenanigans will find you and humiliate you no matter what measures you take.

:: Flower Power Description

Causes flowers and vines to sprout all over your body, and replaces your hair with leaves or flower petals. You can influence their shape and locations somewhat, so long as they're visible. At least you'll probably smell nice! As long as you don't go for a rafflesia or something, I mean.

:: Cellulose Description

Causes your skin to become smooth and slightly rigid, like plant matter. Can optionally include a layer of bark. Be careful around open flames!

:: Chlorophyll Description

Causes your body to require sunlight, or you will feel sluggish and low on energy. If you're wearing normal clothing on a sunny day, you'll need to spend about two hours in the sun daily to feel recharged, though you can reduce that to as low as 20 minutes if you sunbath nude. Thankfully, Miasma reactions will suffice in most layers of the Abyss, but you'll need to add 1 day of travel time for everything in layer 3, and anywhere else similarly dark.

:: Pheromones Description

Causes you to near-constantly release scentless pheromones that make everyone around you quite aroused. The effect is slightly directed towards you, but the people around you may end up directing their lust towards others if you're not their type or you don't make a move. It isn't a rape aura; people still have their good senses - they're just more impassioned than they otherwise would be.

:: Carapacian Description

Gives you a shiny, firm carapace or exoskeleton in the color of your choice surrounding about 80% of your body, only leaving small bits exposed around squishy areas and joints. Probably not strong enough to stand up to human weapons or creatures of the Abyss, but if might give you an edge in a fistfight?

:: Hemospectrum Description

Changes your blood into a color that is unnatural for humans, like purple or blue or green. You can decide what shade you'd like.

:: Wriggly Antennae Description

Sprouts a pair of wriggling insect antennae from your forehead. They're sensitive to touch and you can taste things through them, so keep them clean!

:: Eggxellent Description

If you have a penis, it will function similarly to an ovipositor, releasing eggs during ejaculation rather than semen. If you have a vagina, laying eggs will replace both periods (egg laying will still occur even if periods would normally be prevented via Relics or medically) and live births. (They can replace live births for any extra non-vaginal wombs you have too.)

:: Submissiveness Rectification B Description

Causes you to become more submissive, like the Submissiveness Rectification A Curse. With two of them, you become physically incapable of resisting any request made of you except orders that would cause death or lasting damage to yourself or others. (Requests like "be my slave indefinitely" or "give me everything you own" would constitute lasting damage.)

:: Lactation Rejuvenation B Description

Induces Permanent lactation, like the Lactation Rejuvenation A Curse. With two of them, your lactation will reach ridiculous levels normally impossible in humans or really any animal, requiring frequent milking throughout the day to prevent discomfort, temporarily increasing boob sizes at a rapid pace, and being capable of long, sustained milk streams at full capacity.

:: Pleasure Respecification B Description

Completely prevents you from ever climaxing from any sexual act with another person - you'll feel pleasure building, but release is only possible with masturbation. With both Pleasure Respecification A and B, orgasms of any kind become completely impossible, except when directly caused by a Curse.

:: Age Reduction C Description

Reduces your apparent physical age by 4 years or sets it to 20, whichever is younger. You probably won't be able to carry as much weight as you used to if you end up particularly young.

:: Horny Description

You get a noticeable horn in the shape of your choice sprouting from your head. It's strong, but quite sensitive to touch.

:: Drawing Spades Description

Gives you a cute spade-tipped demon tail. It's a major new erogenous zone, and its prehensility lends itself very well to being used creatively in sex. Occasionally may act on its own, attempting to pleasure you or others based on your subconscious desires.

:: Tattoo Tally Description

You will have several small faintly-glowing runic tattoos across your body, culminating in one particularly large tattoo centered just above your pubic mound. These tattoos are very sensitive, and anyone who sees them will instantly be able to know the full breadth of your sexual history: total number of times having sex, number of different partners, how recently you last had sex, the kinds of fetishes you've indulged in, total volume of sexual fluids you've had in you... there's a lot of statistics there, and they'll see it all.

:: Leaky Description

Your genitals will be abnormally lubricated at all times, with precum/vaginal lubricant. It'll get even worse if you're aroused at all, and you'll definitely have a stream going down your legs without a great deal of prior preparation. Expect a lot of fluid to be released when you orgasm. You'll be producing about twice as much as an average person, and this Curse about doubles fluid increases gained from eating Crumbleweeds in the previous layer. Also causes your fluids to take on an unusual flavor of your choice, without affecting their appearance.

:: Wandering Hands Description

Causes your body to subconsciously seek sexual release when you're not focusing on it, regardless of how aroused you are. You'll be writing an essay with one hand, and won't even notice your other hand masturbating until you're close to climax. Or you might absentmindedly grope your own chest in the middle of a conversation with a friend. In more serious cases, you could even find yourself grinding against objects or other people, and your lack of control will be especially apparent in your sleep. The effects can be largely nullified by wearing a vibrator or similar sex toy near-constantly.

:: Semen Demon Description

Requires you to drink at least 10ml of sexual fluids (semen or vaginal fluids) daily, or you will suffer symptoms of starvation. For reference, a single ejaculation is typically around 5ml, give or take, in both cases. Companions you have may help you if you have a good relationship, but a single companion would probably have trouble feeding you all on their own if you need a lot. You could try to supplement your diet with fluids from beasts of the Abyss - though the time spent doing so would likely substantially increase all travel times down here. This Curse can supply nutrition in place of food, but the Miasma prevents this from working inside the Abyss, unfortunately. You'll still need to eat real food too, while you're down here. You can get +15 extra corruption by restricting yourself to either semen or vaginal fluids exclusively.

:: Quota Description

Requires you to cause others a total of 2 orgasms per day via direct contact with your body, or you will experience a severe drop in energy, characteristic of heavy sleep deprivation. The quota is increased to 3 orgasms if taken in combination with Sleep Tight. This can replace sleep, but the Miasma prevents this from working inside the Abyss. I hope you've been kind to your companions, or you'll need to waste a lot of potential travel time pleasuring some monsters down here.

:: In the Limelight Description

Requires you to be the primary source of at least 50 orgasms daily, or you will completely cease feeling joy, falling into a deep depression where any kind of productive effort is impossible. Unlike Quota, this can be via indirect means, such as media you're featured in being masturbated to. Your (mis)adventures in the Abyss will from here on out be magically recorded and transmitted to a great deal of people to achieve this, but you should probably try to be just a bit more provocative than usual, just to be sure. If you earn enough fans while you're down here, you could make a career for yourself after you leave!

:: Libido Reinforcement E Description

Gives one level of the Libido Reinforcement Curse. I hope your standards aren't too high, or you might be in for a bit of frustration.

:: Gender Reversal E Description

Gives one level of the Gender Reversal Curse, causing your body's apparent gender to gradually change. Whether you're going for the trap/reverse trap look or going all the way, I'm sure you'll look great!

:: Asset Robustness E Description

Grows your boobs by about 8 cup sizes and/or increases your penis size by about 20cm (8in), depending on what's applicable. This will probably be very inconvenient for you.

:: Urine Reamplification A Description

Significantly reduces your bladder capacity. Though annoying, this shouldn't be too dangerous so long as you're careful. Urine Reamplification Curses also prevent the Event Horizon Relic from taking care of your pee for you.

:: Barter System Description

Any kind of circulating currency you gain, physical or digital, will just seem to mysteriously vanish. In fact, the only way you have of paying for things is via sexual favors. Thankfully, most vendors will be a lot more receptive to this idea than they would have been before...but not at Outset Town's! Better give your dubloons to a companion before you take this Curse, and let them handle buying and selling things. (You cannot give the vending machines sexual favors, either. Please don't fuck the vending machines.)

:: Shared Space Description

Everybody around you will feel incredibly comfortable touching you and groping you, and the concept of "personal space" won't exist for you. You'll always be seen in the wrong if you try to point it out.

:: Weakling Description

Causes your physical strength to drop to hilarious, absurdly low levels. Your comfortable long-term carrying capacity drops to 5kg, and your short-term strength isn't much better. You'll also probably be much worse off in a fight, especially with melee weaponry. This affects your essence more than your physical musculature, so you could train and train and become positively sculpted, or even cur off your arms and replace them with robotics, and you wouldn't be any stronger. It won't reduce your strength in ways that could be hazardous to your health or prevent normal locomotion, though.

:: Random Orgasms Description

Once a day, you will suffer a powerful, unprompted orgasm, with no warning whatsoever. Can be very embarrassing if you're in public.

:: Beastly Description

Causes you to subconsciously take on many animalistic traits, including but not limited to: inability to "speak" except with simplistic, unintelligible noises, extreme discomfort at using human toilets and preferring to either do your business outside or use a litterbox, preferring to clean yourself via licking rather than taking a bath, and really enjoying headpats. Causes you to take on stereotypical traits specific to any kind of specific fantasy animals or fantasy races you might have become, too. Doesn't affect intelligence, but may affect how intelligent others perceive you to be.

:: Creature of the Night Description

You become a vampire. You'll burst into flames in direct sunlight, though you can reduce this to just significant discomfort and itchiness with copious sunblock and/or a parasol. You don't have a pulse anymore, and by some measures, you're no longer among the living...though your body can still be stopped by the same kinds of physical force that would kill a human. Your skin has an odd, unearthly look to it, the lack of life in you being very apparent. You need to suck some blood to survive, but not that much...about one 3 minute feeding session weekly would be enough, and it's perfectly survivable for the donor, though draining. This doesn't replace your normal dietary requirements or anything, though. You require verbal permission to enter any private homes owned by someone else. You no longer age, and your body is immune to most diseases and toxins, allowing you to suck blood without fear from catching anything from your victim. All other classic vampire weaknesses and strengths don't apply to you.

:: Minish-ish Description

Reduces your height to about 10-20cm (4-8in), the rest of your bodily proportions following suit. This will have major effects on the remainder of your journey. Many Relics may be difficult or impossible to use. You will probably be unable to carry any weight of consequence, or engage in any kind of combat. If you don't have a companion to carry you or some other method of overcoming your slower movement, double all time costs. Your new metabolic rate means you need 1/4 as much food and water as you did before, but you need to actually have some method of carrying all that extra food and water to take advantage of this.

:: Colossal-able Description

Increases your height to roughly 100m (330ft), the rest of your proportions following suit. This will have major effects on the remainder of your journey. You will be able to carry a lot more than before, but the difficulties of moving around the Abyss with your new huge body, finding alternate larger routes, and being careful of your footing, will slow you down a lot: double all time costs. You are probably a bit better off in combat than before, but many of the vicious beasts of the Abyss are no stranger to taking down threats much larger than them, being fast and wily enough to still be major obstacles to you. Can't be taken with Minish-ish.

:: Libido Reinforcement F Description

Gives one level of the Libido Reinforcement Curse. Please don't end up on any sexual offender lists!

:: Gender Reversal F Description

Gives one level of the Gender Reversal Curse, causing your body's apparent gender to gradually change. Do you like the way your body looks now?

:: Asset Robustness F Description

Grows your boobs by about 16 cup sizes and/or increases your penis size by about 40cm (16in), depending on what's applicable. We're well into territory that could be considered a medical condition, now.

:: Urine Reamplification B Description

Completely removes your ability to judge how full your bladder is, or hold it when it's full. Expect a lot of accidents, especially with Urine Reamplification A. Can be managed if you make using the restroom very frequently a habit, but be careful.

:: Eye on the Prize Description

Gouges out one of the two eyes you were born with. (This might sting a little... and then a lot, for a long time. The wound will be sealed to prevent infection.) @@.italic; This could have major effects on your journey.@@ Losing one eye, and with it depth perception, will make many basic tasks difficult, rendering you much less capable of dealing with Threats. Losing both eyes will render you incapable of much of anything down here on your own. Even with a companion, you should assume a great deal of lost travel time, as they will need to slow their pace greatly to assist you. Can be taken twice if you still have both organic eyes.

:: Deafening Silence Description

You will be rendered completely deaf, incapable of ever processing sound again. Potentially a very dangerous condition to have in the Abyss, reducing you ability to react to threats and making communication with companions more difficult.

You can get an extra +10 corruption if you allow your ears to be violently ripped off, then sealed to prevent infection - so long as you have no other Curses affecting the ears.

:: Taciturn Turnaround Description

Renders you completely mute, incapable of ever uttering a sound again. Will undoubtably cast troubles on your journey if you're with a companion.

You can get an extra +25 corruption by volunteering to have your tongue violently ripped out (and the wound magically sealed up), simultaneously removing your sense of taste, but you can't choose to do so if you took Lingual Leviathan.

:: Ampu-Q-tie Description

Rips off one of your four limbs, about halfway up from the knee or elbow. (It's okay if you want to scream from the pain. The wound will be sealed up safely.) Prevents organic replacements from ever working, but you can get prosthetic replacements. @@.italic;This will likely have major effects on your journey.@@ Expect your carrying capacity to be heavily impacted for any arms you've lost, and in the absence of an appropriate countermeasure, you can expect insurmountable increases in travel time costs for losing any legs, likely forcing you to just give up and accept your fate. If you have a companion carry you the probably won't be able to carry much of anything else, and will be moving much slower than they would otherwise... even without limbs, humans are heavy. Can only be taken for organic, intact limbs.

:: Nose Goes Description

Removes your sense of smell permanently. A relatively tame drawback that probably won't trouble you too much down here, but you'll miss out on the smells of freshly-cooked food, or of a flower garden on a balmy summer day, or of a refreshing salty ocean breeze... you'll probably miss them eventually.

:: Arm Army Description

Adds an extra arm of leg in roughly the same spot your normal ones are. If you prefer, you could also have additional legs turn you into a centaur. Either way, the extra limbs will probably get in the way quite a bit and require years of practice before you're half as good at using them as you were before. This may slow down your travels or lower your ability to defend yourself. Limbs can be succesfully amputated @@.italic;if@@ immediately replaced with prosthetics.

Cannot be taken with Ampu-Q-tie. (max. 6)

:: A Little Extra Description

Takes whetever sexual equipment you have between your legs and adds another copy of it down there. You can decide the exact configuration. If you have both a penis and a vagina, you may choose which gets copied.

:: Null Description

Completely removes your genitals. You'll just have a smooth patch of skin on your groin, like a doll. Any waste that would've exited through there will instead be heading out the back door. Also removes your nipples, again leaving a smooth patch of skin in their place. If any Curse has its effects entirely negated by this, you lose the corruption points it gave you. Some Curses could be altered a bit, like Leaky lubricating your back door, or having Asset Robustness Curses that previously affected a penis now apply to boobs, while others will be inevitably be lost. Naturally, cannot be taken with A Little Extra.

I hope you really like oral and/or anal!

:: Seafolk Description

In place of legs, you now have a finned tail, allowing you to quickly swim through water. It also grants you a pair of gills in the position of your choice, allowing you to breathe underwater with ease. @@.italic; This doesn't seem like a very practical appendage in the Abyss!@@ Expect all the same drawbacks you would see if you took Ampu-Q-tie for your legs, but even greater as you still have the weight of your legs, just none of the function. You can get an extra +10 corruption if you elect to have your lungs completely adapt to being underwater, unable to breathe air. (This would probably be a bad idea.)

Cannot be taken with Ampu-Q-tie directed at the legs - requires both legs to still be there. 

:: Taken for Granite Description

Whenever you orgasm, you'll temporarily be petrified, turned into a completely immobile stone. The first time you orgasm in a given day, you'll be unpetrified after 5 minutes, but this will @@.italic;double@@ with each additional orgasm you have, only resetting at midnight. If you're petrified when the clock hits midnight, you'll still have to wait out your current timer. You'll sense what's going on around you when you're petrified just as well as you would normally, but will appear to the rest to the rest of the world as a completely immobile statue. Physical damage done to your stone form will be healed when you reform, but mental damage won't.

If you're completely unable to orgasm due to the effects of Pleasure Respecification Curses, this will instead turn you to stone for a random 2 hour, non-sleeping period each day.

:: Double Trouble Description

You have a twin now! This requires some explanations.

They look near-identical to you, are near-identical genetically, and have all the same curses you've picked, but can optionally have the opposite genitals. The rest the world, including relatives and companions, will recall the both of you having always been twins, and having ventured down tino the Abyss together. @@.italic;They@@ will remember a history where they ventured down on their own (with any companions), and where @@.italic;you@@ appeared after they took this Curse. For all you know, they could be right! (You'll find all the items you remember carrying down here on the fround between the two of you.) They could theoretically choose different Curses than you do from here on, but they have very similar tastes to you, so the probably won't.

They'll need to eat too, so you should be @@.italic;doubling@@ the number of resources you consume each day. I really don't recommend trying to betray them or abuse them for gain, or trying to set them up as any kind of "dump stat character" - this is @@.italic;you@@ we're talking about here, kind of, so your odds with any scheme would be at most 50/50.

Mechanically, you can consider them as a second avatar of "you" for most purposses - for example, they offer no additional uses of the Gossamery Scales, Icon of Mercy will remove the same Curse from you both simultaneously, Ring of the Devourer will give absorbed powers to both of you, Relics will deduct from both of your corruptions regardless of who picks it up, and so on. They offer a potential gameplay benefit in splitting up, providing a hand in carrying things, or fighting, but no other intrinsic mechanical benefits.

You might be disinclined to trust them in light of some other features of this layer, but this one's not one of @@.italic;them@@ ;they're genuinely in the same boat as you. At least so long as they don't get captured by an Inanis Ego - their conversion conditions are the same as yours. 

:: Conjoined Description

Pick on of your hired companions, or your twin from the Double Trouble Curse if you took it. You and that person are now conjoined, either from the hip down, chest down, or simply being two heads sharing a body. Separation would be fatal for both of you even before considering Curse rebound effects. Your conjoined body will not have the "purity gene", and will slowly take on the effects of any Curses you have (though they will be less pronounced on the other person's half if they don't have those same Curses.)

You each control half of your shared body, and movement will be very difficult. Add 1 day to all travel times down here. If you're conjoined to a companion, any physical skills will probably be rendered useless by the fusion, and they'll prpbably be estremely freaked out, with morale at an all time low. If you're conjoined with your twin, they'll probably be cool with it, though. They're just as okay with it as you are.

@@.bold;This Curse and Double Trouble are unique in that they cannot be stored with Managed Misfortune, or removed, transferred or copied with any Wonders.@@

:: Libido Reinforcement G Description

Gives one level of the Libido Reinforcement Curse. I hope your standards aren't too high, or you might be in for a bit of frustration.

:: Gender Reversal G Description

Gives one level of the Gender Reversal Curse, causing your body's apparent gender to gradually change. Whether you're going for the trap/reverse trap look or going all the way, I'm sure you'll look great!

:: Asset Robustness G Description

Grows your boobs by about 32 cup sizes and/or increases your penis size by about 80cm (32in), depending on what's applicable. This is simply ridiculous.

:: Literalization Description

This Curse is unique among all other Curses of the Abyss in that it can only be selected if you have certain prerequisite Curses. It takes some of the changes built up by the other Curses and completely removes all vestiges of your humanoid form, turning you into a true beast. You may select to be transformed into one of the options below if you already have all the prerequisite Curses. All your other curses will now apply to your new form in strange and interesting ways.
1) Literally a non-human mammal: Fluffy Ears, Fluffy Tail, Maximum Fluff
2) Literally a quadruped reptile or dragon: Lingual Leviathan, Tipping the Scales, Reptail
3) Literally an insect or arachnid: Carapacian, Hemospectrum, Minish-ish
4) Literally a plant (not recommended): Flower Power, Cellulose, Chlorophyll
5) Literally a twisted, hellish, conventionally unsexy mythological demon: Horny, Drawing Spades
6) Literally a fish (not recommended): Seafolk
7) Literally a tentacle beast, identical to those of earlier layers: Tickly Tentacles, A Mouthful

:: Consent Dissent Description

Every manner of sexual encounter you experience from this point forward will be fated to be rape. Whether you're being held down by soomeone stronger than you and forced into it against your will, or terrorizing some poor innocent person and scarring them for life, you will never have happy, loving, consensual sex again. Doesn't actually affect the rate of success for you being a victim of or committing rape (it doesn't force you to get raped or become a rapist), but it will make attempts of the former more common. If taken with the Barter System Curse, nobody will agree to sex in exchange for giving you things, and you'll probably have to turn to a life of crime just to survive. If you're thinking you can fool the abyss with roleplay, where you or the other person's actual consent depart from what is stated, you can try it, but don't be shocked if the Abyss turns the tables on you. Moral and legal conduct on your part will probably require either celibacy, or some way to fulfill your desires without trying to have sex with others.

:: The Maxim Description

Pick one: urethra, vaginal canal, anus. You now have a larval Chasm Crawler, a parasite unique to the Abyss, squirming around up there. It feeds off your bodily fluids, and will frequently directly stimulate your most sensitive areas in order to get you to produce more. It is not a gentle creature, and it might get a bit violent with your bits if it decides you're not producing enough. After a few weeks, with a body about five times the size it started with, its life cycle will be complete, and it will burst into hundreds of new larval Chasm Crawlers for you to expel. At least one Chasm Crawler will always remain within you, ready to begin the cycle anew. I recommend cooperating with it and keeping it happy. Chasm Crawlers are very intelligent and knowledgeable about anatomy, and can quickly (though not painlessly) worm their way up and take direct control of your brain if your actions threaten them. It may be possible to reach a reasonable understanding with a Chasm Crawler. They're not kind, and not particularly trustworthy, but their intelligence causes them to value a cooperative host.

:: Adverse Possession Description

Your body is now home to a malevolent spirit that perished in the Abyss long ago, twisted by the ages and the Miasma. It is not your friend. Every other 24-hour period, it will gain full control of your body, with you sitting in the backseat, aware of and feeling everything it does, but being unable to stop any of it. This spirit will have sex with people you hate, put you in awful, humiliating situations, and try to ruin your day any way it can think of. It probably won't permanently ruin your life, since it does share your body, but it absolutely will not give you a fun time. It won't hamper your efforts to climb out of the Abyss, since it wants out of here too, but it'll be playing by its own rules. Why is it doing this? It wants full control. If you decide to give up and hand over full control of your body permanently, it will become noticeably gentler, though its tastes still differ enough from yours that you'll see and feel your body doing many things you'd rather not. (The reverse, getting it to give up control, is 100% impossible.) You'll have a long time to learn to love it, though.

:: Erased Description

Completely erases your old identity from the world. Nobody will have any memory of you going down into the Abyss, or who you are, and there will be no records, no citizenship, no property in your name - it will be as if you had never existed up there to begin with. Your own memories will be quite fuzzy, too: your presumed name and appearance before you came down are gone forever, never retrievable, and you'll have vague memories of your old life, but they'll be too fuzzy and feel unreal enough that you'll begin to doubt them too. Memories after you entered the Abyss will be unaffected. Companions will be disoriented at first, but should be able to piece things together since they've been down here with you this long. Doesn't erase debt to Outset Town's shop.

:: Tickly Tentacles Description

Grow one big, meaty tendril of a tentacle from somewhere on your body. Did you know that octopi have two thirds of their neurons in their tentacles, giving them a distributed nervous system fundamentally different from human brains? You'll have some degree of control over your tentacles, but they decide many of their actions on their own, and you may not always agree with their decisions. They'll often abuse and exploit your body - and perhaps the bodies of others in entirely inappropriate situations - in lewd ways. Individually, they may not be as smart as you, but collectively, all bets are off.

:: Eye-scream Description

Grow one large additional eye in a spot where there really shouldn't be one. It can receive sensory information, but it's not nearly as high-fidelity or useful as the two eyes you were born with. This is compounded with the 20/20000000... Curse, which would leave the eyes blurred enough to be functionally useless...I don't think they make glasses for your special eyes, though it's probably not impossible that someone with great skill could come up with something. 

:: A Mouthful Description

Grow one large, grinning mouth somewhere on your body where there really shouldn't be one. Will take on any related Curses that would affect your original mouth. I really recommend not looking too deeply into them to figure out how, but food that is put into them will reach your stomach.

:: Below the Veil Description

You have touched the void and tasted just a hint of the Truth, and you will never be the same. Your appearance up until now has merely been a mask, one that is now paper-thin, quickly eroded under the gaze of others. Anyone observing you in any way will feel a primal fear creep into them, quickly replaced by what can only be called insanity. This will make any kind of constructive interaction with others effectively impossible, and traveling with any companions will be completely impractical - even if you somehow managed to get them to stay with you, your presence would quickly render them useless.

As the miasmic energy of the Curse cascades over you, an unexpected shudder races down your spine. It feels like an icy gust, chilling the very marrow in your bones. The sensation isn't painful, but it's distinctly alien, like something deep in your cells is being rewritten.

Looking down, you study your hands, battle-hardened and calloused from the grueling expedition into the Abyss. There's a subtle shift; your knuckles, once rugged and pronounced, seem softer. The skin stretched over them gains a hint of delicacy, a touch of refinement. The veins that once stood out, bold against your skin, now subtly fade, murmuring beneath the surface like a secret.

A thrum resonates through your muscles, a vibrational shift that sets your heart pounding against your ribcage. It feels as if your sinews are shifting beneath the skin in your chest. Your biceps, triceps, shoulders – they all seem to contract, their robust mass receding to reveal a more slender, elongated definition. There's not too much of a loss of strength, rather a redistribution, a balance between power and grace.

The Curse softens the structure of your face. Your jawline, once chiseled and prominent, smoothens into a gentler curve. Your cheekbones elevate subtly, crafting a more pronounced structure, while your eyes seem to gain depth, their expressiveness enhanced. The changes are minute, barely noticeable, yet undeniably present.

The scent of your skin shifts, the potent musk replaced with a lighter, sweeter aroma. It's neither floral nor fruity, but a softer variant of your own scent. Your body hair retreats, each strand becoming finer, sparser. Your skin, once rugged and resilient, now has a subtle sense of softness.

As you process these changes, you can't help but wonder about your future. Will the transformations halt here? Or will they persist, relentlessly morphing you until you're a stranger to yourself?

Your waist cinches subtly, crafting a gentle curve that seamlessly blends into your hips. The shift is gentle, but perceptible. You move with a newfound fluidity, each step, each gesture carrying an inherent, rhythmic grace.

The feminization of your facial features persists, yielding an almost sculptural beauty. Your lips seem fuller, tinged with a slight rosy hue, their cupid's bow more pronounced. Your eyelashes appear longer, their feathery fringe lending a hint of innocence to your gaze. Your eyebrows arch delicately, adding another layer of femininity to your countenance.

The texture of your hair transforms, each strand gaining a silk-like softness. The color remains consistent, yet there's a newfound depth, a vibrancy that was previously absent. It's as if the very core of you is being refined, filtered into this new form.

A familiar cascade of cold, miasma energy washes through you as your transformation continues, steadfast and insistent, sculpting you into a form that straddles the line between masculinity and femininity.

Your waist, sleek and streamlined, flows into your hips, which have broadened just enough to add a soft curvature to your figure.

Your body hair has receded dramatically, leaving your skin smooth and unblemished, without any of the roughness that would be expected of a typical man. The scent that emanates from you is intriguingly ambiguous, neither distinctly masculine nor feminine, but a harmonious blend that is as unique as your evolving form.

Your face hosts the most captivating changes. Your features are a medley of softened angles and gentle curves. Your lips, eyes, cheekbones; all of them exist beyond traditional binary definitions, giving you an ethereal, otherworldly allure.

Your voice is now a mellifluous harmony that flows like a smooth melody. It's not high-pitched but rather a softer tone that carries the strength of your past and the elegance of your present.

As you ponder the transformations, you can't help but question how this new form, this blend of masculine and feminine, would affect your interactions, your relationships, and your self-perception. Will you be ostracized or embraced?

The bone-deep chill of the Abyss pierces your skin, yet this icy embrace is counteracted by an internal, enigmatic warmth. It starts as a soft, pulsating glow at your very core, then radiates outward, seeping into your extremities, fingers and toes alike. It feels akin to liquid sunlight coursing through your veins, a peculiarly energizing transformation that sets your heart aflutter, blending anticipation with a dash of trepidation.

Your hands, previously relatively soft and delicate, start to manifest a newfound robustness. You flex them, mesmerized by the sight of the sinewy tendons undulating beneath the skin. There's an unfamiliar hardness to them now, an intriguing resilience that marks the onset of your transformation. The muscles in your forearms respond, subtly bulging as your grip tightens, marking a slight but undeniable shift.

The transformative wave doesn't bypass your physique. The gentle curves that once adorned your figure begin to subtly realign, your waist losing its pronounced tapering. In exchange, your shoulders start broadening, paving the way for burgeoning muscles that ripple under the skin, sculpting a firm, athletic build.

The transformation nudges you into a realm of introspection, pondering what the future stages might bring. Amidst the subtle shifts in your physique and voice, you remain fundamentally you, yet stronger and more formidable.

A familiar wave of cold, miasmal energy engulfs you as the next level of the Curse takes hold. The tingling sensation reemerges, now paired with a deep, resonant hum that vibrates within your bones, infusing you with an energy that oscillates between the foreign and exhilarating.

Your body persists in its transformation, muscles carving out more defined silhouettes. Biceps, triceps, quadriceps – each hardens, the skin stretched over them taut and lean. The contours of your body sharpen, the former softness gradually usurped by a raw, primal strength. An unexpected satisfaction stirs within as you explore your new form, admiring the sturdy arms and the muscular strength pulsing in your legs.
