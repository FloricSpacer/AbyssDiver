:: Libido Reinforcement A Description

Gives one level of the Libido Reinforcement Curse, which boosts your sex drive according to how many Libido Reinforcement effects you've taken. See the above table for details.

:: Gender Reversal A Description

Gives one level of Gender Reversal, which causes gradual changes in your body that cause you to appear as the gender opposite to what you were assigned at birth - see the above table for details. No effect on penis or boob size.

:: Asset Robustness A Description

Grows your boobs by about 1 cup size and/or increases your penis size by about 2.5cm (1in), dependng on what's applicable. For all Asset Robustness Curses, band and sizes and girth are scaled appropriately, and your assets will grow back to their new, increased size if surgically reduced.

:: Clothing Restriction A Description

Prevents you from ever wearing anything that would commonly be considered an \"accessory.\" Includes scarves, hats, piercings, pasties, jewelry, and so on. Kind of a bummer. Doesn't include items serving a specific necessary purpose, like prescription glasses. None of the Clothing restriction Curses include Relics if they are worn with the intention of making use of their effect.

:: Shrunken Assets Description

Decreases boob size/penis size to approximately minimal levels - about AA cup boobs ad a roughly 1cm (~0.5in) penis. They will resist surgical attempts at enhancement. Cannt be taken with any Asset Robustness Curses. (That's why you get so many poins for it.)

:: Hair Removal Description

Permaently removes all hair below your nose, and even shapes your eyebrows into a pleasing shape so you don't have to maintain them. Never shave again!

:: Perma-dye Description

Permanently changes your natural hair color to a significantly different, visually distinct color of your choice. You can choose if you want to go with a fun, weird color like purple or just stick with the normal human range.

:: Freckle Speckle Description

Gives you a splatter of freckles or moles around your body. You can arrange their exact locations and density, but they have to be a significant an noticeable feature. make sure to include one of those nakibokuro under-eye beauty marks, they're super cute!

:: Knife-ear Description

Gives you a pair of sharp, pointy, elfish ears. There are some humans on the surface who get surgery to look like this, so you'll only kind of stick out up there!<br>Also effects any other ear-related Curses you take.

:: Dizzying Heights Description

Increases or decreases your current height by 5cm (2in), by your preference. This will take a very long time to get used to. All height changes in the Abyss must be in the same direction. (max. 5)

:: Increased Sensitivity Description

Significantly increases the sensitivity of your erogenous zones - even brief, soft stimulation will quickly bring you over the edge.

:: Refractory Refactorization Description

Removes your refractory period, allowing you to orgasm many times in quick succession. Has a noticeable effect regardless of your sexual equipment. Makes a powerful yet dangerous combo with Increased Sensitivity.

:: Libido Reinforcement B Description

Gives one level of the Libido Reinforcement Curse, boosting your sex drive.

:: Gender Reversal B Description

Gives one level of the Gender Reversal Curse, causing your body's apparent gender to gradually change.

:: Asset Robustness B Description

Grows your boobs by about 2 cup sizes and/or increased your penis size by about 5 cm (2in), depending on what's applicable. You can have Asset Robustness Curses affect butt sizes too if you like.

:: Age Reduction A Description

Reduces your apparent physical age by 2 years or sets it to 20, whichever is younger. Many might consider this a boon.

:: Fluffy Ears Description
You gain a set of ears from a (non-human) mammal of your choice on the top of your head, replacing your old ears. Be the kemonomimi you've always wanted to be.

:: Fluffy Tail Description

A tail from a mammal of your choice will spout from your lower back. You can take up to 9 if you're going for the kitsune or nekomata look or something, but only the first grants any corruption.

:: Maximum Fluff Description

Fur from a non-human mammal of your choice will grow over your entire body, forming a pelt. Cannot be chosen with the "Hair Removal" Curse, but i you like you can have this Curse override it instead, giving this Curse's points and effect and removing the points you got from Hair Removal.

:: Heat/Rut Description

For approximately one day a month, your libido will skyrocket, making it much harder to control yourself. Grants two temporary levels of the Libido Reinforcement Curse.

:: Lightweight Description

You take bonus damage from alcohol. Even a single beer will leave your speech a bit slurred and your reactions dulled, and drinking anything harder will almost certainly lead to you eventually blacking out.

Also enhances the effects of things like aphrodisiacs and recreational drugs, and even coffee. Just a sip of caffeine will lead to you being very hyper, jittery, and excitable.

:: Sex Switcheroo Description

If you have a penis, it'll retreat inwards and be replaced with a vagina and all other associated organs, along with breasts roughly proportionate to the size of penis you had as compared to the average. The reverse happens if you started with a vagina, and you'll gain a penis roughly proportionate to the size of your old boobs. (Flat boobs get a very small micropenis.)

:: Futa Fun Description

Has the same effect as Sex Switcheroo, but leaves you with a penis, a pair of boobs, and a vagina (You can decide if you want ball or not). All of your new parys will both be affected by all Asset Robustness or Shrunken Assets Curses from here onwards. Can't be taken with Sex Switcheroo. 

If you already have both a penis and a pair of breats, congrats on the free points! Well, maybe your bottom parts have changed, but it's less of a change for you than for somoene else taking this Curse.

:: Blushing Virgin Description

You'll find sexual activities and nudity to be uncomfortable and very embarassing. You can stilldo sexy stuff, you'll just be cutely embarassed and extremely bashful when doing so.

:: Submissiveness Rectification A Description

Makes you significantly more submissive to the desires of others, and even has minor effects outside of the bedroom. You'll still be able to refuse requests that you're strongly against, but you can give up any hope of taking a dominant role.

:: Gender Reversal C Description

Gives one level of the Gender Reversal Curse, causing your body's apparent gender to gradually change. Don't worry, I hear androgyny is in vogue!

:: Asset Robustness C Description

Grows your boobs by about 4 cup sizes and/or increases your penis size by about 10cm (4in), depending on what's applicable. You'll probably need to buy some new bras or underwear. 

:: Clothing Restriction B Description

Completely prevents you from wearing any kind of underwear, or anything at all covering you underneath your main outfit. Also includes sock. All Clothing Restriction Curses manifest as an extreme mental revulsion for wearing that type of clothing, changing to extreme mental distress and immediate;y attempting to remove it if you're somehow forcibly clothed.

:: Power Dom Description

Modifies your personality to cause you to become markedly more dominant, both in and out of the bedroom. Your simply won't be able to sit still and let someone else take the lead, even in situations where you might have been more comfortable doing so previously. Cannot be taken with any Submissiveness Rectification Curses.

:: 20/20000000 Description

Gives you a severe case of all-around garbage eyes. It also makes them more sensitive, making contacts very uncomfortable - you could wear them on rare occasions, but they'd be hell to wear as part of a normal routine. Conjures up a durable yet kinda unstylish pair of glasses for your journey - you should pick out something more suitable when you get out of here.

:: Comic Relief Description

Severely reduces the odds of anyone taking you seriously in any social situation. People may see you as a cute clutz, or a silly loudmouthed braggart, or a quirky sex-obsessed weirdo, but they will almost never see you as an actual threat, source of wisdom, or a real leader. In the script of your life, you'll be the butt of every joke.

:: Equal Opportunity Description

You become 100% pansexual, to the extent that sex/gender is entirely irrelevant to you when evaluating how attractive someone is. Nothing like "okay I like them both, but I still prefer ________" here. If you already consider yourself this, then enjoy the free points!

:: Absolute Pregnancy Description

Absolutely any sex you have with another person will result in a viable pregnancy - even homosexual sex, so long as there's an available womb present in at least one of your bodies. No form of contraception or creative positioning (i.e. oral) can prevent this. Logic/fate will naturally prevent you from every having sex with anyone who has the Absolute Birth Control Curse, avoiding the whole unstoppable force/immovable object scenario.

:: Absolute Birth Control Description

Completely removes your ability to ever conceive a child with anyone else, as ither a mother or father. Cannot be taken with Absolute Pregnancy, Wacky Wombs, or Omnitool.

:: Wacky Wombs Description

Adds a functional womb+ovums to your body, connected to one of the following paths of your choice: your throat, urethra, anus, or side-by-side to an existing womb through a vaginal canal. Both male and females with this can be impregnated via penile penetration to the appropriate area. Your body will make the birthing process technically safe, but still probably pretty damn weird, kinda gross looking, and very painful. I guess that's pretty standard for pregnancy though? It won't get periods.

:: Omnitool Description

Causes pregancy to always be a possibility when your have sex, regardless of species differences, Children will be a mixture of the two species.

:: Gooey Description

Causes your entire body to be made out of sticky, slimy unicolor goo. All the body altering Curses you received/will receive will cause your goo to roughly mimic the shape and texture of that feature - goo pelt, gooey tail, and so on. This will probably look quite odd with many Curses. Your goo is slightly malleable, but will quickly revert to the form given to you by Curses - no shapeshifting. Your durability and dietary restrictions are unchanged. 

:: Rainbow Swirl Description

Permanently changes your skin and eye colors to significantly different, visually distinct colors of your choice. You can choose if you want to go with unusual colors like pink or red, or just stick with the normal human range.

:: Double Pepperoni Description

Swells up your nipples, making them rather puffy, and noticeably increases the area of your areolae. Also makes them a bit more sensitive. Cute!

:: Literal Blushing Virgin Description

Whenever you're having sex, you'll temporarily lose your memory of all your past sexual encounters, leading you to believe every time is your first. If you have one, you can also choose to regenerate your hymen to "complete the effect" if you like. It's not really an accurate indicator of virginity, so it doesn't matter either way.

:: Libido Reinforcement F Description

Gives one level of the Libido Reinforcement Curse. Please don't end up on any sexual offender lists!

:: Gender Reversal F Description

Gives one level of the Gender Reversal Curse, causing your body's apparent gender to gradually change. Do you like the way your body looks now?

:: Asset Robustness F Description

Grows your boobs by about 16 cup sizes and/or increases your penis size by about 40cm (16in), depending on what's applicable. We're well into territory that could be considered a medical condition, now.

:: Urine Reamplification B Description

Completely removes your ability to judge how full your bladder is, or hold it when it's full. Expect a lot of accidents, especially with Urine Reamplification A. Can be managed if you make using the restroom very frequently a habit, but be careful.

:: Eye on the Prize Description

Gouges out one of the two eyes you were born with. (This might sting a little... and then a lot, for a long time. The wound will be sealed to prevent infection.) @@.italic; This could have major effects on your journey.@@ Losing one eye, and with it depth perception, will make many basic tasks difficult, rendering you much less capable of dealing with Threats. Losing both eyes will render you incapable of much of anything down here on your own. Even with a companion, you should assume a great deal of lost travel time, as they will need to slow their pace greatly to assist you. Can be taken twice if you still have both organic eyes.

:: Deafening Silence Description

You will be rendered completely deaf, incapable of ever processing sound again. Potentially a very dangerous condition to have in the Abyss, reducing you ability to react to threats and making communication with companions more difficult.

You can get an extra +10 corruption if you allow your ears to be violently ripped off, then sealed to prevent infection - so long as you have no other Curses affecting the ears.

:: Taciturn Turnaround Description

Renders you completely mute, incapable of ever uttering a sound again. Will undoubtably cast troubles on your journey if you're with a companion.

You can get an extra +25 corruption by volunteering to have your tongue violently ripped out (and the wound magically sealed up), simultaneously removing your sense of taste, but you can't choose to do so if you took Lingual Leviathan.

:: Ampu-Q-tie Description

Rips off one of your four limbs, about halfway up from the knee or elbow. (It's okay if you want to scream from the pain. The wound will be sealed up safely.) Prevents organic replacements from ever working, but you can get prosthetic replacements. @@.italic;This will likely have major effects on your journey.@@ Expect your carrying capacity to be heavily impacted for any arms you've lost, and in the absence of an appropriate countermeasure, you can expect insurmountable increases in travel time costs for losing any legs, likely forcing you to just give up and accept your fate. If you have a companion carry you the probably won't be able to carry much of anything else, and will be moving much slower than they would otherwise... even without limbs, humans are heavy. Can only be taken for organic, intact limbs.

:: Nose Goes Description

Removes your sense of smell permanently. A relatively tame drawback that probably won't trouble you too much down here, but you'll miss out on the smells of freshly-cooked food, or of a flower garden on a balmy summer day, or of a refreshing salty ocean breeze... you'll probably miss them eventually.

:: Arm Army Description

Adds an extra arm of leg in roughly the same spot your normal ones are. If you prefer, you could also have additional legs turn you into a centaur. Either way, the extra limbs will probably get in the way quite a bit and require years of practice before you're half as good at using them as you were before. This may slow down your travels or lower your ability to defend yourself. Limbs can be succesfully amputated @@.italic;if@@ immediately replaced with prosthetics.

Cannot be taken with Ampu-Q-tie. (max. 6)

:: A Little Extra Description

Takes whetever sexual equipment you have between your legs and adds another copy of it down there. You can decide the exact configuration. If you have both a penis and a vagina, you may choose which gets copied.

:: Null Description

Completely removes your genitals. You'll just have a smooth patch of skin on your groin, like a doll. Any waste that would've exited through there will instead be heading out the back door. Also removes your nipples, again leaving a smooth patch of skin in their place. If any Curse has its effects entirely negated by this, you lose the corruption points it gave you. Some Curses could be altered a bit, like Leaky lubricating your back door, or having Asset Robustness Curses that previously affected a penis now apply to boobs, while others will be inevitably be lost. Naturally, cannot be taken with A Little Extra.

I hope you really like oral and/or anal!

:: Seafolk Description

In place of legs, you now have a finned tail, allowing you to quickly swim through water. It also grants you a pair of gills in the position of your choice, allowing you to breathe underwater with ease. @@.italic; This doesn't seem like a very practical appendage in the Abyss!@@ Expect all the same drawbacks you would see if you took Ampu-Q-tie for your legs, but even greater as you still have the weight of your legs, just none of the function. You can get an extra +10 corruption if you elect to have your lungs completely adapt to being underwater, unable to breathe air. (This would probably be a bad idea.)

Cannot be taken with Ampu-Q-tie directed at the legs - requires both legs to still be there. 

:: Taken for Granite Description

Whenever you orgasm, you'll temporarily be petrified, turned into a completely immobile stone. The first time you orgasm in a given day, you'll be unpetrified after 5 minutes, but this will @@.italic;double@@ with each additional orgasm you have, only resetting at midnight. If you're petrified when the clock hits midnight, you'll still have to wait out your current timer. You'll sense what's going on around you when you're petrified just as well as you would normally, but will appear to the rest to the rest of the world as a completely immobile statue. Physical damage done to your stone form will be healed when you reform, but mental damage won't.

If you're completely unable to orgasm due to the effects of Pleasure Respecification Curses, this will instead turn you to stone for a random 2 hour, non-sleeping period each day.

:: Double Trouble Description

You have a twin now! This requires some explanations.

They look near-identical to you, are near-identical genetically, and have all the same curses you've picked, but can optionally have the opposite genitals. The rest the world, including relatives and companions, will recall the both of you having always been twins, and having ventured down tino the Abyss together. @@.italic;They@@ will remember a history where they ventured down on their own (with any companions), and where @@.italic;you@@ appeared after they took this Curse. For all you know, they could be right! (You'll find all the items you remember carrying down here on the fround between the two of you.) They could theoretically choose different Curses than you do from here on, but they have very similar tastes to you, so the probably won't.

They'll need to eat too, so you should be @@.italic;doubling@@ the number of resources you consume each day. I really don't recommend trying to betray them or abuse them for gain, or trying to set them up as any kind of "dump stat character" - this is @@.italic;you@@ we're talking about here, kind of, so your odds with any scheme would be at most 50/50.

Mechanically, you can consider them as a second avatar of "you" for most purposses - for example, they offer no additional uses of the Gossamery Scales, Icon of Mercy will remove the same Curse from you both simultaneously, Ring of the Devourer will give absorbed powers to both of you, Relics will deduct from both of your corruptions regardless of who picks it up, and so on. They offer a potential gameplay benefit in splitting up, providing a hand in carrying things, or fighting, but no other intrinsic mechanical benefits.

You might be disinclined to trust them in light of some other features of this layer, but this one's not one of @@.italic;them@@ ;they're genuinely in the same boat as you. At least so long as they don't get captured by an Inanis Ego - their conversion conditions are the same as yours. 

:: Conjoined Description

Pick on of your hired companions, or your twin from the Double Trouble Curse if you took it. You and that person are now conjoined, either from the hip down, chest down, or simply being two heads sharing a body. Separation would be fatal for both of you even before considering Curse rebound effects. Your conjoined body will not have the "purity gene", and will slowly take on the effects of any Curses you have (though they will be less pronounced on the other person's half if they don't have those same Curses.)

You each control half of your shared body, and movement will be very difficult. Add 1 day to all travel times down here. If you're conjoined to a companion, any physical skills will probably be rendered useless by the fusion, and they'll prpbably be estremely freaked out, with morale at an all time low. If you're conjoined with your twin, they'll probably be cool with it, though. They're just as okay with it as you are.

@@.bold;This Curse and Double Trouble are unique in that they cannot be stored with Managed Misfortune, or removed, transferred or copied with any Wonders.@@
