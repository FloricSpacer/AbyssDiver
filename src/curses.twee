:: Libido Reinforcement Stage 1

You will feel hot and bothered far more regularly than you are accustomed to. Uncomfortable but manageable.

:: Libido Reinforcement Stage 2

Your sexual urges will become frequent and very difficult to resist. Can be only barely hidden: leading a normal lifestyle will be possible but frequently frustrating.

:: Libido Reinforcement Stage 3

At this point your libido will probably be considered a symptom of a mental disorder. You'll be hopelessly addicted to sex, and it will be impossible to keep your desires hidden.

:: Libido Reinforcement Stage 4

You will desire sex about as much as you desire basic necessities like food and water, perhaps slightly more. You'll go to great lengths for sex, and it will dominate your life.

:: Libido Reinforcement Stage 5

You will need sex almost constantly &mdash; having sex will only sate your hunger for it for a matter of minutes, and you will find little meaning in things that don't lead to you having more sex.

:: Libido Reinforcement Stage 6

//Receiving further Libido Reinforcements will quickly remove what little control you have left over your body, and erode your sense of self. I recommend not doing that!//

:: Gender MtF1

As the miasmal energy of the Curse cascades over you, an unexpected shudder races down your spine. It feels like an icy gust, chilling the very marrow in your bones. The sensation isn't painful, but it's distinctly alien, like something deep in your cells is being rewritten.

Looking down, you study your hands, battle-hardened and calloused from the grueling expedition into the Abyss. There's a subtle shift; your knuckles, once rugged and pronounced, seem softer. The skin stretched over them gains a hint of delicacy, a touch of refinement. The veins that once stood out, bold against your skin, now subtly fade, murmuring beneath the surface like a secret.

A thrum resonates through your muscles, a vibrational shift that sets your heart pounding against your ribcage. It feels as if your sinews are shifting beneath the skin in your chest. Your biceps, triceps, shoulders – they all seem to contract, their robust mass receding to reveal a more slender, elongated definition. There's not too much of a loss of strength, rather a redistribution, a balance between power and grace.

The Curse softens the structure of your face. Your jawline, once chiseled and prominent, smoothens into a gentler curve. Your cheekbones elevate subtly, crafting a more pronounced structure, while your eyes seem to gain depth, their expressiveness enhanced. The changes are minute, barely noticeable, yet undeniably present.

The scent of your skin shifts, the potent musk replaced with a lighter, sweeter aroma. It's neither floral nor fruity, but a softer variant of your own scent. Your body hair retreats, each strand becoming finer, sparser. Your skin, once rugged and resilient, now has a subtle sense of softness.

As you process these changes, you can't help but wonder about your future. Will the transformations halt here? Or will they persist, relentlessly morphing you until you're a stranger to yourself? 

:: Gender MtF2

A familiar cascade of cold, miasma energy washes through you. The Curse continues to shift your form into a more feminine one. Your arms, once bristling with solid muscles, now display slender, toned curves, echoing the lithe strength of a dancer.

Your torso experiences a slimming transformation, the broad expanse of your shoulders refining into a more streamlined silhouette. Your waist cinches subtly, crafting a gentle curve that seamlessly blends into your hips. The shift is gentle, but perceptible. You move with a newfound fluidity, each step, each gesture carrying an inherent, rhythmic grace.

The feminization of your facial features persists, yielding an almost sculptural beauty. Your lips seem fuller, tinged with a slight rosy hue, their cupid's bow more pronounced. Your eyelashes appear longer, their feathery fringe lending a hint of innocence to your gaze. Your eyebrows arch delicately, adding another layer of femininity to your countenance.

The texture of your hair transforms, each strand gaining a silk-like softness. The color remains consistent, yet there's a newfound depth, a vibrancy that was previously absent. It's as if the very core of you is being refined, filtered into this new form.

:: Gender MtF3

A familiar cascade of cold, miasma energy washes through you as your transformation continues, steadfast and insistent, sculpting you into a form that straddles the line between masculinity and femininity. Your body, once clearly masculine, is now a striking model of androgyny. Your shoulders retain their breadth but with a gentler slope, their hard edges softened into subtle curves. Your waist, sleek and streamlined, flows into your hips, which have broadened just enough to add a soft curvature to your figure.

Your body hair has receded dramatically, leaving your skin smooth and unblemished, without any of the roughness that would be expected of a typical man. The scent that emanates from you is intriguingly ambiguous, neither distinctly masculine nor feminine, but a harmonious blend that is as unique as your evolving form.

Your face hosts the most captivating changes. Your features are a medley of softened angles and gentle curves. Your lips, eyes, cheekbones; all of them exist beyond traditional binary definitions, giving you an ethereal, otherworldly allure.

Your voice is now a mellifluous harmony that flows like a smooth melody. It's not high-pitched but rather a softer tone that carries the strength of your past and the elegance of your present.

As you ponder the transformations, you can't help but question how this new form, this blend of masculine and feminine, would affect your interactions, your relationships, and your self-perception. Will you be ostracized or embraced?

:: Gender MtF4

A familiar cascade of cold, miasma energy washes through you as your transformation, as relentless as the flow of time, propels you deeper into the realm of femininity. Your body now exudes feminine allure, yet it retains an echo of your past strength. Your shoulders, once commanding with their breadth, are now softer, yet they still carry a sense of authority, a nod to your history.

Your waist is sculpted and narrow, leading to hips that are unquestionably feminine. Your legs, long and toned, display a harmonious balance of strength and grace. Your body, a fascinating blend of firm lines and gentle curves, makes you distinctively captivating.

Your face fully embraces the transformation. Your features are a blend of softness and strength, your eyes expressive, and your lips plump. High cheekbones, a delicate jawline, all contribute to a stunning blend of femininity and power. Your hair, now longer, softly frames your face, its gentle waves adding another layer of femininity.

Your voice settles into a rich contralto, a deep and resonant tone that seems to hum with the energy of the Abyss. It's a voice that demands attention, a voice that's as unique as your new form.

As the transformation presses on, you contemplate how this will change your life, your identity. You're no longer the man you were, but hints of your former masculinity remain. In some ways, you're a fusion, a unique blend of strength and grace. As the Abyss resonates with your transformation, you can't help but feel a sense of anticipation for the journey ahead.

:: Gender MtF5

As another wave of miasmal energy washes over you, your transformation concludes. You now undeniably look like a woman to any person who would see you. Your shoulders have taken on a soft, rounded silhouette, tapering down to a slender waist that smoothly merges into wide, curvaceous hips. Your legs, long and exquisitely shapely, are an ode to a subtle strength blended with graceful curves.

Your face is a study in feminine allure, your features refined and delicate. Your eyes, spirited and deep, shimmer with the same unyielding resolve and strength that have always been part of your core. Your lips, now plump and soft, are tinted with a natural blush, enhancing their inviting allure. Your hair cascades around your face and shoulders in a gentle torrent of soft waves, a silken frame that amplifies your femininity.

Your voice is now a melodious soprano, a tone that's soft and enchanting. It's a voice that, despite its gentleness, is still potent, an auditory reflection of your newly  feminine form. Meanwhile your skin, smooth and soft, is a satin texture that seems to exude an sort of inner glow, sort of like what you may have seen on skincare ads on the surface. 

As you take in your new form, questions about your future undoubtedly surface. How will this transformation impact your future? Will you be able to navigate the world as a woman? 

:: Gender FtM1

The bone-deep chill of the Abyss pierces your skin, yet this icy embrace is counteracted by an internal, enigmatic warmth. It starts as a soft, pulsating glow at your very core, then radiates outward, seeping into your extremities, fingers and toes alike. It feels akin to liquid sunlight coursing through your veins, a peculiarly energizing transformation that sets your heart aflutter, blending anticipation with a dash of trepidation.

Your hands, previously relatively soft and delicate, start to manifest a newfound robustness. You flex them, mesmerized by the sight of the sinewy tendons undulating beneath the skin. There's an unfamiliar hardness to them now, an intriguing resilience that marks the onset of your transformation. The muscles in your forearms respond, subtly bulging as your grip tightens, marking a slight but undeniable shift.

The transformative wave doesn't bypass your physique. The gentle curves that once adorned your figure begin to subtly realign, your waist losing its pronounced tapering. In exchange, your shoulders start broadening, paving the way for burgeoning muscles that ripple under the skin, sculpting a firm, athletic build. Your attire strains, stretched taut over the new muscle padding your body. You're still discernibly feminine, but a dash of ruggedness now punctuates your appearance, lending an intriguing, masculine edge.

Your voice, once a high, melodious symphony, descends a tone, morphing into a sultry, resonant timbre. The sound surprises you, a whispered homage to your past self, now layered with a velvety undertone that sends an unexpected shiver skittering down your spine. You catch your breath, a cascade of thoughts flooding your mind, all centered on the potential implications of this transformation.

This stage of your metamorphosis leaves you in a state of odd self-recognition – you're now a subtly masculine version of your former self. Amidst the subtle shifts in your physique and voice, you remain fundamentally you, but stronger and more formidable. 

:: Gender FtM2

A familiar wave of cold, miasmal energy engulfs you as the next level of the Curse takes hold. The tingling sensation reemerges, now paired with a deep, resonant hum that vibrates within your bones, infusing you with an energy that oscillates between the foreign and exhilarating.

Your body persists in its transformation, muscles carving out more defined silhouettes. Biceps, triceps, quadriceps – each hardens, the skin stretched over them taut and lean. The contours of your body sharpen, the former softness gradually usurped by a raw, primal strength. An unexpected satisfaction stirs within as you explore your new form, admiring the sturdy arms and the muscular strength pulsing in your legs.

Your face follows suit, your jawline subtly morphing, becoming more pronounced, more angular. There's a harder edge to your face now, a masculine sharpness that creates an arresting contrast with your lingering feminine features. You trace the line of your jaw, fascinated by the tangible change.

Your hair now shortens, while the strands thicken into a coarse texture. It's different, but not unattractive, adopting a rugged, masculine cut that compliments your evolving appearance. You find your fingers constantly ruffling through it, intrigued by the novelty of the sensation.

This stage of your transformation leaves you feeling like a masculine version of the woman you once were. You retain your feminine aspects, but they're offset by your increasingly masculine features.

:: Gender FtM3

As the third wave of cold, miasmal energy washes over you, the transformation is akin to finding yourself in the epicenter of a swirling hurricane. The energy coursing within you flares up, an incandescent beacon in the heart of the Abyss. It's no longer merely a tingling – it's a potent, malleable force that shapes and sculpts you from within.

Your features continue to transform, reaching a point of equilibrium where they're neither definitively feminine nor masculine. Your cheeks subtly chisel, your chin asserts itself, and your eyes, once wide and innocent, now hold a captivating depth, a mysterious intensity. The visage in the mirror is a captivating blend of familiarity and novelty – a seamless fusion of the woman you were and the man you're gradually embodying.

Your body follows suit, streamlining into a lean, firm silhouette. The vestiges of your feminine form, the soft curves, are now nearly erased, supplanted by the sleek lines of toned muscle and sinew. You feel lithe and agile, your movements fluid and confident. Your physique now displays an oddly harmonious symmetry, a balanced blend that feels oddly comforting.

The voice that unfurls from your lips is a sultry, husky blend of your past and emerging self. It's a voice that somehow exudes both strength and softness, a mirror of your current androgynous state. You experiment with its range, finding you have a surprisingly versatile dynamic range.

This stage of transformation leaves you feeling like a perfectly balanced mix of both genders.

:: Gender FtM4

The fourth transformational wave of cold energy engulfs you like a rhythmic dance, a synchronized ebb and flow that sweeps through you. This time, it's more gentle, a seductive waltz that nudges you further along the transformative path.

Your features continue their evolution, developing a more masculine demeanor. Yet, a hint of softness lingers, a touch of femininity that creates a fascinating contrast against your increasingly masculine canvas. Your jawline sharpens, your nose acquires a stronger profile, and the intensity in your eyes is complemented by a certain depth, a subtle nod to the woman you once were.

Your physique adopts an even more masculine form, muscles and sinew gaining prominence. Your shoulders widen, your chest flattens, and your waistline relinquishes the last echoes of its once-feminine curvature. Yet, your movements retain a certain grace, a finesse that whispers tales of your feminine past.

Your voice deepens further, settling into a rich baritone that sends resonant vibrations coursing through your being. It's a voice that carries an echo of your past, enveloped in the depths of the man you're evolving into. It's a voice versatile enough to whisper tender words or command unswerving attention.

The fourth stage of your transformation leaves you feeling akin to a feminine man.

:: Gender FtM5

The final, cold wave of transformation barrels into you like a tsunami, a relentless, all-encompassing force that steals your breath away. It surges through your veins, a cataclysm of energy that signifies the culmination of your physical transformation into a masculine form. It's a potent, overwhelming sensation, yet there's an unmistakable sense of resolution, a profound feeling of completeness.

Your features evolve into a rugged handsomeness, the last vestiges of your femininity dissolving into the striking masculinity now defining you. Your jawline is chiseled, your nose prominent, and your eyes hold a captivating depth that is undeniably magnetic. The man staring back at you from the mirror is a stark contrast to the woman you once were.

Your physique morphs into a robust and commanding masculine form, broad-shouldered and powerfully built. Your muscles ripple beneath your skin, a visual testament to your newfound strength. There's a palpable rawness to your form, a potent virility that imbues you with a sense of invincibility.

Your voice settles into a deep, resonant bass that reverberates through your body. It's a voice that effortlessly commands attention, a voice that exudes masculinity.

The final stage of your transformation leaves you feeling wholly masculine. Your body seems to have shed your previous feminine identity, leaving you looking as masculine as any man could be.

:: Libido Increase 1

The moment the Curse entwines with your essence, a wave of unexpected warmth cascades through your body. Like a whisper of a summer breeze that sends a shiver down your spine, it's an alien feeling, not entirely unpleasant but noticeable enough to make you uneasy. There's an almost tangible undercurrent of eroticism coursing through your veins, igniting a spark deep within you. It leaves you yearning, teasing your senses in a tantalizingly exotic manner.

Your heart pounds within your chest, a drumbeat of desire matching the rhythm of your newly awakened awareness. It's a strange rhythm, syncopated and sporadic, bringing a heightened awareness to places that usually remain quiet. Subtle stimuli seem amplified, your body reacting to every minute vibration of the Abyss around you. This disconcerting sensation makes you anxious, yet an undertow of exhilaration keeps you enthralled.

The back of your mind stirs with thoughts of how this might complicate your expedition, how the tiniest of distractions now seem alluring. Food, sleep, the task at hand—all feel somewhat tainted with an ambiguous touch of sensuality. It's discomforting yet not entirely unmanageable, as if you've stepped into a twilight zone where everything is painted with shades of desire.

Your focus is drawn towards an impending unease—the fear of the Abyss seeming almost inconsequential compared to the strange desires stirring within you. You find yourself questioning your priorities, wondering whether your exploration of the Abyss can compete with the exploration of your own burgeoning desires.

The Curse leaves you in a peculiar state of thought, thinking about how this odd fixation might shape your future. Could you navigate this Abyss while maintaining the sanity of your mind and the stability of your actions? It seems like a challenge you're not prepared for, and yet, it's one you have no choice but to accept.

:: Libido Increase 2

The Curse takes a firm grip, dragging you further into its sensual depths. Your libido flares, a wild, uncontrolled fire blazing within the confines of your body, radiating an insatiable yearning that shatters your veneer of restraint. Every nerve ending seems to be on high alert, reacting to unseen stimuli with an aching need that's impossible to ignore.

Resisting the urges becomes an exercise in futility, like trying to contain a storm in a bottle. It's a battle you're losing, each passing moment turning the tides more and more against you. Your thoughts stray, too often, to the carnal, pushing aside anything irrelevant to this omnipresent yearning. The previously thrilling exploration of the Abyss now feels frustratingly mundane, your mind involuntarily seeking the thrill of another kind of discovery.

Even as you traverse the enigmatic Abyss, you find yourself constantly aware of your own physicality. The raw, primal call of the Abyss seems to echo the yearning within your soul, magnifying the erotic impulses to an unbearable intensity.

The reality of your situation begins to dawn on you—it's not just about the journey anymore, but the way your own body is turning into an unknown territory. Your existence seems to be morphing into a battlefield where the lines between necessity and desire are blurring. It's a war you never prepared for, a war that you must face amidst the eerie allure of the Abyss.

Wondering how to maintain the facade of normalcy amidst this chaos becomes a concern. You find yourself questioning if you can survive this duality — conquering the Abyss while simultaneously wrestling with the incessant demands of your heightened libido. It's a predicament that feels as daunting as it is frustrating.

:: Libido Increase 3

The Curse worms itself into the very core of your being, turning your world into a relentless storm of desire. It's as if you're trapped in an erotic nightmare where your libido holds the reins, dictating your every thought and action. Your obsession with sex feels all-consuming, stripping away the layers of sanity you had desperately clung onto.

Every whisper of the Abyss, every echo that reverberates through the eerie silence, stirs something carnal within you. Your senses become finely tuned instruments of pleasure, each nerve aching to be satiated. The mere act of moving through the Abyss feels like a dance of seduction, your body responding with a yearning that borders on the pathological.

It's a craving that feels insurmountable, a hunger that gnaws at your sanity, leaving you in a state of perpetual longing. Nothing else matters as much as this burning need. The Abyss loses its appeal, turning into a mere backdrop to the erotic drama playing out within your own body.

The notion of discretion feels laughably obsolete. You're caught in a tidal wave of sexual urgency that washes away any pretense of control. It's a frightening realization—your addiction to sex has you ensnared, your desires laid bare to the unfathomable depths of the Abyss.

With a dread-filled heart, you contemplate the consequences of this insatiable desire. How would you maintain your purpose when your mind is endlessly besieged by these primal urges? The Abyss, with all its mysteries, seems insignificant compared to the tumultuous storm of sex raging within you.

:: Libido Increase 4

The Curse tightens its vice-like grip, pushing your libido to a feverish pitch. Your desire for sex becomes as crucial as the need for air, water, or sustenance. It's an obsession that borders on madness, each moment dragging you deeper into the throes of an all-encompassing carnal frenzy.

Every corner of the Abyss, every shadow, every peculiar noise seems to amplify your sexual hunger. It's as if your very soul resonates with a need so profound, so demanding, that it threatens to overthrow the remnants of your rationality. The depths of the Abyss no longer induce fear or wonder—they're merely a stage for your raging libido to play out its unrestrained act.

This desire dominates your existence, seizing control of your thoughts and actions. It's a throbbing undercurrent that turns every moment into a pursuit of pleasure. Everything becomes a tantalizing provocation, a cue to the relentless call of of lust playing in your head. The line between necessity and desire has not just blurred—it's obliterated, leaving you grappling with this relentless need.

The struggle to satiate your carnal urges takes precedence over everything else. It feels like a never-ending chase, a relentless pursuit that drives you to the edge of insanity. Your journey into the Abyss pales in comparison to the frenzied quest for pleasure that your life has become.

Even as you struggle to keep your urges in check, you can't help but fear the potential implications of this insatiable desire. How will you ever make sense of the Abyss when every thought, every sensation is overshadowed by this overpowering sexual hunger? It's a question that haunts your every waking moment, adding to the torment of the Curse.

:: Libido Increase 5

As the Curse further intensifies, your need for sex becomes a raging torrent, an insatiable beast that feeds on your every thought and action. Every moment feels like a battle between your sense of self and the insatiable hunger gnawing at your very core.

Even the briefest instances of satisfaction are fleeting, barely enough to quench the fiery thirst. Each act of sex is a mere drop in the ocean of desire that consumes you, leaving you craving for more almost instantly. Nothing seems to matter anymore, except for the constant pursuit of pleasure.

The Abyss loses its allure, turning into a mere background noise to the resounding chorus of your unfulfilled desires. It feels like you're living in a fever dream, one where your cravings dictate the course of your existence. The hunger is so overwhelming that it feels like a physical ache, one that you are unable to alleviate no matter how hard you try.

Your life becomes a series of fleeting moments of satisfaction interspersed with prolonged bouts of longing. It's a cycle of desire and fulfillment, but the fulfillment never lasts long enough. Each passing moment leaves you thirsting for more, the addiction proving stronger than any resolve or rationality you might have had.

You dread the future, as every part of your existence seems to be succumbing to this unrelenting desire. The thought of an expedition in the Abyss, combined with a never-ending pursuit of sex, fills you with a sense of despair. The Curse has turned your world upside down, replacing the thrill of discovery with the torment of an insatiable libido. But part of you doesn't even care anymore. After all, sex is the only thing that matters, right?

:: Libido Increase 6

Your life under the Curse reaches a new peak as your libido spirals out of control. Every thought, every breath, every beat of your heart is inundated with a ravenous hunger for sex. The line between your desires and your identity has blurred beyond recognition, merging into one relentless, unstoppable force.

The Abyss fades into insignificance as the relentless pursuit of sex takes center stage. It's as if your very existence is defined by this hunger that seems to grow with every passing moment. The once thrilling journey through the Abyss is now nothing more than a backdrop to the erotic dance your life has become.

The fight to control your urges becomes a lost cause, a battle you concede to the monstrous libido that now governs your life. The drive for sex becomes a constant companion, a tormenting echo that drowns out everything else. Your mind, body, and soul are held captive by the Curse, with no reprieve in sight.

Every moment becomes a struggle, a desperate chase for satisfaction that remains ever elusive. The hunger is unyielding, a tidal wave of desire that crashes over you, leaving you breathless and spent. Despite this, you are incapable of resisting, drawn irresistibly to the intoxicating allure of sexual gratification.

Your future seems like a desolate landscape, one where the joy of exploration and discovery has been replaced by an endless cycle of hunger and gratification. The Curse has stripped you of your original purpose, leaving you to wander aimlessly in the Abyss, a slave to your insatiable desires.

:: Libido Increase 7

The Curse completes its cruel transformation, your libido now defining your existence in its entirety. The concept of self, of identity, of purpose—all dissolve into the single-minded pursuit of sex. Your world is sex. Your life is sex. The Abyss, once a mysterious realm to explore, is now just a stage for your relentless carnal desires.

Your thoughts, your desires, your entire consciousness are suffused with an overwhelming desire for sex. The thirst for pleasure is unending, a maddening itch that demands to be scratched over and over again. It's an obsession that knows no bounds, a craving that eclipses everything else you once knew or cared about.

Your existence becomes nothing beyond your desire and fulfillment, a ceaseless cycle that feeds off your insatiable libido. Every corner of the Abyss, every sound, every sensation stokes the flames of your desire, sending you spiraling further into the throes of ecstasy. The Abyss fades away into a mere illusion, your world reduced to the pursuit of sexual pleasure.

There is no control, no semblance of restraint. You are a creature of desire, lost in a whirlwind of lust and craving. Your life, once marked by a quest for knowledge and discovery, is now wholly dedicated to the pursuit of carnal satisfaction. The Curse has completed its transformation, leaving you a slave to your libido.

The prospect of your future feels oddly insignificant. With your mind and body entirely consumed by sex, there's little room for anything else. The Abyss, your journey, your goals—all have faded into obscurity. The Curse has etched its final mark, forever altering the course of your destiny in the unfathomable depths of the Abyss.

	<<if $mc.libido === 3>>
		Sex. It's not quite a constant obsession for you, not yet, but you'd certainly like some right now... and a few more times a day. It just feels so good. This might be the Libido Reinforcement Curse that you took on talking, but seriously, orgasms add so much joy to life, and you'd just like to have more. It can change the way you look at others and yourself. Do others feel this need as much as you do? Probably not, since you remember not thinking about sex this much before you came to this Abyss. <br><br>Relax, now isn't the time for sex... even though you wish it were. <br><br>Surely there will be an opportunity soon? You hope so.
	<<elseif $mc.libido === 4>>
		You masturbated forty minutes ago, why are you thinking about sex again? Now that your libido has been greatly elevated, your desires are getting harder to control. You used to be intimidated by the idea of propositioning people for sex, but your need has suppressed that instinct as a simple matter of practicality. You realize you're becoming a bit of a slut, but what can you do? These Curses are just driving you into it. Despite how much of an issue it may be, you can't deny that a part of you is enjoying it.
	<<elseif $mc.libido === 5>>
		How many orgasms have you had in the past day? <br><br>You've lost count. It's all becoming a blur. Everything you see reminds you of sex. <br><br>Every person you see, no matter how unattractive they are, causes you to think about sexual interaction with them. When you look at animals, you're noticing their genitals, and wondering about them. Heck, you almost got off by grinding yourself into the dirt as you were "trying to go to sleep" last night. You might just have a problem. <br><br>No, it's not your fault, it's all these Libido Reinforcement Curses you've got! You try to calm down and take deep breaths, but then your arousal takes back control.
	<<elseif $mc.libido === 6>>
		You've accepted it at this point. You're the sluttiest slut you've ever heard of. You just can't stop yourself anymore. <br><br>Any sexual standards you once had have faded into mild preferences, but nothing can truly sate the need you feel. Whether you get back to the surface or stay down here, you're not going to be able to hold down any job except being a whore. But wow, you'd make a fantastic whore. <br><br>Every one of your orifices longs to be filled and each of your protrusions crave stimulation. If you can't find somebody else to help you, you'll do it to yourself, but you really want the company. You'd be happy having sex all day long, with only a few breaks. <br><br>Sometimes you worry that you're starting to lose track of your mission down here. Did you come down here into the Abyss just to fuck everyone and everything around you? No, but your original goals seem less important than they once did to you. Perhaps you can multitask and have sex while you're exploring? That sounds kind of awkward, but like it could be worth trying.
	<<elseif $mc.libido >= 7>>
		You're feeling less like a person and more like a set of warm body parts that crave sex. It's your true purpose, to fuck and get fucked as much as possible. <br><br>"No" screams a tiny voice in the back of your mind. "You're a person, you have dreams, you're more than just an animated sex doll." However, the need roars back even louder. Your rational mind tries to be optimistic. "Look," it says "this is manageable. When you get back to the surface, you can build a sex machine on wheels, and ride it around naked, and people who you pass can fuck you while you're going about our daily business. As long as you can keep your urges satisfied, you can live your life, and pursue your dreams." <br><br>Your dominant libido considers that and seems to assent, but that tiny bit of you that's still connected to non-sexual desires can't quite reconcile how that plan is going to work. Is there really any way you can possibly have enough sex to satisfy you without being detained as a public menace? Your primary fear is no longer dying down here, or being unable to get back, but just the fear of being deprived of erotic stimulation. <br><br>You don't just belong in a brothel, you belong in an unending orgy.

	<<if $mc.osex === "male">>
	<<if $mc.gender === 2>>
			Ever since you obtained the Gender Reversal Curse, you've started looking, and feeling, a bit more feminine. It's mostly subtle things, so you can mostly hide the changes if you want to. <br><br>Your body hair is a little less thick. Your facial hair isn't growing very much. Your voice is a little smoother and slightly higher. You're still a man, but your muscles are slightly less pronounced and you're giving off an aura that your masculinity is not something you've really cultivated. Overall though, it's still pretty easy to identify you as a man at a glance, albeit a feminine one.
	<<elseif $mc.gender === 3>>
			Your facial hair has stopped growing entirely. The hair on your chest doesn't seem to be growing either. Your shoulders have slimmed down and you've lost noticeable muscle mass. Another level of gender reversal has left you barely masculine at all. <br><br>Over the last week your adam's apple has shriveled away. Sometimes you go to say something and find your voice cracking, like when you were going through puberty, only you know it's not getting lower pitched, it's getting higher. In some environments you're certain that some guys with high masculinity and an ill temperament would pick on you. Even your hands have slimmed down and shrunk a little. <br><br>You're worried that at this point you're neither feminine nor masculine enough to be regarded as "sexy" by most people. Are you okay with that? If not, it might be easier to go forward with more Curses than trying to go backwards, since you can't override the Curse and ever be more masculine again anyway. Maybe you're thinking too much. When the choices are presented to you, you'll make them.
	<<elseif $mc.gender === 4>>
			Is anyone sure what your gender is? The other explorers who give you long glances trying to figure it out don't seem to have a clue. Do you even know? You're nearly perfectly androgynous, just slightly more feminine. Every bit of you from the top of your head to the tips of your toes could be either gender (excluding a few bits that you keep covered up). <br><br>Really though, you're not a man, and you're not a woman. You are neither and both. There's power in that. To walk the path between marks you apart. There are words for this in many languages, but is this what you want? In a way, you're beautiful, just not really in a way that would normally be thought of sexually. Do you see the rewards in this experience as being worth the burden, or will you continue the process of letting the Abyss change you?
	<<elseif $mc.gender === 5>>
			You've crossed the threshold. Your body looks female now. You think that when your hips widened and the way you walk changed it might have been the dividing line, but there are so many subtle changes that have happened to your body that you're really not sure. You're not sure how good you are at being female though. The Curse is giving you physical features, but it's not teaching you the secrets of womanhood in any way beyond your appearance. If you don't want to stand out as clueless and badly mannered, you're going to have to learn.
	<<elseif $mc.gender >= 6>>
			Your body has been completed changed by the continued erosion of your original masculinity. No one who casually looked at you would guess that you weren't born a woman, but sometimes it still feels strange. You're not as strong as you used to be and your flared hips and thighs certainly show off some of your new assets below the waist. Sometimes when you rub your face you still get the strange sensation that things aren't quite in the same place, but over time you're getting more and more used to your new reality with your distinctly feminine body.

	<<else>>
	<<if $mc.gender === 5>>
			Ever since you obtained the Gender Reversal Curse, you've lost a bit of "femininity" as some would describe it. You don't think you'll be wearing as many dresses or skirts from here on out, since it would just feel a bit awkward given your more aggressively hairy legs and changing figure. But you're taking a bit more joy in exploring the Abyss and you've gained a bit of muscle. Your voice is a tinge deeper, but more like a deep woman's voice, not a man's. 
	<<elseif $mc.gender === 4>>
			The hair on your arms and legs has started growing thicker, and you can't shave it off all the time or it grows back too quickly. You used to have noticeable hips, but they've started narrowing. It's definitely changed the way you walk, which was something you didn't expect, and now your gait is more masculine. Another level of gender reversal has made you downright mannish, for a woman at least. There's are faint wisps of hair that are appearing on other parts of your body that didn't have them before. <br><br>You're worried that at this point you're neither feminine nor masculine enough to be regarded as "sexy" by most people. Are you okay with that? If not, it might be easier to go forward with more Curses than trying to go backwards, since you can't override the Curse and ever be more feminine again anyway.

			You've crossed the threshold. Your body looks male now. You think that when your beard started growing it cemented that impression, but there are so many subtle changes that have happened to your body and mannerisms that you're really not sure. Your muscles aren't that pronounced for a man, but the layer of subdermal fat that women have is gone from your arms, so your muscles stand out more. You suppose the Curse must be messing with your hormone levels, but it's doing other things too. Still, it's given you the body of a man (even if not a very masculine one), but it hasn't taught you how to be a man. What does that even mean though? You feel some aggressive impulses that are more intense than what you are used to dealing with, but they aren't overpowering or anything like that. You're going to have to find a way to control those.
	<<elseif $mc.gender <= 1>>
			Your body has been completed changed by the continued erosion of your original femininity. No one who casually looked at you would guess that you weren't born a man, but sometimes it still feels strange. You're much stronger than you used to be and your solid musculature shows off your new assets in your arms. Sometimes when you rub your face you still get the strange sensation that things aren't quite in the same place, and occasionally scratching yourself on your stiff facial hair is something you'll need to get used to, but over time you're getting more and more used to your new reality with your distinctly masculine body.

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Clothing Restriction A">>
		No accessories for you. That's your reality after getting that Clothing Restriction Curse. <br><br>Your fashion options are a bit more limited now, but not being able to use any hats or scarves is legitimately inconvenient in some weather! Luckily, you've found that you're able to wear clothing with hoods attached, but as minor as this Curse is, you're going to notice it as an annoyance in your daily life.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Hair Removal">>
		You didn't think losing your body hair would have been such a big deal, but now every time you brush against something the sensation is more intense. Even in places you shaved, it feels different than before. Somehow, missing those little hairs that would grow in between shaving sessions gives your skin a significantly different feeling a lot of the time, more than you would have expected before. It almost feels as if you've lost a layer of protection from the world. Somehow, it seems like your interaction with the world and people around you has become more... intimate. 
	<</if>>	
	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Perma-dye">>
		Ha, you thought having $mc.hair hair wouldn't be such a big deal. But now you're beginning to realize it's affecting the way others see you, and the way you see yourself. When you see your reflection it makes it just a little bit harder to recognize yourself, it takes just a moment longer before you can tell that the person in the mirror is you. Despite being such a minor change, it still feels strange.
	<</if>>
	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Freckle Speckle">>
		With your skin now speckled with freckles, your appearance is much more unique. You chose where each freckle would appear, but you didn't exactly have a lot of time to really think about it or even a mirror to see what you'd look like! You hope that the next time you really get a good look at yourself you're happy with the choices you made. The Abyss is a strange place, but you're trying to make good choices while you're down here. That might get harder to do as the potential outcomes become harsher and harsher.
	<</if>>
	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Knife-ear">>
		When you were Cursed with knife-ears, you knew it would alter your appearance and the way other perceived you. But what you hadn't realized is just how sensitive the tips of your ears would become! Sometimes when you lay down your head on your pillow at night, if the angle is right, it feels almost sensual and you feel an urge to rub up against the pillow more. While it isn't too hard to control yourself, these new, pleasurable sensations are strange to deal with.
	<</if>>
	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Dizzying Heights">>
		You wince as you stub your toe, yet again. You're not quite used to your legs being this length, or really the new size of your whole body. With the Dizzying Heights Curse and what scavenging you've done, you're now <<BodyHeightText>> tall. You didn't think that would be such a big deal, but you'd gotten used to your body being a certain size, and a lot of the motions that you practiced many times before are just producing awkward results now! The whole world feels like it has changed in size, even though you know it's the same, it's only you that's changed.
	<</if>>
	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Increased Sensitivity">>
		A part of you knew that being Cursed with Increased Sensitivity would be a major change in erotic situations and it might not be the most convenient thing in everyday life. However, the tantalizing excitement drew you in, and now you're living with the consequences. You hadn't fully understood how the brush of cloth against your nipples and between your legs would draw shivers of desire out of you. You hadn't expected that you'd be splattering your juices simply by brushing against something at the right angle and position, but here you are, hot and panting simply because you brushed against a boulder the wrong way as you were moving past it.
	<</if>>
	<<if $foodL6 > 0>>
		About <<print 3 * $foodL6>> percent of your body has become a hyper sensitive erogenous zone. Merely touching it causes a disabling orgasm.
	<</if>>
	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Refractory Refactorization">>
		Getting rid of your refractory period? That's not so bad for a Curse, or so you'd thought. Then you found yourself in an erotic situation, and ended up cumming for seven minutes straight, not a moment's break in between. Your body was locked in spasms, and the experience was just so hot that you just kept on riding orgasm after orgasm in a continuous wave. Now however, you feel used up, worn out, desperately thirsty, and like your body pumped out something vital. Yet, your mind is abuzz with one of the most intense experiences of your life and you feel like you could go again at any moment.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Heat/Rut">>
		You frantically scan the Abyss around you. There must be someone or something else here that you can fuck. You let out a bestial growl that gradually becomes a simple whine of need. You used to think it was a little bit funny when animals went into heat or rut, but now that the Abyss has Cursed you with the same condition, you realize just how much being helplessly horny for long periods of time can warp your perspective. You've orgasmed multiple times in the past few hours, but the relief only lasts a few minutes before the need once again becomes all-consuming. It's a horniness that's relentless and unending, never giving you even a moment of respite. You've tried masturbating, but it's just not doing it for you. Not that fucking is giving you much relief either. <br><br>You want to scream. <br><br>Then you see somebody nearby. <br><br>Yes! You don't know who or what they are, but it doesn't even matter. You dash off towards them in complete desperation, so keyed up with arousal that you can't even think. Maybe tomorrow you'll remember this, with the haze of the Curse cleared.

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Sex Switcheroo">>
		<<if $mc.osex === "male">>
			When you were Cursed to replace you cock with a cunt, did you realize just how distracting it would be? Perhaps, but now you can't stop thinking about your new equipment. <br><br>Yet, it's more than equipment, isn't it? It's part of who you are now. How is this going to affect the rest of your life? <br><br>Sure, the enlightened say that it doesn't really matter, and to some random surface dweller that you past on the street, it probably shouldn't matter unless you plan to sleep with them. For you though, this is your body, and it matters quite a lot.

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Futa Fun">>
		Having both a penis and breasts comes with a different perspective. There are pleasures that are open to you that are closed to many others. However, as you encounter more of the Abyss, there's also a little trepidation that enters your mind of what else may change in the future. This place has a way of changing things, and you might have just opened a door for even more ways that it can change you. This Curse alone is a significant change, but are you prepared for what may follow if your body becomes even more corrupted?

		Your face burns a brilliant red. They're looking at you. They see you! This is so embarrassing! <br><br>"But it's also exciting" murmurs a different part of your mind. You find yourself agreeing, but that only makes you more embarrassed. Part of you knows that this is a result of the Blushing Virgin Curse, but you can't help the way you feel, or how your burning cheeks are only making you more aroused. You're so awkward, but that only adds a a novelty and vitality to the lewdness you engage in on a day to day basis.

Sometimes you're not sure what's best, even for yourself, so letting others take the lead makes total sense. <br><br>You want to be open to trying new things, and generally be a fun person to be around. However, there's little doubt in your mind that the Submissiveness Rectification Curse is amplifying this aspect of your personality somewhat, though you aren't quite sure how much. <br><br>Lately your dreams have been about getting tied up and letting strong dominant people do naughty things to you. Is this some idle fantasy, or a prediction for your future? The Curses in the Abyss can warp things in such strange ways that you're not sure.

			Oh gosh, you're perpetually naked now. No underwear, no clothes, no armor, just flashing everyone and everything all day long. If you're going to do anything but draw open-mouthed stares, you're going to have to get really good at using convincing body-paint, but even that won't work if anyone looks at you especially hard. Wherever you end up, this is going to have a big impact on your life. And there's no way to even unintentionally wear clothes, since the Curse makes them degrade immediately if you even attempt to get around it. <br><br>Maybe being naked isn't so bad, humans are the only creatures on the surface that wear clothes anyway. But when you think about everyone staring at your naked body, always, it conjures up a wild mix of emotions: embarrassment, fear, lust. If you live anywhere but a nudist colony, you're going to run afoul of a bunch of prudish people, or end up being followed by a bunch of horny people, let alone any laws you might be breaking!
		<<else>>
			Underwear is overrated, or at least that's what you'd been thinking when the Abyss bestowed this Clothing Restriction Curse on you. Your experience since then has slightly contradicted that. Your clothing really used to fit a lot better and stayed on more easily when the cloth of your undergarments was helping to hold it there. <br><br>Now you're worried that when you stretch awkwardly some of your clothes are just going to fall right off. Anyone looking on wouldn't just get a glimpse of your underwear, which before you'd have thought was embarrassing, they'd see your naked body. Going commando is generally thought of as pretty promiscuous behavior. Back on the surface, people are bound to notice that you're doing so eventually. If not from seeing a glimpse beneath your clothes, then surely someone will notice from the outline of your more sensitive parts if you happen to wear anything light during a hot summer day.

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Power Dom">>
		You just can't help yourself, you feel the need to try to dominate everything. You're not sure how the Power Dom Curse was able to warp your personality, how it embedded this irresistible compulsion into you, but it sure feels good when it works out. Dominating battles, dominating conversations, dominating someone sexually... you just can't help but try to do it whenever you get a chance. The problem comes when you aren't actually able to succeed in the attempt. Sometimes the dissatisfaction you feel makes you wonder if this Curse is turning you into a bad person. You don't want to be cruel or overbearing, you want to help, but you're having a much harder time dealing with any interaction where you're not on top. It just makes sense for you to be the one in charge! <br><br>You're worried about how many people are going to think you're a jerk, but if you're good enough, at leading, at giving pleasure, at talking, at fighting, at everything, then maybe a lot of people will really like who you've become. The prospect is daunting, but if you're going to insist on being in charge, don't you have the responsibility to make sure you at least do it well? The best way to get better is to practice. When you're the best no one can deny you your rightful place above them.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "20/20000000">>
		Who needs vision? Or that must have been what you were foolishly thinking when you were Cursed to see either a big dark blur or a big light blur when you don't have your glasses on. Sure, most of the time you have them on, but when they fall off, or you take them off to sleep, you can't help but realize just how vulnerable you are. All that someone with hostile intent would need to do is knock off your glasses, then you'd be totally unable to defend yourself without help. You're not sure whether you think wearing glasses improves your style, or whether your new vulnerability is just a little bit exciting, but your brain is telling you very sternly that trading your vision for a mere 20 corruption points was a not a very good trade after all.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Comic Relief">>
		AAAGGGHHHH! the Comic Relief Curse is driving you crazy. It interferes in your life constantly in subtle ways. When you're trying to say something you can feel it slightly changing the words that come out of your mouth to make everything sound like a sexual innuendo, leaving you to embarrassingly try to backpedal and only make it worse. People just happen to walk in on you at the most embarrassing moments. You sometimes trip and fall in the most embarrassing ways. Every time it happens, at the edge of your consciousness, you can feel the Curse just nudging the universe to make you the butt of a grand cosmic joke. <br><br>You'd try to explain it to other people, but you're sure that even if you made the attempt, the Curse would just make you sound ridiculous. Well, even if people are laughing at you and blushing about you, at least you bring a bit of entertainment to their lives. You could try to pursue a career as an off-the-wall comedian once you're done with this, everything you do is hilarious whether you want it to be or not, so maybe you could at least take advantage of the situation!
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Equal Opportunity">>
		Sexuality is complicated for many people, but less so for you now. The Equal Opportunity Curse has opened your eyes to just how sexy everyone can be, just how much pleasure you could get from every kind of person, even people you didn't find the least bit sexual before. Not everyone is going to be interested in that kind of interaction with you, but that's okay. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Whether you're getting pounded by a massive cock or fisting a vagina, your newfound liberation from previous narrow-minded ideas about sexuality has really opened the door to new varieties of pleasure and new people to connect with in that intimate way.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Absolute Pregnancy">>
		They say that our biology calls on us to reproduce. You're not so sure about that, but there is something entrancingly intimate about having a living thing growing inside you. During the act of sex, it's possible to experience that intimacy briefly, but in pregnancy, the intimacy stretches out, grows, and brings a new life into the world. Now that you've been Cursed with Absolute Pregnancy, you're going to be experiencing that deep sort of intimacy a lot more. You could try to be celibate, but you know that may not work out no mater how hard you try. <br><br>The certainty of getting pregnant from any sex means that you'll always live with pregnancy only a brief moment away. In a sense, it makes your sex feel much more intimate and the consequences much more real. Hopefully they're consequences that you'll be happy to live with.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Absolute Birth Control">>
		The thought of having children always frightened you. Whether it was the responsibility, the agonies, the commitment, or just losing your freedom, it just never appealed to you. It added a layer of hesitancy to your romantic life, it was a risk that could come up at any moment. <br><br>Now, because of the Absolute Birth Control Curse that is bound to you, you never have to worry about that again. You don't have to let that fear hold back your intimacy any longer. Maybe it's time to live a little, free of the worry of being tied down to a child. <br><br>A part of you is sad about never getting a chance to continue your family line personally, but if you really want children then adoption is always available!
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Wacky Wombs">>
		<<if $mc.extraWombs.length === 1>>
			You feel a twinge of sensation from the area of your $mc.extraWombs[0] and wonder if you're pregnant. Could any sperm have found their way into it? You picture yourself with that region of your body swelling with new life, your organs rearranging to make room for it, your balance shifting, and culminating in a messy and painful birth many months from now. Was adding a womb to your $mc.extraWombs[0] really a smart idea? Smart or not, you're stuck with it now. Even if you're not pregnant yet, and that twinge is just a result of the shifting internal folds of your new organs, the Abyss is a strange, perverse, and risky place. How long until someone or something compatible gets the better of you and you end up pregnant? Things are harder to predict down here, and sperm can get into the strangest places... and then start swimming.
		<<elseif $mc.extraWombs.length === 2>>
			You feel a twinge of sensation from two different spots near simultaneously. Your $mc.extraWombs[0] and $mc.extraWombs[1] both seem to clench in irritation and then relax. That's unnerving. You wonder, could you be pregnant in both of your added wombs? Could any sperm have found their way into those spots? You picture yourself with those regions of your body swelling with new life, your organs rearranging to make room for the pregnancies, your balance shifting, with it all culminating in messy and painful births many months from now. <br><br>Was adding two wombs to your $mc.extraWombs[0] and $mc.extraWombs[1] really a smart idea? Smart or not, you're stuck with it now. Even if you're not pregnant yet, and those twinges were just a result of the shifting internal folds of your new organs, the Abyss is a strange, perverse and risky place. How long until someone or something compatible gets the better of you and you end up pregnant? Things are harder to predict down here, and sperm can get into the strangest places... and then start swimming.
		<</if>>
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Omnitool">>
		Down here, in the Abyss, you've been exposed to many things that would be considered very strange back on the surface. Due to the Omnitool Curse, you can now even reproduce with other species. Do you want to? Will you have a choice? What lives will your offspring live? Will you end up staying down here with them, trying to bring them back to the surface? The social implications seem like they may outweigh the biological ones. Yet... you've heard about dragons that live down here...<br><br>You mind wanders and wanders, bouncing between the consequences of this Curse you've found yourself with. There don't seem to be any answers to many of these questions, and yet you can't keep yourself from asking them regardless. This Curse will certainly keep you awake late on many nights as you consider what the rest of your life may look like.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Gooey">>
		Gloop, gloop, squelch. <br><br>These are now the sounds you make while moving around. Taking the Gooey Curse has turned you into a creature much like the slimes you've heard about in stories and video games from the surface. It's a truly strange experience being so sticky and malleable, you have a hard time describing the sensations to anyone who can't experience it for themselves. <br><br>Dirt and rocks stick to your feet as you walk, and even slip a tiny bit inside you before the goo that makes up your body instinctively spits them out. Sometimes air gets caught up in your goo and makes funny bubbling noises at it pops back out. You're a bit more transparent than you used to be, and you have no idea how your organs work now, or if you even have proper organs at all. You can feel that everything inside of you is goo. And while you still have orifices, strangely, you no longer produce excrement. Everything you eat just turns into more goo, but you also shed little bits of goo as you brush against things occasionally. Sometimes when you touch things and your goo spreads out on the surface, you just kind of shlorp it all back up while you slowly pull away. Sometimes little bits of it remain behind, clinging to the surface with their stickiness. That's not gross, right? Maybe it would seem gross if it weren't your own body doing it. Perhaps you should ask for a second opinion? <br><br>Regardless, that is a distant thought for you because you figured out you can do something really really cool. Even if you stand still, you can manipulate your goo to slowly move you along a surface. You can do it standing up, just slowly gliding over the ground, you can do it lying down, you can do it while adopting all kinds of interesting postures. It's surprisingly fun! However, you can't use it to climb vertical surfaces or go upside-down. If you have hand-holds and foot-holds, you can climb just fine, but if you press yourself against a surface and try to move yourself up by your own stickiness, you start to go up, but then kind of just fold down in on yourself from gravity and flop into a deformed version of yourself on the ground and quickly squelch back into your proper shape. <br><br>You might be all goo, but the goo inside you is more sensitive than the goo outside of you, a lot more sensitive, as you've found from some cursory explorations of your body. This Curse has certainly radically changed the way you live your everyday life.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Rainbow Swirl">>
		Ah, colors. Your body is now a work of art. The Rainbow Swirl Curse allowed you to choose how to colorize yourself, sort of. It let you turn your skin and eyes into incredibly striking and intriguing colors and patterns, but it absolutely would not let you make yourself look like other humans. In some ways, this change is entirely superficial, but it's also an expression of who you are, or at least who you're becoming. From now on, you'll stand out, especially if you're showing much skin, and you won't be able to hide the fact you've been touched by the Abyss.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Double Pepperoni">>
		How much did you think about your nipples before you took the Double Pepperoni Curse? You're not entirely sure, but they're certainly a very notable part of your life now. They're just so big, and with so many nerves. When you get back to the surface, are you going to invest in a special bra to try to minimize the sensation, or maybe something to take advantage of it? You feel yourself growing aroused at the idea of somebody taking one of your engorged nipples into their mouth and starting to suck, maybe to gently nibble on it. No, no, no, you try to snap out of the distracting fantasy. You need to focus on surviving, not all the erotic things you want to do with very prominent and very sensitive nipples you've found yourself with.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Literal Blushing Virgin">>
		You're so nervous, but also really excited to finally lose your virginity. This is all new to you! To be this naked and vulnerable, moving against another person, your body being filled with strange sensations that are a little scary and wonderful at the same time. You don't really understand, but you're also feeling a strange sense of deja vu, like possibly you've done this before, except you haven't. You don't know what comes next. The confusion only heightens the intimacy, the sensations of skin on skin, sweat mingling in this kinetic experience, your body starts to tense up, and then a wave of sensation washes through your loins, flattening your thoughts, driving out everything else. As the moment ends, you shake your head to clear it. <br><br>Wait, you've done this before! Here you were being so passionate about losing your virginity, and it turns out that you're not even really a virgin? Oh dear. Then you remember the Literal Blushing Virgin Curse and sigh. Yeah, the Abyss did this to you. Now that all your experiences have come rushing back to you, you think about all the ways that you could have prolonged the contact, brought out even more ecstasy from the experience, except you couldn't have, because you couldn't remember. It seems you'll never learn to be any better of a lover than you are now. Still, the feeling of something new lingers. You might have had many first times, but you can never forget any of them. It's impossible to get jaded about something that's always new!
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Lactation Rejuvenation A" || $tempCurse.name === "Lactation Rejuvenation B">>
		Milk. You got a Curse that made you produce milk from your chest. It's not that big of a deal, right? <br><br>Sure, your breasts will gradually swell up, getting more sensitive as your milk ducts inflate, and to take care of yourself every several hours you need to stimulate your nipples sufficiently to initiate let down. It feels rather strange, slightly empowering, slightly erotic, but very wet and a bit sticky. <br><br>Maybe it is kind of a big deal after all. The biggest question is: what to do with all the milk? It's not that much, but it feels so wasteful to just let it fall on the ground. Should you maybe... share it with somebody? You're attempting to survive, and every drop of wasted milk is a drop of fluid and nutrients that you'll have to try to recover some other way. As you run your fingers over your nipples, preparing to milk yourself again, you lick your lips and think about how responsible it would be not to let it go to waste.

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Sleep Tight">>
		<<if $mc.hasCurse("Sweet Dreams")>>
			Sleep calls to you once again. Soon you'll enter your dreams, where you'll be in the hands of those odd things the Abyss has conjured up. They'll do things to you. They'll warp and change your body to their desires. You'll be helpless before them, but they will satisfy both themselves and you. Their teeth, their claws, their tentacles and slime, their enormous barbed penises that spear into you again and again, their vaginas that suck you in and hold you there while they vibrate around you with malicious mirth... <br><br>You are their plaything, but even if they sometimes hurt you, it always feels sublime, and it's only a dream. The only real thing about them is the orgasms they'll rip from your body as you cry out during your slumber... or perhaps they're not as imaginary as you think. The Abyss can perform apparent miracles after all. Are these creatures just in your imagination, or is it an intrusion into your mind by creatures of the Abyss? You're not sure. <br><br>Somehow though, no matter how wicked and perverse the things they do to you, you always end up longing for more. You lick your lips and shiver in a mix of anticipation and fear as you close your eyes, and let a new journey begin tonight.
		<<else>>
			Warmth, softness, comfort, letting your mind lazily drift through thoughts and dreams. That's what half of every day is like for you now. You don't remember it clearly most of the time, but it's so nice, and preferable to being awake most of the time. However, you are still getting a lot done in your waking hours. Razor focus often comes upon you, and you feel that your getting close to your purpose for coming down here. Then sleep begins to call you again. You understand why cats sleep so much now; it is glorious to those who can appreciate the peace it offers.

		<<else>>
			You try to keep going, you don't want those things to get you again. They lurk in your thoughts as sinister laughs and prideful snarls. The things they do to you when you fall asleep... Sleep.... You need to sleep. The last two days you've only gotten 4 hours a night, both nights you woke up screaming while also cumming all over yourself. The mix of terror and ecstasy left you confused and exhausted. <br><br>You don't want to be at the mercy of those things again, and yet... part of you is loving the things they do to you. You were Cursed with Sweet Dreams, that has to be what's causing your strange nightmares, but... you're too tired. They're just dreams. You're a person. People can adapt. Part of you expects that you'll find a way to deal with this new reality the Curse has bestowed on you. <br><br>In truth, more than half your fear is of your own adaptation. What kind of person will you have to become to sleep peacefully through the night? Probably one who enjoys and accepts all the strange and bizarre ways that the creatures in your nightmares milk orgasms from you. You can't keep your eyes open any longer, you're just too tired. Maybe this time won't be so bad.

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Crossdress Your Heart">>
		<<if $mc.sex==="male">>
			Skirts, dresses, and billowy blouses with ruffles and lace. Panties, bras, and not a single pair of pants in sight. That's what you feel most comfortable in right now, as embarrassing as it may be to be seen like that, in very feminine attire, that's what feels right. You can deviate from it a little bit, but deviate too much and before long the Crossdress Your Heart Curse starts taking a hold of you and pushing you in the right direction once again. Your penis feels quite strange wrapped in a lace thong as you move around in your light pink sundress. <br><br>You feel constricted, knowing that you're going to have to dress like this or similarly for the rest of your life, but somehow, you also feel free, beautiful; like you're trapped, but that it's wonderful at the same time. So much artistry and care went into these clothes, and at the center of them is you. It makes a warm little special feeling light up in your chest. Is it the Curse making you feel this way, or is this what you always wanted to be forced into?
		<<else>>
			Recently you've been completely unable to wear bras, and your chest hangs free, unsupported and sometimes leaving a nipple poking through your shirt. Power suits, muscle shirts, loose fitting pants and boxers are what you feel most comfortable in now that the Crossdress Your Heart Curse has taken a hold of you. If you go swimming, you know that you'll only be able to wear a pair of swim trunks, nothing covering your upper body. If you try to veer towards clothes that are gender-neutral, the Curse takes hold and picks the most masculine thing you can think of. <br><br>You can't even wear pants tailored for women! Wear a belt. In one sense, many women have been cross-dressing semi-frequently for a very long time. In another sense though, you're taking that practice far further than most would dare. You're worried that if you actually tried to wear something feminine that the Curse would somehow leave you topless, wearing only a loincloth, and dripping in sweat. You only feel comfortable when you're wearing dark colors in masculine styles. You'll need to be mindful of the other Curses you have. The larger your breasts are, the more you're going to stand out, as none of these clothes are tailored to accommodate them very well.
		<</if>>
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Lie Detector">>
		The Lie Detector Curse has really messed with your ability to communicate. You used to be able to be polite and say things that were nice, even if they weren't entirely true. Now your true thoughts always shine through your words. Other people don't seem to consciously understand that the Abyss has helped them see through you, they just have keen instinct into what you mean. There are times though that before you would have told a lie to people who had no business asking you something. You used to tell half-truths, carefully phrased so that deception may have been involved, but you weren't really lying. Doing that now just results badly. "What aren't you telling me?" is the most common response when you say a half-truth. For some things it might not matter, but for others it does. You're going to have to get better at saying nothing. The silver lining to all this is that trust is deeper. People might not understand why they trust you when you're honest, why they feel like they understand you better, but they do. You're wearing your heart on your sleeve, but you think your heart isn't so bad, and at least some people will have an easier time appreciating you for who you really are.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Megadontia">>
		Your teeth are so much more imposing with the Megadontia Curse's influence on you. They're fantastic for ripping into meat, for grabbing things, and for intimidation, but they're really not suited to chewing vegetables or even talking without a slightly strange new accent. You've had to adjust the way you move your tongue in your mouth to avoid getting it caught on all these sharp teeth, and while you can definitely talk, but your voice just sounds... different. The way you pronounce things has changed, and your smiles are positively crocodilian. Almost all animals react to the sight of your many teeth that are so large and so sharp. Did you realize you would look like a natural carnivore when you took this Curse?
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Lingual Leviathan">>
		Tongues are absolutely amazing. They're incredibly strong, ridiculously flexible, they heal quickly, and they're covered in sensitive taste buds. But your tongue though goes a bit overboard. When you extend it, it has 30 cm of controllable, prehensile reach. Because you're creative, you understand just how awesome this can be, however, the downsides are pretty obvious too. Talking normally has gotten a little trickier, since you just have so much tongue in your mouth! <br><br>You are also struck with an observation you'd never realized before: many of the animals with truly glorious tongues, like frogs, have lost their teeth. If your tongue is good enough, teeth sort of only become a hindrance and liability. Maybe the Abyss will offer you some way to replace yours with smooth ridges of bone... which would be very weird, but perhaps more practical. This much tongue though, it wants to be doing something. Just having it cramped up in your mouth all the time makes you restless. Perhaps you can put it to use on yourself or someone else who may want some oral attention.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Tipping the Scales">>
		You stretch out on a rock, and see the faint iridescence of your $tempCurse.scaleColor scales. It's a big change from what your skin used to be like, and is a mark that some parts of your physical humanity have been consumed by the Abyss. There's no point mourning what is gone though, and your scales are magnificent. They make you feel tough and confident, plus they look quite attractive to anyone who is inclined towards them. They're only on the outside though, and the skin inside you is not armored like your exterior. The contrast draws even more of your focus onto anything that manages to get past your scaly armor.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Reptail">>
		Your large, scaly tail drags on the ground behind you. You could hold it upright, but at the moment you're trying to look around, and it's much easier this way rather than needing to put the effort into holding it up. If you want to keep it above the ground, it's almost like standing on your tiptoes for long periods of time. <br><br>You also hadn't anticipated just how much the Reptail Curse would alter your center of balance! Your tail is marvelous, powerful, strong, delightfully armored in elegant scales, but it actually is pretty heavy with its thick and muscular shape. When the Abyss bestowed the Curse on you, there were some other subtle things that you felt changing in your backbone and pelvis. Your body rearranged itself to be able to cope with such a large addition, but when walking on two legs it means you need to lean forward much more to maintain your balance, but less so when you let your tail drag. This tail is going to come in handy for self-defense, and it's going to be amazing for swimming, but sometimes it can also be cumbersome and get in the way. Part of you thinks about how far forward you're frequently leaning, and how close your arms are to the ground, and wonders if it wouldn't be more practical to start using your hands to help you move forward, scurrying around like a lizard.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Cold Blooded">>
		Cold isn't painful, it isn't stressful, but a little bit makes you feel very lethargic, and a lot makes you fall into a peaceful, sleep-like state. Even your thoughts slow down in the cold. Ever since you obtained the Cold Blooded Curse your metabolism has been wildly different. Now that your body isn't wasting so much of the energy you get from food on making heat, you've theoretically got a lot more energy for other stuff and when you're warm you feel so powerful! You can run around, lunge with enormous force, and you feel like as long as you can get enough oxygen to your muscles you can just keep going. <br><br>In the cold though... well, sometimes it's nice and relaxing to be slow, sometimes it can help you rest, but if you even want to think clearly you have to drag yourself somewhere warmer. If you end up staying down here in the Abyss, you're going to want to take this into account. Some layers are going to be much more hospitable to you, while others are just going to be miserable.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Pleasure Respecification A">>
		<<if $mc.hasCurse("Pleasure Respecification B")>>
			Your ragged breathing is a sign of what the Abyss has done to you. You're so horny right now that you can't think. Every time you try to get yourself off, you get so close, so tantalizingly close, but you're never quite able to achieve orgasm. Every time you're fucking somebody else, the same thing happens. The feeling of need just keeps building, but there's never any relief. You calm down a little, but has anyone ever been this sexually frustrated? <br><br>The terrible truth is dawning on you. Only the Abyss can give you what you need. There are Curses that force you to have an orgasm, that circumvent all other rules and logic. Curses that will give you what you need. That's your only salvation now. Seek out those Curses and achieve release through the twisted and perverse whims of the Abyss. It's either that or stay this desperately horny and frustrated for the rest of your life.
		<<else>>
			Touching yourself feels amazing, but the pleasurable haze that clouds your mind only culminates in release when you're being touched by someone else... or fucking them. It's incredibly frustrating. The Abyss has done so many things to tempt you down the path of sex addiction, but with all of that, now you can't even obtain temporary relief on your own. You "need" to be with somebody else, or tat least hat's how you feel right now. The intensity of carnal relations with another person has only grown now that it's your only source of release. You need to be pressed against them, cumming your brains out. Nothing else will satisfy you, and you're just so horny!

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Clothing Restriction C">>
		<<if $mc.hasCurse("Clothing Restriction B")>>
			Oh gosh, you're perpetually naked now. No underwear, no clothes, no armor, just flashing everyone and everything all day long. If you're going to do anything but draw open-mouthed stares, you're going to have to get really good at using convincing body-paint, but even that won't work if anyone looks at you especially hard. Wherever you end up, this is going to have a big impact on your life. And there's no way to even unintentionally wear clothes, since the Curse makes them degrade immediately if you even attempt to get around it. <br><br>Maybe being naked isn't so bad, humans are the only creatures on the surface that wear clothes anyway. But when you think about everyone staring at your naked body, always, it conjures up a wild mix of emotions: embarrassment, fear, lust. If you live anywhere but a nudist colony, you're going to run afoul of a bunch of prudish people, or end up being followed by a bunch of horny people, let alone any laws you might be breaking!
		<<else>>
			Underwear is as much as you can ever wear now. You have a deep feeling in your gut that if you even tried to put on a swimsuit, the Curse you took would prevent it. No, your underwear needs to really be underwear, and everyone is able to see it all the time. How many situations is that going to be appropriate in? You can think of very few that aren't supposed to be intimate or private. <br><br>As you explore another layer of the Abyss, you look down at your underwear and feel very vulnerable. In this context, you look like you're either soliciting sexual interactions, or like you lost your clothes and are in a desperate situation. You're not sure which one is worse.

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Massacre Manicure">>
		Your claws are magnificent, but aside from dishing out painful slashes and catching things, they're not especially practical. In some situations they can help with climbing, but only if they can dig into the surface and find a hold. There are many tasks that have become more difficult, including social interactions. Unsurprisngly, many react with a bit more trepidation to a hand covered in claws. <br><br>There are things you could do to hide them, but some of them make you instinctively fearful of the possibility of one of your claws getting stuck. You've already experienced that once and it was agonizing as you dug your claw out. And regardless, it's not like the Abyss lets you hide the effects of a Curse for long. <br><br>There are a number of small ways that these are going to change your habits, but when you were Cursed with these calws you knew there would be consequences. All things considered, you can deal with this, but it's one more way the Abyss has changed you. You sure hope the Relics are worth it.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "S">>
		Sadism. <br><br>One of the cardinal vices. An attribute that has driven countless individuals into unspeakably evil acts. Yet, you are now one of the most adamant followers of sadistic pleasure. What does that say about you? <br><br>Yesterday you nearly had an orgasm from violently squashing a bug. Sex is just going to be boring if you're not making someone else feel pain. True masochists might enjoy the experience with you, but you're now too extreme for nearly anyone else to have a good time succumbing to your cruelty. Hunting has become an erotic sport for you, but any decent hunter would be appalled when you fail to stop yourself once you get your hands on the prey. The pleasure that suffuses your mind and body just feels so good. Are you turning into some kind of monster?
	<</if>>
	<<if $tempCurse.name === "M">>
		Masochism. <br><br>Oh, why do you feel this way? The Curse, you suppose. It's so wrong, but you struggle to stop yourself now. <br><br>You're poking yourself just to feel better. When you get back to the surface, you're dreaming of covering your body in tattoos and piercing absolutely everywhere. Not so much because you want that appearance, but when you imagine the pain of a needle piercing your skin, you can hardly stop yourself from getting excited. When you think erotic thoughts, you think of being whipped, of hot wax dripping onto your skin, of being fucked so hard that you scream out from it. <br><br>This isn't healthy, but as you withdraw a fingernail from an indentation it was making on your arm you still find yourself wanting more. You restrain yourself for now. Wait, is the absence of pleasure sufficient pain that it will cause some kind of pleasure of its own? That paradox scrambles your brain for a bit. Are nuns and monks secretly masochistic perverts who get off on their own self-denial? That thought seems rather taboo and a little unlikely, but it also opens up a little window for another path you could walk to extract some positive feelings from what this Curse has done to you.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Hijinks Ensue" && $currentLayer <= 5>>
		You're not sure if the Abyss hates you, or if it's just trying to turn you into a naughty slut, but the Hijinks Ensue Curse has certainly gotten you into quite a few embarrassing situations. There was that guy you were walking past on the trail, when you tripped on a rock that hadn't been there a second before, and you flung out your arms for support, but the only thing they encountered were his pants! Somehow, his pants came unbuckled as if his belt wasn't even there, his pants and underwear slid down as you crashed into him, and you face-planted into his crotch with his improbably erect penis in your MOUTH! <br><br>You must have looked like some super-slutty ninja pulling that off, except you were just trying to walk down the trail! Then there was the tree-branch incident... actually, you don't want to think about that, it was just too embarrassing. Somehow, you think the Curse is helping you get out of some of the consequences, nudging things into not being dangerous or detrimental in the long term, except for the embarrassment, and the damage to your reputation.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Flower Power">>
		Having leaves and flowers for hair is actually pretty nice, except for the occasional bugs it attracts. You used to feel when something brushed against your hair by the nerves in your scalp, but hair is mostly dead cells, and your new floral coating is very much alive. Now, you can notice any time something brushes against your much more sensitive hair, and haircuts may not be the most pleasant experience, as you feel a pinch any time you break off one of your hairs. <br><br>The flowers might have been a bad idea. You always thought of them as pleasant, but you hadn't thought about how they're essentially plant sex organs waving around inviting every pollinator in the world to interact with them. You suspect that plants experience the process a bit differently from you, but when a bee is rustling against your stamens and drinking your nectar, it feels like a toned down version of sexual activity, only it's on your head. You also caught a caterpillar munching on the leaves on the back of your head. It was only briefly, and you experienced it more as discomfort than pain, but the indignity of it all. How dare that caterpillar presume so much as to munch on you! <br><br>Still, the gentle breeze beneath your leaves and flowers makes everything more relaxing. It's going to be a lot harder to live normally back on the surface like this, but overall you are enjoying the Flower Power Curse.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Cellulose">>
		If only the Cellulose Curse had included a bit more lignin, the compound that makes plants more stiff and strong, and a little less cellulose. If your skin was made of lignin you'd be more like a dryad, and dryads are awesome. They're so tough and hardly anyone would be stupid enough to try to fight a lignin-hardened dryad. <br><br>You though, your skin is made of cellulose, it's more supple, a bit more delicate, and while it's kind of nifty, you're pretty terrified of how flammable you are now. Still, your new skin isn't all bad. If you had to blend in with a bunch of foliage, you'd have much more success, without even needing to paint yourself in camo. <br><br>However, going back to the surface is going to be much more socially difficult now. The change might be superficial, but people are often focused on the superficial and other creatures are even starting to treat you more like you were a plant. You think that carnivores might ignore you, but you've suddenly realized that things like termites, giraffes, and even cows, are going to look at you like a buffet. You never thought you'd be afraid of a cow.... but some instinct of self-preservation is warning you that you shouldn't get too close to them.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Chlorophyll">>
		As the miasmal light shines against your skin, you feel rejuvenated. The Chlorophyll Curse changed you in some pretty fundamental ways. You now have chloroplasts within your cells, like a plant. Some biologist would surely love to examine what happened more closely, but this is just who you are now. <<if $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.id === setup.companionIds.saeko)>>Perhaps Saeko may want to examine you? She doesn't have her equipment, but you've noticed she has been looking at your more closely since your change. <</if>>Your skin has taken on a greenish hue. Even your dreams are filled with visions of standing naked in sunny fields as a gentle wind rustles the grasses at your feet. <br><br>As long as you have light, water, and air, you feel profound peace suffusing you. The people and animals you once found so normal now seem just a bit strange to you. They just seem so agitated as they buzz about. You can still act like them, but there's now a part of you that asks if it wouldn't be nicer to slow down and bask in the light.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Pheromones">>
		Is that love in the air? Perhaps, or maybe it's just the aromatic cloud of pheromones that you have streaming out of you thanks to the Curse the Abyss bestowed on you. It's a very subtle change, except when it's not so subtle. You definitely could use this to your advantage if you wanted to, but your inability to turn it off also makes it a pretty clumsy tool for manipulation. <br><br>It's great if what you want is to have better sex, or take advantage of people, or be in the middle of a giant orgy. But if you want to be part of a group working on some task, you're going to need to stand downwind of everyone else, lest their bodies start distracting them from the task at hand. You'll have to test that, blowing your pheromones around. Are they magical in themselves, or has the Curse just made you produce more of something you were already producing?
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Carapacian">>
		Your exoskeleton is just so cool. It's like being encased in shiny hardened latex in some ways. It protects you, but it doesn't really dull the sensations you experience. You feel... snug inside your new chitinous armor. You can still feel everything you brush against, indeed, it's almost like your nerves have compensated, and the sensations are even more acute. They just don't hurt unless something could pierce your outer layers. And there are other sensations, more internal. You feel... a bit squishier inside. You don't know what that means, but it feels fine, so you're going to just roll with it.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Hemospectrum">>
		Changing the color of your blood for 35 free corruption points? What an easy decisions. Now though, as you look at that small scrape you got earlier, and see the $tempCurse.bloodColor blood that has dried into a scab, you can't help but think about how this marks you as very different to any other human who sees you bleed. <br><br>It's subtly changed the coloring in your eyes, of the veins beneath your skin, you feel... less human. If they see you bleed, won't other humans see you as less human too? They might be afraid of you. Frequently people fear what they don't understand, right? When you set off into the Abyss, you knew you'd be changed, but these subtle reminders about how you keep changing are warping your identity. What are you now?
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Wriggly Antennae">>
		Your antennae might shock and initially creep out many people, but they also definitely boost your senses. Subtle changes in the air stand out to you in ways you never noticed before. They respond to your thoughts, but you're not very good at controlling them yet. Their sensitivity affects you in one way you hadn't expected though. Gently rubbing them arouses you, awakening a deep warmth within you and a desire for someone else to touch them. You don't know what's going on in your brain, or why your body is responding this way, but you get the feeling that sufficient stimulation of your antennae might just send you over the edge. It's a bit of an awkward realization.
	<</if>>
/*
	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Eggxellent">>
		Your eggs. <br><br>You hadn't really understood what laying eggs would be like before you obtained the Eggxellent Curse, but now... well, it's an intense experience. Not quite painful, but they are large enough where the sensation borders on pain. As you look down at the small pile of eggs that just came out of you, you realize this is a bigger change to your life than you'd anticipated. As you recover, the memory of how those large, smooth, slippery eggs felt as they came out of you clings in your mind. <br><br>Not just any eggs though, your eggs.
	<</if>>
*/
	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Pleasure Respecification B">>
		<<if $mc.hasCurse("Pleasure Respecification A")>>
			Your ragged breathing is a sign of what the Abyss has done to you. You're so horny right now that you can't think. Every time you try to get yourself off, you get so close, so tantalizingly close, but you're never quite able to achieve orgasm. Every time you're fucking somebody else, the same thing happens. The feeling of need just keeps building, but there's never any relief. You calm down a little, but has anyone ever been this sexually frustrated? <br><br>The terrible truth is dawning on you. Only the Abyss can give you what you need. There are Curses that force you to have an orgasm, that circumvent all other rules and logic. Curses that will give you what you need. That's your only salvation now. Seek out those Curses and achieve release through the twisted and perverse whims of the Abyss. It's either that or stay this desperately horny and frustrated for the rest of your life.
		<<else>>
			Getting fucked feels amazing, but the pleasurable haze that clouds your mind only culminates in release when you're the one touching yourself. It's frustrating and a bit embarrassing when you can't finish with another person. In so many cultures masturbation is taboo, and while you're not ashamed of doing it, the fact that it's the only way you can get off now makes your cheeks burn hot. The Abyss has done so many things to tempt you down the path of sex addiction, but with all of that, now you can't even properly enjoy sex! When the Abyss bestowed the Pleasure Respecification B Curse on you, the Abyss was asking you "Hey, do you want to go fuck yourself?" and you responded with "oh yes, I want to be fucking myself all the time". Somehow, that thought has become more erotic than it once would have been. Tonight you'll slink off and masturbate alone, and it will feel so, so good.
		<</if>>
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Horny">>
		<<switch $hornVariation>>
			<<case "demonic">>
				You always wondered why all the depictions of incubi and succubi that you'd seen just has them standing around looking pretty or using magic, or fighting like humans with extra agility. They always have those horns on their heads, but they never seem to use them like horns are supposed to be used, for goring or ramming. Well, now that you have your own thanks to the Horny Curse, you understand. <<Numerical $hornCount "It's" "They're">> not meant for fighting. <<Numerical $hornCount "It's" "They're">> essentially <<Numerical $hornCount "an">> extra sexual organ<<PluralS $hornCount>> that <<Numerical $hornCount "is" "are">> sprouting out of your head. <br><br>You're pretty happy with how yours look, but you have to admit that aside from being a bold fashion choice, <<Numerical $hornCount "this horn is" "these horns are">> simply a liability. Maybe true incubi or succubi could draw sexual energy through <<Numerical $hornCount "it" "them">> or something similar, but for you, twirling your fingers around the <<Numerical $hornCount "tip of it" "tips of them">> is enough to bring you to orgasm, and the same is true if you rub the shaft<<PluralS $hornCount>> enough. The thought of ramming <<Numerical $hornCount "it" "them">> into anything though... well that's too painful to consider. When you smacked <<Numerical $hornCount "it" "them">> into a low hanging branch it briefly left you curled into a ball from the pain. Your new distinctive appearance is almost secondary to the sensitivity of your new appendage<<PluralS $hornCount>>. It's a lot to take in, but maybe you'll get more used to it over time.
			<<case "draconic">>
				The horns on fearsome dragons always struck you as a mark of power nobility and dominance. Well, now that you have your own thanks to the Horny Curse. You look awesome, but unfortunately the addition to your head is actually feeling more like a vulnerability than a weapon. You're pretty sure that the horns on real dragons aren't so tender. Yours <<Numerical $hornCount "acts more like a handle than a weapon" "act more like handles than weapons">>. <br><br><<Numerical $hornCount "It's" "They're">> somewhat sharp, but the muscles in your neck aren't strong enough to actually wield <<Numerical $hornCount "it" "them">> effectively, and oh <<Numerical $hornCount "it's" "they're">> so tender. Anyone who had the will to just grab hold of your horn<<PluralS $hornCount>> and hold on would certainly be able to immobilize you, and guide your head wherever they pleased. The thought of people and not-people manipulating you through your dragon horn<<PluralS $hornCount>> is so humiliating.
			<<case "unicorn">>
				Unicorns are so elegant, so majestic, radiating power, grace, and beauty. You thought that if you had <<Numerical $hornCount "a unicorn horn" "unicorn horns">>, you'd be amazing too. The Horny Curse doesn't seem to have worked out quite as you planned though. The unicorn horn<<PluralS $hornCount>> that now sprout<<Numerical $hornCount "s">> from your head <<Numerical $hornCount "is" "are">> charming and beautiful, but <<Numerical $hornCount "it's" "they've">> made you less graceful and more vulnerable. You feel a little silly. I mean honestly, why wouldn't <<Numerical $hornCount "a">> half-meter long horn<<PluralS $hornCount>> jutting out of your forehead throw you off balance and get caught on things? <br><br>You're also concerned that your unicorn horn<<PluralS $hornCount>> <<Numerical $hornCount "is" "are">> somehow corrupted. Whenever something touches <<Numerical $hornCount "it" "them">>, the sensations that run straight down the horn<<PluralS $hornCount>> and into your brain are overwhelming, and highly arousing. Even the thought of someone grabbing hold of your horn<<PluralS $hornCount>> and gently tracing their fingers through the spiraling grooves on <<Numerical $hornCount "it" "them">> is leaving you keyed up and panting. Are unicorns supposed to be hyper-sexual creatures stumbling around with poor balance? You're pretty sure they're not, but alas, that's what the Abyss has made you into.
			<<case "rhino">>
				Rhinos are symbols of strength, fortitude, and virility. Their solid bodies and tough skin all culminate around their magnificent horns. You somehow assumed that getting <<Numerical $hornCount "a">> rhino horn<<PluralS $hornCount>> of your own would make you tougher, stronger, and more imposing. It seems you were somewhat mistaken. The rhino horn<<PluralS $hornCount>> that now jut<<Numerical $hornCount "s">> out of your forehead <<Numerical $hornCount "is" "are">> certainly imposing, but any impression of added strength that <<Numerical $hornCount "it" "they">> give<<Numerical $hornCount "s">> you is entirely superficial. Real rhino horns aren't highly sensitive. Real rhino horns can't be used to control the creature that they're coming out of, but yours <<Numerical $hornCount "is" "are">> so tender, and so arousing to the touch, that you're pretty sure somebody who grabbed <<Numerical $hornCount "it" "them">> could get you to do whatever they wanted, guiding your head around wherever they pleased. <br><br>You've heard the phrase "grab the bull by the horns" as a phrase to mean confronting a difficult problem directly, but bulls are weak compared to rhinos. "Grab the rhino by the horn<<PluralS $hornCount>>" should mean to engage in extreme folly, but if anyone ever grabbed your rhino horn, you'd wilt under the pressure of their grip constricting around <<Numerical $hornCount "its" "their">> smoothness. You blush with embarrassment. You might have what appears to be <<Numerical $hornCount "a">> rhino's horn<<PluralS $hornCount>>, but you're certainly no rhino.
		<</switch>>
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Drawing Spades">>
		Your spade-tipped demon tail is just so naughty. You can feel the sensations from it, but it really has a mind of its own. You once came across a rabbit that had just reached sexual maturity, and it tried to have sex with absolutely everything around it. You're wondering if your tail has a similar spirit. It wraps around other people, especially any you find attractive, and it finds its way into their clothing if you don't pay attention and consciously hold it back. When you're alone, it tries to do the same to you. <br><br>If you really focus, you can control it, but it's easy to get distracted and then it once again tries to stimulate you. It seems to cooperate when you're in need of navigating obstacles or dealing with danger, but the rest of the time it seems focused on how it can make the most mischief, generally of the sexual variety. It's really annoying! But some part of you wonders whether it's only responding to what you subconsciously desire.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Tattoo Tally">>
		You feel a mix of embarrassment, shame, and pride as you look at the ornate Tattoo Tally that's permanently inked into your abdomen. It's not the only tattoo left by the Curse, and it's the one that's easiest for you to cover up, but when you look at it, the details of every lewd thing you've ever done or experienced jump into your mind. The people and beings that glimpse your tattoos stare at you. Their expressions take on various shades of hunger, wide-eyed lust, disgust, and envy. When you're not trying to inspire any of these emotions, it's very inconvenient, but... part of you wonders what you really do want going forward. Perhaps those aren't necessarily bad emotions to inspire. When you look at the tattoos yourself, they bring many thoughts and memories to your mind, but arousal always comes with them.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Leaky">>
		You might need to consider getting some super absorbent sanitary pads, ones that you can change out every few hours. The Leaky Curse isn't just keeping your crotch moist, it's dripping your juices down your legs. It's not entirely unpleasant, a gentle euphoric feeling accompanies your condition, and offsets the irritation the stickiness causes. <br><br>However, the way the few other explorers you have encountered since you took on this Curse have looked at you has been awkward at best. One seemed to think you were wetting yourself, another caught on to what was happening and started giving you very lurid looks. The worst part is, this constant leakiness is not relieving arousal, it just makes you constantly ready. Maybe the lurid looks you got were in equal part due to your own apparent desperation.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Wandering Hands">>
		Your naughty, naughty fingers seem to be on auto-pilot whenever you're not forcing them to do something else, and autopilot is apparently fondling you and touching yourself in lewd ways. How many times a day do you find your hands doing something naughty? The answer is: constantly. The Wandering Hands Curse is unrelenting, always trying to edge you into sex addiction. It doesn't matter what you're trying to do, start a fire, draw a map, discuss a plan with others, before you know it you've got at least one hand rubbing between your legs.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Urine Reamplification A">>
		Pee... why did you take a Curse that makes you have to pee all the time? You're still continent, you can control it, you can hold it, or that's what you tell yourself. In truth, having to find a place to pee every fifteen to thirty minutes is quite a nuisance, and you've had multiple accidents while sleeping. Down here, it's a nuisance, but there are plenty of trees and rocks. What about back on the surface though? You're afraid of the social ramifications to this Curse. You might even have to start wearing diapers.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Barter System">>
		These reality warping Curses always seem to surprise you. When you accepted the Barter System Curse you didn't quite see yourself giving three guys blowjobs so you could replace the pair of shoes that you brought with you that have finally worn out. Once upon a time, when you didn't have money, those with goods to sell would fold their arms and expect you to leave. Now, the Curse seems to make them go far out of their way to find some way that you can get what you want by doing enough sexual favors for them, their friends, their clients, their workers, and on and on. <br><br>You're pretty sure that before you obtained this Curse, none of those people would have been interested, and none would have been shameless enough to actually work through an elaborate exchange of goods, favors, and funds on your behalf just so that you could purchase what you wanted by being a massive whore. When you get back to the surface (if you get back) you're half-inclined to try to use this Curse to buy a house, or a mansion, or a country. You're just curious what would happen, but also afraid that it might work, but that when you involve that many people in a proposal, you can't just say "no" after everything is worked out. Would you be forced to be a sex slave for life in return for buying an estate?
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Shared Space">>
		One of the reasons so many people love pets is that they feel like they have permission to pet them, to hold them, to snuggle with them whenever they feel like it. And ever since you obtained the Shared Space Curse, people treat you like that, with one crucial difference. People generally don't have any sexual interest in pets, but they definitely have sexual interest in you. <br><br>Somehow, the Curse makes it so that even as people put their hands all over you in very inappropriate ways, everyone watching treats it as normally as a person petting a cat. The people groping you don't even realize they're doing anything too forward. All their perceptions around you are altered. You struggle with the change, and how you feel about it. Is it really the fault of others that they're treating you in accordance with the Curse? Is this how you want to be treated? You're still not sure. However, as abrupt as the touches of others can be, they're normally kind enough, and sometimes quite pleasant.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Weakling">>
		Being given the Weakling Curse has made you keenly aware that you're absolutely unable to defend yourself. The only thing you could wrestle is an empty cardboard box, and even then probably only if it's wet. Anyone else you encounter, everything else you encounter, they aren't just stronger than you, they're comically stronger than you. More than that though, just moving all your stuff around has become far more difficult. <br><br>That carry weight limit that they kept talking about on the surface is very real, and yours is now very low. Even that is a struggle for you though. It's a weird feeling. You can move about just fine with your body, but every bit of weight added to your body feels like its weight has been magically augmented on an incredible scale. You'd have as much luck lifting a mountain as lifting another person. But you can climb things as easily as ever as long as you're not carrying too much extra stuff. You swear, you can almost hear the Abyss snicker when you forget about your own weakness and fail to pick up something that should be relatively trivial and struggle.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Random Orgasms">>
		When you obtained the Random Orgasms Curse, you hadn't expected just how disruptive it would be to your everyday life. The other day you were trying to scale a small cliff when a random orgasm racked your body and very nearly made you fall off the cliff face. Death by orgasm, that would have been pretty embarrassing. <br><br>You're certain that the social ramifications are going to be very awkward, but now, after the cliff incident, you find yourself approaching every task by first asking "What happens if I randomly orgasm while doing this?". As humiliating as your condition is, as scary as it makes some things, the euphoria you feel during these intense events is undeniable. Even as part of you fears the next toe curling orgasm that will hit you, another part craves it, and that part seems to be growing.
	<</if>>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Creature of the Night">>
		<<if $mc.hasCurse("Clothing Restriction A") && $mc.hasCurse("Clothing Restriction C")>>
			You truly are a creature of the night now, not so much because vampires can't shelter from the sun while still being out in the day, but because you took this Curse in conjunction with multiple clothing restriction Curses. Some people say that vampires can turn into bats, that's not true, or at least you can't (you tried) but then you realized it hardly matters because you were already total dingbat to pick this combination of Curses. You're not just a vampire, you're "the" naked vampire. Going out exclusively in the dark is going to be very inconvenient, especially given your new thirst for blood and the fact that you can't enter anyone's home unless they give you permission. You absolutely have to drink blood now, but wherever you end up living you're probably going to have to reach some consensual arrangements to satisfy your thirst. You shiver at the prospect of what others might demand from you in exchange for both their blood and keeping your secret. Unless you're lucky enough to get some incredible combination of Relics that can turn you into a super-fast super-strong predator, consensual feeding is probably your only option to keep your thirst fulfilled.
		<<else>>
			When the Abyss gave you a Curse as straightforward as Creature of the Night, you were sure there had to be a catch. Become a vampire? That's rather straight forward, isn't it? Well, there sort of wasn't a catch, except that drinking blood feel amazing, and being without it for a long time is an agony that would drive you mad. Also you need to be very careful around the sun to make sure whatever clothing and accessories you have are adequately protecting you. Going forward, you think you have 2 options. You can either find some willing blood donors for you, which would put you in their debt and might put you in an awkward position, or you could become a transient, finding victims through surprise or guile getting a meal, and then moving on. Technically, you're not alive anymore, but semantics aside, it's up to you what kind of life you want to try to live.

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Minish-ish">>
		<<if $hiredCompanions.length > 0>>
			Thank goodness you didn't come down here alone. Now that the Minish-ish Curse has reduced you to mouse-like size, you're relying on a companion to carry basically everything for you. There are advantages to being this small. You can squeeze into tiny little places... don't think about that too much. Your ability to move and jump might be lower than it once was in objective terms, but for your size, you can do some amazing stuff. You can jump more than your entire body height, since being light has its advantages. Still, yesterday you were tired of running and asked $hiredCompanions[0].name to carry you. Their hands felt so huge around you, but in an odd way, it was wonderfully comforting and exciting.
		<<else>>
			Oh no, this is a disaster. The Minish-ish Curse has left you so tiny and you came down here alone. You're going to have to act like a squirrel and run back and forth with individual food parcels and individual bottles of water, moving them from 1 pile to another, if you want to get anywhere while still keeping even your food with you. Some Relics are now impossible for you to move! What are you going to do? More than that, you're afraid of just leaving your stuff in a pile. What if some one or something sees it and just helps itself? Burying your supplies really is starting to make a lot of sense in this context. If only you had somebody big to help you on this giant journey, but you don't. This is going to be very tough.>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Colossal-able">>
		It's not fair. You're huge. You should be able to move quickly, and you can, except the Abyss is so treacherous that everything is cramped. Cliff side paths you could once have walked along now are merely a crevice to put the first joint of your fingers in. Your body is tough enough to endure some of your new tribulations, but walking through a forest now means snapping dozens of tree branches with every step, or carefully lifting up your legs over the treetops and setting them down ahead of you (a process that still is not gentle for either you or the trees). Small trees are like prickly ground-cover to you, but large ones are like brambles that you have to wade through. Then there are cavern ceilings, which sometimes are low enough to force you to crawl or stop you altogether. <br><br>You could carry a small house in your hand, but ugh, everything is just so awkward now. There are some layers of the Abyss where you might feel comfortable taking up residence, and on the surface you'd be... very notable, but certainly able to stretch out. You're going to have to change the way you live life though. Your new size just doesn't match many of the skills you previously practiced.

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Consent Dissent">>
		The Consent Dissent Curse comes with the smallest hint of a loophole, a tiny sliver of control. It's a game of semantics, really, predicated on the very concept of consent. With the knowledge of the Curse's mechanics, you could navigate its treacherous waters. By orchestrating a scene of dubious agreement, or displaying dissent with conviction, you can momentarily dodge the Curse's grasp. Yet, should mutual consent seem clear, the Curse reasserts its cruel grip. The dominant participant bears the heaviest burden, facing a sudden halt in their tracks or a forceful surge beyond the boundaries of initial consent. The option to choose remains, but the Curse skews the scales, compelling others toward excess. <br><br>

		Awareness of the Curse does little to shield from its invasive influence, which toys with the psyche and floods the body with an unwelcome rush of hormones. It renders intimacy a labyrinth of tension and fear. When others turn their attentions on you unbidden, you know that they’re only partly responsible for their actions. They choose under the Curse's shadow, a skewed reality where right and wrong blur. You could play along, offering consent in hopes of stopping it, but it's a gamble. The Curse might provoke them to amplify their actions, exploiting your acquiescence. It's a grim revelation that within the depths of human souls, darkness sometimes stirs. And the Consent Dissent Curse seems all too eager to draw out the most sinister threads of our nature.  It is ironic, that for all the horrors in the Abyss, humans can sometimes eclipse even the most nightmarish creatures in depravity and malice.

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "The Maxim">>
		The Chasm Crawler lodged within your $mc.getCurse(TheMaxim).location stirs slightly, sending an involuntary shiver down your spine. A tear glistens at the corner of your eye as a wave of unwelcome warmth floods your senses, guiding a trail of erotic desire straight to the creature's abode. Though it has caused pain before, this time it is merciful, dancing along the fine line between discomfort and delight.  Its stimulation is not comfortable, but you’d be lying if you said that part of you didn’t enjoy it just a little bit. However, the control it holds over you is unsettling — it is a parasite and you are its host, and nothing you do can change that. <br><br>

		The potential for it to bend you to its will looms over you like a shadow. A shudder at the thought that, should it wish, it could reduce you to a whimpering form, eager to fulfill its every demand. Yet, it remains content for now, soaking in the juices your body produces. Despite your conflicted emotions, there is an underlying truth that chills your bones: the Chasm Crawler holds the means to end you. It exists in a symbiosis where your death would serve no purpose, and it is content with the status quo. For now.

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Below the Veil">>
		Now that you are Below the Veil, you ponder the nature of the Curse. Was it truly a Curse, or rather a blessing? Your senses have sharpened, revealing the world in its raw, unvarnished form. The material façade quivers and distorts under your intense gaze, eliciting a knowing smirk from your lips. Laughter almost escapes you, a reaction to the absurdity of it all. You peer through the veil of reality, understanding the inherent fragility of everything around you - places, people, their fleeting concerns. Humans, with their comical obsessions over trivialities, seem even more absurd now. Whisper a truth in their ears, and watch them recoil in denial, their emotions a turbulent mix of anger and fear. Most retreat into the comforting cocoon of their make-believe worlds, while a few crumble under the weight of unvarnished reality. You marvel at your own resilience, your ability to grasp and accept these truths. Are you stronger than the rest, or merely blessed by the Abyss? One thing is certain: you have transcended your former self. Your initial quest now seems laughably insignificant compared to the profound transformation you've undergone.<br><br>

		Loneliness is your only companion now, a fitting reflection of your unique existence. No ordinary soul could endure your presence for long. This solitude rsets you apart from the superficial world, as it should. Only another being, one who transcends the mundane and peers into the depths as you do, could ever hope to join you in this solitary journey.

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Erased">>
		The Erased Curse wraps around you like a heavy, invisible cloak, severing every thread that once tied you to your past. As you move through the dim pathways of the Abyss, you feel the weight of apparent nonexistence pressing down on you.<br><br>

		<<if $hiredCompanions.length > 0>>
			Your companions eye you with a blend of confusion and curiosity. Their gazes, once warm and familiar, now hold a flicker of doubt, as if they're trying to recognize a long-lost friend in your face. Conversations are punctuated with pauses, their words tiptoeing around the fact that they no longer know who you truly are. You notice their subtle shifts in behavior, a hesitance that wasn't there before, as if they're afraid to unravel the mystery of your existence. The Curse not only erased your past but also cast a shadow of uncertainty over your present relationships.<br><br>
		<</if>>

		The more you try to cling to the fragments of your past, the more they slip away, like sand through your fingers. In this new existence, you are free yet confined, known yet unknown, present yet Erased.<br><br>

	<<if $tempCurse.name === "Bimbo Babble" && $hiredCompanions.length > 0>>
		You're, like, totally trying to explain this super important thing to $hiredCompanions[0].name, but the words just aren't coming out right! It's as if your brain is, um, scrambling everything before it reaches your mouth. You know what you want to say, but it's coming out all ditzy and confused. $hiredCompanions[0].name looks at you with a mix of amusement and concern, and you can feel your cheeks getting hot with embarrassment. It's not just talking either - even your texts are full of "likes" and "totallys" now. You never realized how much this Curse would, like, affect your daily life and stuff. It's kinda frustrating, but also kinda funny? Maybe you just need to, like, embrace your inner bimbo or whatever.
