!Layer 9 - Reaches of Oceanus
@@You submerge into the water and descend. Slowly the colorless architecture of the eighth layer fades, replaced once more by organic stone. And then the world opens up before you: you emerge from a vertical shaft of water and into an entire underground ocean, stretching further in every direction than your eyes can make out. You briefly look down and the word "thalassophobia" immediately rises up to smack you in the face. Light is swiftly blotted out in every direction away from the shaft, and you're engulfed by a dark stillness. If there is ground somewhere below you, you can't see it. Let yourself drift downwards, and you'll be swallowed up completely by that gloom, falling endlessly into this massive world of no light, no air, only water. The only way downward into the Abyss is to dive into it, taking up the name of "diver" perhaps far more literally than any before you.

There's nothing like an entire ocean to put a premature end to an adventure. You'll //need// to keep whatever you're using to breathe underwater with you and active at all times or you will drown and die.

If you have the Seafolk Curse, your hydrodynamic body and fins serve to speed your swimming up significantly, decreasing all travel time costs on this layer by 5 days. It's also quite dark and difficult to navigate, so a source of light like a flashlight would help by reducing travel times by 5 days - though it should go without saying that fire-based light won't work. Thankfully, pretty much everything in Outset Town's shop besides the torches and balloons is waterproof, and works just fine underwater. No need to worry about water ruining your food or smartphone.

In case you're wondering, the Miasma somehow alleviates the pressure of the water above your, thankfully preventing you from being crushed or subject to oxygen toxicity if you travel too deep.

Be prepared to eat a lot of meals and spend many nights (as if that word still means anything) sleeping underwater. It'll probably be disorienting at first. 

Hopefully you'll be able to get used to it.

	As you drift in the underwater gloom, the reality of your situation sets in. Your equipment, once your shield against the dangers of the Abyss, is gone, lost in the Catastrophe. More painfully, your companions, those who had journeyed with you, shared your struggles, and fought by your side, are no more. Their absence is a heavy weight, a void that the Phoenix Obol's power cannot fill.

	You are alone now, stripped of your tools and allies, in the heart of an unforgiving sea.

	It seems that the fish are gone for now, but perhaps you'll be able to find some eventually.

	At first, the Elder seems to have completely disappeared, with nothing near you. But as time passes, you spot the tentacles at the edge of your vision once again. However, they never seem to approach you, as if the Elder has become wary of you after the Catastrophe. Even though it lives on, it seems that the Elder will no longer bother you down here.
<<else>>
	<<if $layerTemp === 1>>
		The muffled silence of the ocean is briefly interrupted by the distant and eerie sound of water moving in vast volumes. Before you can comprehend its source, a massive unseen undercurrent tugs at you, spiraling you in a direction you hadn't intended to go. In the vast, unending expanse of the deep, it feels as if the Abyss itself is toying with you, like a cat with a mouse. It takes a few heart-pounding moments of effort to escape its grip and regain control. Shaken, you proceed with renewed caution.<br><br>
	<<elseif $layerTemp === 2>>
		The water suddenly becomes filled with a soft hue. All around you, tiny plankton-like creatures begin to glow. Their tiny bodies illuminate your path, and for a brief moment, the crushing darkness of the Abyss feels less intimidating. The bloom lasts but a few moments before the creatures scatter, leaving you in the darkness once more.<br><br>
	<<elseif $layerTemp === 3 && $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.name === "Saeko")>>

		<<say $companionSaeko>>That appears to be a thermocline. It's a boundary where water of different temperatures meet. Causes that visual distortion.<</say>><br>
		
		Her voice is steady, filled with the reserved intrigue of a scientist making an observation, but the weight of the Abyss's bleakness mutes any overt enthusiasm. As you navigate through the curtain, the sudden change in temperature is unnerving. Saeko remains focused, jotting down brief notes on a waterproof pad, her demeanor a mix of curiosity and caution as you continue your journey.<br><br>
	<<elseif $layerTemp === 4>>
		In these expansive depths, you feel an overwhelming sense of smallness. Everywhere you turn, there's just the vastness of water, pressing upon your psyche. The sensation of weightlessness combined with the eerie stillness makes you keenly aware of your isolation. The immediate vicinity feels like a shroud, wrapping around you, with only the muffled sound of your own heartbeat as a constant companion.<br><br>

		As you plunge through the depths of the ninth layer, a vast, boundless underground ocean unfolds around you. Its magnitude is both mesmerizing and terrifying, reminding you of the insignificance of your existence in the face of the world around you. The impenetrable darkness that engulfs the expanse is disorienting, with the distant shaft of light above fading rapidly as you dive deeper. The chilling silence is punctuated only by the rhythmic beats of your own heart, the muffled sound of water pressing against your ears, and the slightest hint of something lurking just out of view.<br><br>

	As you ascend through the waters of the ninth layer, the overwhelming vastness of this underground ocean grips your senses. Around you, darkness prevails, a cloak of obscurity that makes the shaft of water from which you emerged seem like a distant memory. Your eyes strain to penetrate the gloom, but it's a futile effort; light fades into nothingness, leaving you suspended in a realm where the concepts of up and down blur. The notion of an endless fall into this aquatic void sends a shiver down your spine.

	It's an eerie comfort, knowing that, while the depths threaten to swallow you whole, the miasma shields you from the ocean's more crushing aspects. 

	Eventually, you recognize the faint glimmer of light from when you first descended into the water and follow it upwards into the alien space of the eighth layer.

<br><br>
The majestic pillars loom above, their surfaces worn and yet still echoing tales of bygone eras. The central altar, bathed in a purplish hue, beckons you closer, its glow ensnaring your senses.
<br><br>
The weight of history is palpable, making the water around you feel denser, colder. As you near the altar, you notice the meticulously carved channels that spread outwards, their designs seemingly alive, shifting subtly under your gaze.

A peculiar mixture of awe and dread fills you. The allure of the significant power promised by the sanctuary clashes with the grim reality of its price. The stillness of the Abyss around you amplifies your internal turmoil. Floating before the altar, you ponder the profound choice ahead. To harness the sanctuary's power, a life must be taken — a decision that cannot be made lightly.

		For a brief moment, there's an eerie stillness as you float amidst the weightless tranquility, your gaze locked on the lifeless form before you. Abruptly, the crystals encircling the altar burst into a shimmering glow, casting shades of light across the watery depths. In the altar's heart, a spectral purple flame erupts, its light piercing the gloom. Instinctively, you shield your eyes from its brilliance.

<<CollectRelic $relic103>>\
<<if !setup.passingTime()>>

The waters of this layer are often dark, but sometimes there's a bit of light trickling through the currents from a source you can't quite place. The visibility is limited, often restricted to mere outlines of distant objects, illuminated faintly against the gloom. At times, the waters turn pitch black, obscuring all but the immediate surroundings.

Even though the miasma does keep the water from becoming threateningly dense, it's not just water in these depths; there's an array of debris - rocks, both minuscule and colossal, float suspended. The pressure in denser if you get close to them. You're uncertain if these rocks generate the gravitational anomalies or if they've simply been ensnared by hidden gravity wells scattered throughout this layer. As you maneuver past them, you remain focused; the Relic you seek is elsewhere.

Amidst the aquatic expanse, you occasionally spot solitary fish, none particularly large.  On the rocks, sparse life clings on: a few sponges, perhaps a rare crustacean. The longer you explore, the more evident the barrenness of this ecosystem becomes. It's not dying, nor utterly lifeless, but eerily sparse, as if thoroughly scavenged. The thought sends a shiver down your spine, a reminder of the Elder, the vast entity ruling these depths. Among the debris, you glimpse remnants of a lost world: sunken ships, sculptures, fragments of buildings. Where did all of this come from?

Eventually, you find a place that may hold what you seek. Carved marble pillars emerge from the gloom as you swim towards the cluster of debris. Those pillars are toppled, lying in a jumbled heap in this submerged realm. As you approach, you note a peculiar change: the water's salinity decreases. You've encountered freshwater pockets before, but none as expansive as this. Undeterred, you dive towards the wreckage.

Buried under the chaotic heap of marble, you find it - an earthenware jug, deceptively simple yet elegantly crafted. As your hand nears its mouth, you notice a current flowing away from the mouth of the jug. It's not a torrent, but there is a steady stream of water flowing out of the jar and into the surrounding waters. Water flows steadily from the jug, untainted by the everpresent miasma of the Abyss. A strange thought occurs to you - this jug, endlessly pouring forth fresh water, could it be the source of all the water in this layer? The notion seems far-fetched, yet you can't dismiss it entirely. One thing becomes clear: your need for water bottles and flasks is now a thing of the past.

<b>You now have an infinite source of water. You no longer need to use water bottles or scavenge for water to survive.</b>

	The strength of this Curse takes you by surprise. our penis surges to full erection and continues to grow in size. The base, shaft, and tip swell at a disconcerting rate. Drops of precum ooze from the tip like thick honey, yet the growth doesn't cease. 

	Finally, the Curse releases its grip, but your jaw drops in disbelief as you realize you now possess a $mc.penisCor inch long member. The erection lingers for a while longer, and adapting to such a massive endowment without it hindering your movement will surely demand practice. You wince from a pinching sensation as you awkwardly hobble forward.

<<elseif $mc.penisCor<1 && $mc.breastsCor > 0>>
	The strength of this Curse takes you by surprise. Your nipples protrude like taut pencil erasers, and tiny streams of milk seep out as an intense pressure and stretching sensation engulfs your breasts. Your swelling bosom strains against your skin, momentarily as taut as overinflated balloons. The skin stretches to accommodate the expanding mass, and the dribbles of milk evolve into three powerful squirts before the ordeal ends.

	You gawk at your new $mc.breastsLabel cup breasts, and even your heavy breathing sends tremors through them. You wonder if bras exist that can support such a voluptuous transformation. Surely they must, but you feel off-balance as you teeter forward.

<<else>>
	You are overwhelmed by sensation as the Curse grips you, and you fall to the ground. Your back arches as your penis springs to full erection, and bulges ever larger. Your nipples jut out like pencil erasers and small dribbles of milk start to come out of them as an intense pressure and a stretching sensation fills your breasts. The base, the shaft, the tip of your penis are swelling to an alarming degree and drops of precum start oozing out of the tip. As your breasts swell to gargantuan proportions, the dribbles of milk turn into periodic gushes. Then, finally, the Curse releases its grip.
	
	You stare slack-jawed down at yourself as you realize you're now sporting a $mc.penisCor inch long dong, which is throbbing in sync with your pulse, between your two heaving $mc.breastsLabel cup breasts. This is a pretty dramatic change to your body. You just lie there on the ground for a minute coming to grips with what has just happened to you.

A strange tingle washes over your body, and you realize that you will never again have consensual sex. Never again feel the embrace of a mutual lover. Never again share a physically intimate moment with the one you love, who loves you back in turn. Hopefully you can make peace with this loss, eventually.

:: Take on Tickly Tentacles
<<set _curse = new TicklyTentacles()>>\
<<set $mc.addCurse(_curse)>><<set $corruption += _curse.corr>>\
[img[setup.ImagePath + _curse.pic]]

The cool underwater expanse around you seems to shudder and churn. The sensation is distant and eerie, but it's not the chill of the Abyss that sends shivers up your spine. A pulsating, sickening warmth crawls across your skin, spreading from your midriff. Your chest tightens, and your breath catches in your throat. You feel a sharp sting, like the bite of a predator, and you instinctively try to swat it away, but your hands find nothing. In a panic, you look down.

The sight that meets your eyes is so grotesque, so otherworldly, it takes your breath away. Emerging from your lower abdomen, just above your hip, a thick, writhing tentacle bulges from your skin. The inky, dark violet appendage throbs, thickening and elongating as it snakes out from your body. It's a dreadful sight, and for a moment, you can only watch in shocked silence. 

Your shock is broken when the tentacle flexes, revealing a hide of glistening, wet suckers. The feeling of them fluttering against your side is strange and intrusive, and you gasp, your heart hammering against your chest. There's an alien intelligence there in your new limb, a hint of a separate consciousness that resists your efforts to control it. It moves on its own, slithering in lazy spirals around your waist, exploratory and teasing.

A wicked dread takes hold of you, only heightened by the isolation of the Abyss. This tentacle, this thing, it's a part of you now, but also something separate. Something primal. An uncanny, embarrassing realization dawns on you - the tentacle's potential for lewd mischief. A thrill of fear courses through you, for yourself and anyone else who might find themselves in its grasp.

The thoughts make your stomach clench with unease and a strange, unfamiliar desire. Even now, the tentacle shivers against your thigh, as though sharing in your thoughts, eager to explore and to exploit.

:: Take on Eye-scream
<<set _curse = new Eyescream()>>\
<<set $mc.addCurse(_curse)>><<set $corruption += _curse.corr>>\
[img[setup.ImagePath + _curse.pic]]

A sensation akin to a pressure begins to build in the center of your chest. It’s gradual at first, nothing more than a slight discomfort, but it quickly escalates, an insistent throb that demands your attention. Still, you're far more preoccupied with the dark expanse of water around you, the chilling stillness of the abyss that seems intent on swallowing you whole. It's a daunting realization of your own insignificance, a sentiment that makes the burgeoning sensation in your chest seem trivial in comparison.

Yet, it’s an irritation that soon morphs into a throbbing ache. The cold water around you doesn't seem to have any mitigating effect on the searing heat that erupts within your chest. A moment of panic seizes you as the pain intensifies, a hot, stabbing sensation that echoes to your very core. Your instincts tell you to cry out, but you quickly remember your surroundings and restrain yourself, your heart pounding wildly against the intrusive force building in your chest.

All at once, the pressure breaks, and you experience an odd sensation as if a bubble had popped within you. Your hand moves instinctively to your chest and comes in contact with a throbbing mass, a foreign addition to your body. It takes you a moment to understand what has just occurred.

An eye. A large, bulbous eye has taken residence in the center of your chest, just above your sternum. Its gaze, if it could be called that, stares blankly ahead into the Abyss, but the sight it provides you is fragmented, distorted.

You can see, albeit in a hazy, distorted manner, the unending darkness of the ocean before you and the tiny pinprick of light from the water shaft above you. The sight is disconcerting, overwhelming, the third eye’s vision intermingling with your own, resulting in a strange new perspective on the world around you.

:: Take on A Mouthful
<<set _curse = new AMouthful()>>\
<<set $mc.addCurse(_curse)>><<set $corruption += _curse.corr>>\
[img[setup.ImagePath + _curse.pic]]

Just when you think you've accustomed yourself to the harsh reality of the Abyss, a sudden, unsettling feeling crawls over your skin. The water around you seems to constrict, almost like a living entity, wrapping itself around you with a preternatural firmness.

A moment of panic ensues. You check your oxygen supply, hoping it isn't a malfunction. But it's not. It's something else. Something far more intimate and strange.

You feel a ripple, a distortion running through your body, originating from somewhere along your left forearm. Startled, you bring your arm in front of your masked face. Through the dim light filtering from above, you see an unsettling sight that makes your heart skip a beat. There, on your forearm, where smooth skin should be, gapes a mouth. A large, grinning mouth with lips contorting into a gruesome smile.

Bizarrely, it doesn't hurt, nor is it bleeding. Rather, it appears to be part of you, as if it had been there all along, just waiting for the right moment to reveal itself.

An attempt to close it results in no change; the grin remains, perpetually etched onto your skin. You watch, mortified, as the lips move, opening and closing in a disturbingly human manner. You realize you can control it, move it as if it were just another part of your body.

Fear gives way to curiosity, and you find yourself testing its functionality. Grabbing a ration from your pack, you hesitantly feed the mouth. The lips part, accepting the morsel, and you feel an odd sensation of fullness in your stomach. It’s as if the mouth bypasses the usual route and connects directly to your belly.

Somehow, despite the alien nature of your new mouth, it somehow seems almost natural, and you get the feeling you'll get used to it eventually, as bizarre as that thought is.

:: Take on Below the Veil
<<set _curse = new BelowTheVeil()>>\
<<set $mc.addCurse(_curse)>><<set $corruption += _curse.corr>>\
[img[setup.ImagePath + _curse.pic]]

An unseen force seizes you, not in your body but somewhere deeper, in the very essence of your being. You reach out, flailing in the icy water, but there's nothing to grasp, only the vast emptiness of the deep. The pressure around you intensifies and it is as if you've touched the void itself, tasted the edges of an unfathomable <<print Creepify.encode("Truth")>>.

A cold shiver slithers its way up your spine, gnawing at your courage. Your body remains the same, yet, something within you has been irreversibly altered.

Your perception sharpens, each breath fills you with an otherworldly awareness. You feel an intrusive gaze sweeping over you, as though the Abyss itself acknowledges your presence. The realization hits you hard: your 'self', your identity, your personal mask, is now just a fragile façade.

Your thoughts are consumed with the change, so alien and yet intimate. Its echo beats like a second heart within you, a grim metronome to your existence. You can’t help but wonder how your newfound nature will shape your future. Adventure, exploration, camaraderie — all seem like distant memories from another life.

Your skin crawls with an invisible frost, a sensation born not from the surrounding water but from the Abyss's Curse. The implications dawn upon you; even if you could convince a companion to journey with you, the mere sight of you would quickly drive them to madness. Interaction, connection, all would be tainted by this curse. The thought of solitary existence stretches before you, as dark and endless as the ocean surrounding you.

Around you, the aquatic world carries on undisturbed. The light from the shaft above you, once a beacon of hope and a link to the world above, now only seems to accentuate your alienation. You're suspended in the vast, indomitable Abyss, no longer a 'diver', but a being of fear and madness, Cursed to wander the world alone.

	As you glide through the murky depths of the Abyss, the water around you is cold and oppressive, a vast expanse of unknowns. Your destination lies ahead, but an eerie sensation creeps along your spine. You are not alone.<br><br>

	In the inky darkness, a presence looms, immense and ancient. The Elder, an entity from the dawn of time, exists here in a form beyond comprehension. Its malevolence is palpable, yet it holds back, its curiosity piqued by your rare intrusion.<br><br>

	Suddenly, a gentle current brushes against you, and you freeze. From the unfathomable dark, a voice echoes, one that is not heard but felt, vibrating through your mind without a sound.<br><br>

	<span class="elder-entity">《Existence... singular... <span class="light">curious</span>... depths traverse. Why?》</span><br><br>

	The words, or perhaps concepts is more accurate, form clear thoughts in your mind. It's The Elder, its thoughts invading yours, a strange intelligence so alien it defies understanding. You sense no immediate hostility, but the sheer power behind each concept is overwhelming.<br><br>

	Around you, the darkness seems to pulse with unseen life. The Elder's presence is everywhere yet nowhere, its many tentacles hidden in the shadows, ready to strike or to explore.<br><br>

	<span class="elder-entity">《Awareness... fleeting... ephemeral. Your presence... <span class="light">ripples</span>.》</span><br><br>

	You feel the weight of its gaze, an invisible force examining you. The Elder, a creature from a time before time, watches and waits.<br><br>

	<<if $elderCounterFirst===0>>
		You have been traversing the ninth layer for what feels like an eternity, the darkness unyielding. As you pause to orient yourself, a sudden change in the water's flow draws your attention. The currents whisper around you, carrying a barely perceptible message.<br><br>

		<span class="elder-entity">《Sight... unseen. Watch... <span class="light">observe</span>. Tiny life... strange path.》</span><br><br>

		The Elder's presence is like a shadow at the edge of your perception, observing you with a curiosity that feels distant yet intense. You sense it probing, testing the waters of your existence, its vast intelligence brushing against the fringes of your mind.<br><br>
	<<elseif $elderCounterFirst===1>>
		Days later, the Abyss feels less empty. You're increasingly aware of movements in the darkness, massive yet impossibly subtle. The Elder's curiosity seems to grow, its invisible gaze more focused, more intense.<br><br>

		<span class="elder-entity">《Closer... study. Unfamiliar... intriguing. Small being... <span class="light">deep</span> waters.》</span><br><br>

		The words echo in your mind, a discordant symphony of thoughts and impressions. The Elder is drawing nearer, its interest in you evolving, becoming something more palpable. Shadows shift around you, suggesting the presence of vast tentacles exploring the waters you traverse.<br><br>
	<<elseif $elderCounterFirst===2>>
		In the heart of the Abyss, where the pressure of the deep weighs heavily, you feel a change. The water itself seems to vibrate with a strange energy. The Elder is no longer a distant observer; it's an active presence, its curiosity taking on a more aggressive edge.<br><br>

		<span class="elder-entity">《Intruder... probe. Depths... <span class="light">why</span>?》</span><br><br>

		The Elder's communication is more direct, more insistent. You sense a challenge in its tone, a questioning of your right to be in these ancient depths. The darkness around you seems to constrict, as if the very Abyss is responding to The Elder's growing agitation.<br><br>
	<<else>>
		The ninth layer has changed for you. It's no longer a place of exploration,, but a domain where you are constantly watched, analyzed. The Elder's presence is overwhelming, an oppressive force that seems to crowd the waters around you.<br><br>

		<span class="elder-entity">《Close... close. <span class="light">understanding</span> nears... intentions questioned.》</span><br><br>

		The Elder's thoughts now carry a hint of menace, a growing impatience with your continued presence in its realm. You feel it all around, a monstrous intelligence that could easily snuff out your existence. The water churns as if agitated by the movements of colossal limbs, a prelude to an impending confrontation that feels inevitable.<br><br>

		In the murky depths, you suddenly sense a shift in the water's pressure. Before you can react, a massive tentacle lashes out from the darkness, its speed almost blurring its existence. It strikes the water beside you, sending a powerful shockwave that knocks you off course.<br><br>

		<span class="elder-entity">《Test... strength. Resilience... <span class="light">observe</span>.》</span><br><br>

		The Elder's 'voice' resonates in your mind, a cold curiosity underlying its tone. The attack, while terrifying, seems more like a test than a true attempt to harm. The Elder is gauging you, probing your reactions to sudden violence.<br><br>
	<<elseif $elderCounterSecond===1>>
		You have barely recovered from the previous encounter when another tentacle, thicker and more menacing, emerges from the abyssal gloom. It wraps around your leg with a crushing force, dragging you downwards before releasing you abruptly.<br><br>

		<span class="elder-entity"><span class="light">《Fear</span>... sense. Strength... measure.》</span><br><br>

		The Elder's fascination seems to grow with your struggle. The grip of its tentacle was enough to seriously injure you, yet it held back, its intent more to intimidate and test than to kill. You're left with the unnerving realization that The Elder is playing a dangerous game with you.<br><br>
	<<elseif $elderCounterSecond===2>>
		As you swim cautiously through a narrow chasm, several tentacles, sharp as razors, slice through the water towards you. You dodge desperately, but one grazes your arm, leaving a deep gash. The water around you clouds with your blood.<br><br>

		<span class="elder-entity">《Pain... understand. Fragile... <span class="light">life</span> form.》</span><br><br>

		The Elder's exploration into your physical limits becomes more aggressive. Its tentacles are instruments of both curiosity and cruelty, each strike a calculated move to inflict pain without causing fatal damage. It's as if The Elder is dissecting your very existence through violence.<br><br>
	<<else>>
		In a terrifying escalation, you find yourself suddenly ensnared by multiple tentacles. They coil around your body, exerting an immense pressure that threatens to crush your bones. Just as you feel you might black out, they release, leaving you to float helplessly in the water.<br><br>

		<span class="elder-entity">《Resist... <span class="light">survive</span>. Limits... explore.》</span><br><br>

		The Elder's actions are now openly hostile, yet there's a sense that it's still holding back, its true lethal power kept in check. This brutal play, a mere game to The Elder, leaves you battered and on the brink of despair, wondering what horrors lie ahead in this deadly battle with an ancient, alien intelligence.<br><br>

		You sense a sudden, dramatic shift in the Abyss. The water around you churns violently as The Elder reveals its true, terrifying intent. A massive tentacle, thick as a tree trunk, surges towards you with lethal speed, intent on impaling you. You barely evade, feeling the rush of water as it passes inches from your body.<br><br>

		<span class="elder-entity">《Merge... begin. Your <span class="light">end</span>... our extension.》</span><br><br>

		The Elder's voice is no longer a curious whisper but a thunderous decree. It's clear that it's no longer testing you; it's seeking to end you, to absorb your essence into its own ancient being. The sheer power of its attack leaves no doubt about its lethal capabilities.<br><br>
	<<elseif $elderCounterThird===1>>
		You're struggling to catch your breath when The Elder creates a powerful underwater vortex, aiming to disorient and trap you within its swirling depths. The force is overwhelming, pulling you towards a gaping maw lined with razor-sharp protrusions, a glimpse into a horrific fusion.<br><br>

		<span class="elder-entity">《Consume... integrate. <span class="light">inevitable</span>... assimilation.》</span><br><br>

		The Elder's intent to assimilate you into its consciousness is terrifyingly clear. Each movement is designed to weaken and ultimately consume you, a process of terrifying finality. Your struggle feels increasingly desperate against its immense power.<br><br>
	<<elseif $elderCounterThird===2>>
		In a relentless assault, a barrage of tentacles, each armed with bone-crushing strength and deadly precision, attacks from all directions. You're caught in a relentless storm, each strike more ferocious and accurate than the last. A tentacle smashes into your side, breaking ribs and leaving you gasping in pain.<br><br>

		<span class="elder-entity">《End nears... resistance <span class="light">futile</span>. Join... become one.》</span><br><br>

		The Elder's voice booms in your mind, a cacophony of finality. It's not just trying to kill you; it's trying to obliterate your very individuality, to absorb you into its ancient, alien existence. The sheer ferocity of its attack is unlike anything you've faced.<br><br>
	<<else>>
		Battered and barely clinging to consciousness, you realize The Elder is preparing its final move. A colossal tentacle, surrounded by countless others, descends upon you. It's not just an appendage; it's a conduit, a bridge to The Elder's own essence.<br><br>

		<span class="elder-entity">《End... begin. Merge... <span class="light">complete</span>.》</span><br><br>

		The Elder's voice is a monolithic presence in your mind, an inescapable force. As the tentacle wraps around you, you feel a terrifying pull, a sensation of your being starting to unravel and blend with something infinitely vast and incomprehensible. It's a process of annihilation and rebirth, the final act of The Elder's long, merciless pursuit.<br><br>

<<if !$forcedL9Ending>>As you swim through the vast depths of the ninth layer, each movement of your body propelling you deeper, the mere concept of sunlight seems as distant as the forgotten civilization that left behind the ruins you've found floating in the depths. The world around you darkens, only the smallest shimmers of miasma providing points of light in the all-encompassing gloom.

There, emerging from the inky blackness, is The Elder. Its gargantuan form undulates and writhes, a terrifying leviathan of pure prehistoric power. Enormous tentacles, tipped with luminescent bulbs, swirl around its form like the limbs of some grotesque, underwater deity. The Elder has lived since the dawn of time, grown in the darkness of the ocean's depths, a god unto itself in the alien world below the waves.

Terror seizes your heart as one of the gargantuan appendages snakes out towards you.<</if>> There's nowhere to hide, nowhere to run. You're in The Elder's world now, a mere plaything to this being of unfathomable power and alien intelligence.

It captures you in its inescapable grip, huge suckers pressing into your flesh as it pulls you closer. The air is forced from your lungs, the pressure squeezing the life from your body. You gasp, pulling in water instead of air, your lungs filling with the cold, salty liquid.

Just when you're on the brink of losing consciousness, the Elder allows you a gasp of air, reviving you just enough to prolong your suffering. It plays with you like this, bringing you to the edge of death and then pulling you back, torturing you with the promise of release that never comes.

Eventually, you can't take any more. Your body goes limp, the strength drained from your muscles. The world blurs around you, your senses numbing, and you surrender to the inevitability of your fate.

The Elder's tentacle shifts, bringing you over its massive, throbbing form. Your body is then forcibly attached to its own, like a grotesque graft on a monstrous tree. It begins to invade your body, cell by cell, tissue by tissue, replacing your flesh with its own.

You can feel your identity slipping away, subsumed by the sheer magnitude of The Elder's consciousness. Your thoughts, your feelings, your memories... all are being overwritten, becoming one with The Elder. Your existence as a separate entity ceases, swallowed by the primal mind of the ancient beast.

Soon, all that remains of you is a small part, a minor outgrowth on the colossal form of The Elder. You're no longer an individual, but a part of this alien being. Its alien desires, its unfathomable thoughts, now your own.

As the centuries roll on, you bear witness to the creation of new, horrific tentacle beasts birthed from your own form, each an extension of The Elder's will, spreading its dominion to the upper layers of the Abyss. You feel the perpetual cycle of being used, creating life, and enduring the relentless extraction of your sexual fluids.

And so it continues, for an eternity that stretches out until the stars burn out, and beyond. The Elder, with you as a part of it, continues its endless existence in the dark depths of the Abyss, a silent, terrible god in its underwater domain.

As your fingers hover over the trigger of the Catastrophe - a weapon of unfathomable power, a tempest contained within iron and steel - you feel the weight of your decision. This device, designed to unleash a cataclysmic force, is your last resort against the Elder. With a deep breath that tastes of determination, you press the button.

In an instant, the Abyss transforms. A colossal orb of incandescent fire erupts, a sun birthed in the heart of the ocean. The water around it vaporizes in a seething frenzy, creating a maelstrom of steam and energy. The explosion radiates outward, a relentless tide of destruction. Fish, once gliding through the water with effortless grace, are instantly obliterated. The Elder's tentacles meet their end in a blinding inferno, even if the main body is too far away to truly be killed.
<<if $hiredCompanions.length>0>>
Through the turbulent waters and the shimmering heat, you glimpse the silhouette of $hiredCompanions[0].name one last time. Their form, a steadfast presence throughout your journey, flickers and distorts, like a mirage being swallowed by the desert sun. In a heart-wrenching moment, $hiredCompanions[0].name vanishes, erased from existence.
	<<if $hiredCompanions.length>1>>

In these final moments, as the shockwave from the explosion engulfs you, the world around you becomes a blur of motion and light. Your equipment, once your lifeline in the deep, is now just debris caught in the maelstrom. You feel the searing heat as the ball of fire expands, reaching out to claim you. Your thoughts scatter, fragmented by the realization of your impending demise. In the last tick of time, you are atomized, becoming one with the cataclysm you unleashed.

As you bring the charm up to your eye and gaze deep into the red crystal, your vision fades and a new image comes clearly into view:

!Layer 9 - Reaches of Oceanus

As this layer is entirely underwater, ascending is actually relatively fast here. Returning to the eight layer will take 20 days and 120 corruption normally.

You float in an endless expanse of deep water. The stillness of the water is only interrupted by a hint of something sinister, something beyond all other threats, lurking just out of view. A sense of unease overwhelms you, but suddenly the image shifts and you see the splendor of the Relics that are available on this layer.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 10-relics.png']]

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 10-wonders.png']]

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and Curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 10-curses.png']]

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threats that await you on the layer. 

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 10-threats.png']]

But you aren't just looking at The Elder. The Elder is looking back at you. Even as your vision reaches through time, you can feel one of its many eyes following you, watching you as much as you watch it.\
<p class="elder-entity">Why are you <span class="light">here</span>? Why are you watching through time?

Do you wish to <span class="light">die</span>?</p>\

A cold sweat washes over you and a sense of revulsion forces you to retch.

Finally, the vision fades, leaving you standing once again where you were before, with only a brief sense of motion sickness as you orient yourself back to your physical body. As you look at the Gleam Dazer once again, you notice the Relic is cracked and broken.
