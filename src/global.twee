:: Habitation Ending [ending]
You've reached the end of your journey due to a successful habitation ending. Was it worth it? Did you find what you were looking for?

You can find your collection of relics in your inventory, and your curses in the stats page.

Feel free to begin a new journey, by restarting and choosing the new game+ option. Also feel free to post your build on the thread for the game, the creator of this adaptation always loves to see how people's adventures went!


:: Adjustments [noreturn]
Use this page ONLY to adjust numbers due to interactions that save you money or resources that are not already accounted for in the game, or if there was a bug.

Do not cheat or fear the consequences of angering the things that lurk deep in the Abyss.


[[Adjust dubloons]]
[[Adjust corruption]]
[[Adjust time]]
[[Adjust water]]
[[Adjust food]]
[[Adjust bullets]]

Many options have their abilities as something like a light source or heat source automatically accounted for, but if you find a relic or combination that you think should give you an ability and it doesn't, use one of the following options to give that ability to yourself.

Click this if you have found something that can be used for cutting like a sword:
[[I have a Cutting Instrument|Adjustments][$cut = 1]]
[[No Cutting Instrument|Adjustments][$cut = 1]]

Click this if you have found something that can be used as a light source:
[[I have a Light|Adjustments][$light = 1]]
[[No Light|Adjustments][$light = 0]]

Click this if you have found something that can be used as a substantial heat source:
[[I have a source of Heat|Adjustments][$heat = 1]]
[[No Heat|Adjustments][$heat = 0]]

Click this if you have found something that can be used as a climbing rope:
[[I have something that can be a Rope|Adjustments][$rope = 1]]
[[No Rope|Adjustments][$rope = 0]]

Click this if you have found something that can be used for swimming underwater, similar to scuba gear:
[[I have something that can be used for Swimming|Adjustments][$scuba = 1]]
[[No Swimming|Adjustments][$scuba = 0]]

<<if $abyssKnow == 1>>Click this if you'd like to disable the use of your abyssal knowledge from the encyclopedia or Saeko (This will result in more side effects from foraging):

:: Version End
That's all for this version!

Thank you for playing version 0.4 of the interactive adaptation of Abyss Diver by FloricSpacer.

I'd like to hear any feedback about the current state of the game and any bugs or typos you've found!

I'm working on adding the remaining layers quickly, though it is pretty labor intensive, so that depends on my free time irl. I think a lot of the systems from the first few layers should carry over to later ones well, but there are also a lot of new mechanics that need to be implemented. Hopefully it doesn't take long and I can post the rest of the layers soon!

As I add more systems and the game gets more complicated under the hood, I expect many bugs that I didn't catch to manifest, so detailed bu reports for any errors you've encountered are very valuable.

Thanks again for playing!

<<if $items[1].count < -5>>
Your food ration count has gone below -5, indicating that you have avoided eating for a few days, but eventually starved to death. If you didn't realize what had happened, you can avoid this fate by pressing the back arrow in the top left until you reach the main part of a layer. Once you are there, you can take the habitation option for your layer to avoid death.

Your days of water remaining count has gone below -2, indicating that you managed to survive without water for a few days, but eventually died of dehydration. If you didn't realize what had happened, you can avoid this fate by pressing the back arrow in the top left until you reach the main part of a layer. Once you are there, you can take the habitation option for your layer to avoid death.
<<endif>><<if $corruption < 0>>

Due to your negative corruption, you are unable to accept a habitation option at this time. However, you can go back to the main part of the layer, then take curses until you have reached a corruption above 0 to survive. This is highly reccomended if you wish to avoid death.

:: BrokerEnd
YOU MAY NOT ALLOW YOUR CORRUPTION TO GO BELOW 0 DUE TO YOUR BROKER'S DEAL.

You have chosen to accept the deal of the Empty-handed Broker and attempted to take an action that would reduce your corruption points below 0. Because this is not possible, you must go back to avoid performing this action.

If you would still like to perform this action, you may go back to the main part of the layer you were on and accept curses to raise your corruption point total.

<<say $mc>> You know, we're traveling together in one of the most dangerous places in the world, yet I know almost nothing about you. Do you want to tell me anything about yourself?<</say>><br>

<<endif>>

<<if $choice1==1>>
<<say $mc>>Could you tell me something about your childhood?<</say>><br>

<<say companion1>> Well, I was mostly raised by my big sister. She was nice, but not exactly the most gentle person ever. Maybe overprotective would be a better way to describe it. When I was younger I wasn't really allowed to play outside or do anything that might be too rough. Sometimes it was a lttle annoying, but I understand why she was doing it.<</say>><br>

<<say $mc>>I can imagine that was a little tough.<</say>><br>

<<say companion1>>Yeah, but it wasn't all bad. I think she was just looking out for me, since I am the youngest. We were a very tight family, so we did a lot of stuff with each other. And in a way it forced me to learn to cook and sow as well, since I wanted to do things with my sister.<</say>><br>

<<say $mc>> Is that also the reason why you are wearing feminine clothing? Were they forcing you to do this?<</say>><br>

<<say companion1>> No! No, nothing like that. As a child I think I looked pretty feminine.  Well, even more than now I mean. My sisters liked to play dress-up with me, and I actually liked it too. Sometimes I thought that I shouldn't be doing it, but eventually I realized that if it makes me happy, then there's no reason I should stop.<</say>><br>

He pauses for a moment as he seems to gather his thoughts.<br><br>

<<say companion1>> Over time I really began to appreciate how well my sisters cared for me. I don't know if it's the same for everyone, but I was glad they accepted what I liked and we could do things together and be happy.<</say>><br>

You ponder his story for a bit.<br><br>
<<say $mc>> Thanks for sharing that with me. How are your sisters doing?<</say>><br>

His expression falls, and he looks down in silence for a few seconds before responding. <br><br>
<<say companion1>>They all left.<</say>><br>

After a few more moments he forces a smile and continues. <br><br>
<<say companion1>> Anyway, don't let your meal get cold!<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>Oh, sure, thanks for the meal!<</say>><br>
As you take in the food, you realize it takes shockingly good for something made with such limited ingredients. How did he manage to get the texture just right and the flavors perfectly balanced all the way down here? Maru giggles as he looks at you eating his food.<br><br>
<<say companion1>> Well, if you like it this much, I'll be sure to make it like this more often!<</say>><br>
Every 10 days, Maru will make a meal with 1 day worth of food that will keep you satisified for 2 days, saving you 1 day of food rations!<br>

<<say $mc>>I don't really get it. I thought it would be more of a story, but I guess everybody has their strange quirks.<</say>><br>
Maru looks a bit downward. He opens his mouth as if to say something before closing it again. After a moment he replies.<br>
<<say companion1>> Yeah, I guess so...<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>Anyway, as long as you keep cooking these delicious meals, you won't hear me complaining about whatever you want to wear while you cook them!<</say>><br>
<<say companion1>> Well, uh, thanks, I guess.<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>Huh?<</say>><br>

<<say $companion1>> Uh, thanks, I guess?<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>Did I say something wrong?<</say>><br>
<<say $companion1>> No, no, not at all. I was just a bit suprised that that was your question, since I thought you wanted to ask something about me, but I'm really happy that you like it!<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>>Like it? It's absolutely delicious!<</say>><br>

Maru tells you in detail how he prepared the dish. It's actually pretty simple, but he added some herbs with subtle flavors which seem to have a made a big difference in the final product. And his cooking method was precise to ensure the texture ended up perfect!<br>

Every 10 days, Maru will make a meal with 1 day worth of food that will keep you satisified for 2 days, saving you 1 day of food rations!<br>

She releases her grip on you and smiles widely. <br><br>
<<say $companion2>>I didn't expect such a warm welcome, but hey I'm not complaining! Especially from such a cute <<PerceivedGender>>.<</say>><br>

She winks at you and grins as she finishes her comment. You weren't sure if you were going for the cute vibe, but at the very least you want to be taken seriously as an adventurer. But on the other hand, it's good that your new teammate likes you, you suppose.<br><br>

	<<say $companion2>>Oh my, we only just met and you already know what to say to get my engine running!<</say>><br>

Lily steps forward to approach you, and it almost seems like she's leaning in for a kiss. But before you can react, you suddenly feel a hard pat on your back and open your eyes to see Lily with the widest grin possible.<br><br>

	<<say $companion2>>But let's not jump the gun here <<mrms>> cassanova. We have a whole adventure ahead of us to get to know eachother better.<</say>><br>

	<<say $companion2>>Haha! Don't worry about it <<mrms>> hero. I can take pretty good care of myself. But I'll be sure to let you know just in case I find some other damsel in distress you can save.<</say>><br>

She starts snicker at her own joke. You're not quite sure if it's a joke at your expense though. Regardless, she seems to be in good spirits and that's what's important in the end, right?<br><br>

	Flustered, you find yourself at a loss for words and can't find a response quickly enough.<br><br>

	<<say $companion2>>Yeah, maybe I do know? Well, I guess I am an awfully cute little angel, right?<</say>><br>

<<say $companion2>>Oh, so formal! But I guess that's fine.<</say>><br>

	<<say $companion2>>Well thank you for asking <<mrms>> boss <<PerceivedGender>>. My hobbies include listening to pop music and traveling. I've traveled to lots of countries around the world already! What can I say? I'm just the adventurous type, I guess. <</say>><br>

You mimic her tone and play along.<br><br>

	<<say $mc>> Ah yes, excellent to hear that miss Lily, what would you say your...<</say>><br>

Before you can finish your sentence, she interrupts you.<br><br>

	<<say $companion2>>Oh, and anime too! The best thing is if I can combine both! I once travelled half way around the world for this awesome anime convention. You wouldn't believe the cute little snacks they had over there... <</say>><br>

	In the end Lily rambles on for quite a while about her various travels, what anime see likes, what songs she like, and what anime songs she likes. Even if you can't quite follow all of her stories, she seems happy as long as you make an effort and nod along.<br>

<<say $mc>>I'm glad to have you on board! I'm $mc.name<</say>><br>

When you look at her there is no sign of emotion, he expression seems totally blank. <br><br>

	<<say $companion4>>Look, I'm sorry if I came across as rude. It's just that... I'm not really that excited to go down, but I'll do what I must.<</say>><br>

	For a second you seem to spot a small smile creep up on Cherry, but in an instant it vanishes.<br><br>

	<<say $companion5>>Or maybe you can try one of those surprise hugs on the shopkeeper, and we can see if you'll get enough of a discount to afford everything we need. Ha ha ha!<</say>><br>

	You can't help but crack up a little at the absurdity of the proposal.<br><br>

	<<say $mc>>Ha ha, sure, but you had better not complain about not being special if I can get a discount on my own like that!<</say>><br>

:: Cloud Convo1 [noreturn]
<<nobr>>
As you were walking, Cloud suddenly sprints ahead a few meters and kneels by the side of the road. When you walk over, you see him hunched over a body with multiple injuries which seem to be bullet wounds, or maybe stab wounds?<br><br>
<<say $mc>> What do you think happened to him? Do you think it could have been the bandits we were warned about earlier?<</say>><br>
<<say $companion5>> Hard to say for sure, but it it were bandits, they were either cruel or simple amateurs, who wouldn't pose a real threat to us.<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>> What makes you say that? <</say>><br>
Cloud points to a spot on the back of the corpse.<br><br>
<<say $companion5>> Look, here. He was shot in the back. <</say>>
You see cloud moving the body onto its belly to point at a gunshot wound in the upper back. <br><br>
<<say $companion5>> But it seems off target, if you look at the angle of entry and the trauma around the shoulders, the bullet is probably lodged in there somewhere near the shoulder blades.<</say>><br>
He then pushes the body onto its back and points at the other wounds.<br><br>
<<say $companion5>> And these are stab wounds, but every single one missed a vital organ. Based on the amount of blood here, my guess is that he bled out in the end after managing to get away at first.<</say>><br>
<<say $mc>> That sounds pretty gruesome, why would they do that to him? <</say>><br>
<<say $companion5>> Indeed, it must have been. Check his bag. If my guess is right, we might be able to find something useful. <</say>><br>

<<say $companion5>> So not cruel, just amateurs then, good to know. Okay, put it away and let's move on. <</say>><br>

Alas, those days are long gone and now I must work to change things in the world above so that all people can have true freedom, without fear of governments or bandits.</say>><br>

You have to be willing to get your hands dirty and do what it takes to get an advantage here. We didn't hurt him and its not like he'll be using the coins any more, right? We might as well make use of anything we can to make sure we survive. With the way the world is right now, that's what you have to do to survive.<</say>><br>
He opens the pack on the ground, pulls out a few dubloons and tosses them your way. <br><br>

	<<say $mc>>Yeah, I'm excited to discover all the magical wonders the Abyss has in store for us!<</say>><br>

	She cocks an eyebrow as a response.<br><br>
	<<say $companion6>>Magical wonders? You don't seem to understand the gravity of what we will be encountering in the Abyss. It is not that there are simply a series of 'magical' wondrous things that we can enjoy, it is an apparent gap in our understanding of the rules of the universe. Even the simplest of the Relics or Wonders we will observe in the Abyss simply break the rules that humans have held dear for hundreds of years. We need to rethink everything that we know about the universe. But they do follow their own rules, so they can be scientifically studied.<</say>><br>

	Saeko seems to be getting more invested now, she begins speaking more enthusiastically about Abyssal research.<br><br>

	<<say $companion6>>And while I don't expect to immediately understand why the Abyss does what it does, I think we can at least understand how it works on a surface level. How does Miasma alter developmental processes? How long have the species in the Abyss been evolving? Can we make use of the mutational effects of the miasma intentionally in a controlled manner, perhaps cure medical conditions? The potential is nearly limitless and we need to see what we can learn from it.<</say>><br>
	Saeko continues to talk about recent advances in research regarding the Abyss and the immense potential that the Abyss has, if we could only understand it well enough to use it. You don't get much of a chance to speak, but it is very informative.<br>

	<<elseif $choice2==2>>
	<<say $mc>>Yeah, I'm thrilled to delve into all the mysteries the Abyss holds!<</say>><br>

	You see a twinkle in her eyes and the edges of her lips curl upwards. <br><br>
	<<say $companion6>>Me too! I actually have a new theory about the effects of miasma on the flora and fauna native to the Abyss. I hypothesize that while some organisms display the effects of an acute mutation due to miasma exposure, others show an evolution over a long period of time in the Abyss. And I think if we can identify which species have evolved in the Abyss, then we can identify their most recent common ancestor with known surface species. If we do that, we can get a better understanding of what changes long-term colonization of the Abyss had on them and even when the species diverged!<</say>><br>
	She blushes a bit, noticing she may be getting a bit carried away.<br><br>
	<<say $companion6>>But yeah, you might not want to hear all about it. I understand. Suffice to say that I think there is a lot we can learn and I'm quite interested in learning it.<</say>><br>
	<<say $mc>>No, please continue! I don't know if I'll be completely able to understand, but maybe it could be useful for the trip.<</say>><br>

	Saeko smiles widely and perks up at your interest.<br><br>

	<<say $companion6>>Well, if you say so. Anyway, I think that if we can see the common ancestors of Abyssal species to surface species, then we can create bounds on the age of the Abyss. Like if the flairabou of the 4th layer diverged from a surface mammal 500,000 years ago, then we can conclude the Abyss must be at least 500,000 years old. That's just an example, I haven't analyzed the flairabou yet. Though I hypothesize the oldest diverging species may be on the lower levels, so if we don't go deep enough then we won't be able to put an upper bound on the age of the Abyss. <</say>><br>

	<<say $companion6>>And also, we may be able to learn about how the Abyss alters the evolution of the species within. If we raised a flairabou outside the Abyss, would it have the same properties or does it rely on the miasma of the Abyss to mutate its body in a certain way to stay alive? Do we need to worry about Dune Devouring Borers colonizing the Sahara if someone brought them to the surface? Right now, no one knows, but I think these are important questions to ask and I hope that further analysis of Abyssal flora and fauna can provide answers to these questions.<</say>><br>
	Saeko continues her explanation for a while, posing more questions, hypotheses, and experiments she'd like to do to test them. You can't quite follow everything she says, as she's clearly a better researcher than teacher, but she's glad you're paying attention and tries to explain anything you ask about.<br><br>

Even though you meant it as a joke, you see no sign of her dropping her professional demeanor.<br><br>

	<<say $mc>> Very good, what is your ambition for this field expedition?<</say>><br>

		<<say $companion6>>I'm very glad you asked! I actually have a new theory about the effects of miasma on the flora and fauna native to the Abyss, and I'm looking to obtain data to test my hypotheses. I hypothesize that while some organisms display the effects of an acute mutation due to miasma exposure, others show an evolution over a long period of time in the Abyss. And I think if we can identify which species have evolved in the Abyss, then we can identify their most recent common ancestor with known surface species. If we do that, we can get a better understanding of what changes long-term colonization of the Abyss had on them and even when the species diverged!<</say>><br>
	She blushes a bit, noticing she may be getting a bit carried away.<br><br>
	<<say $companion6>>But yeah, you might not want to hear all about it. I understand. Suffice to say that I think there is a lot we can learn and I'm quite interested in learning it.<</say>><br>
	<<say $mc>>No, please continue! I don't know if I'll be completely able to understand, but maybe it could be useful for the trip.<</say>><br>

	Saeko smiles widely and perks up at your interest.<br><br>

	<<say $companion6>>Well, if you say so. Anyway, I think that if we can see the common ancestors of Abyssal species to surface species, then we can create bounds on the age of the Abyss. Like if the flairabou of the 4th layer diverged from a surface mammal 500,000 years ago, then we can conclude the Abyss must be at least 500,000 years old. That's just an example, I haven't analyzed the flairabou yet. Though I hypothesize the oldest diverging species may be on the lower levels, so if we don't go deep enough then we won't be able to put an upper bound on the age of the Abyss. <</say>><br>

	<<say $companion6>>And also, we may be able to learn about how the Abyss alters the evolution of the species within. If we raised a flairabou outside the Abyss, would it have the same properties or does it rely on the miasma of the Abyss to mutate its body in a certain way to stay alive? Do we need to worry about Dune Devouring Borers colonizing the Sahara if someone brought them to the surface? Right now, no one knows, but I think these are important questions to ask and I hope that further analysis of Abyssal flora and fauna can provide answers to these questions.<</say>><br>
	Saeko continues her explanation for a while, posing more questions, hypotheses, and experiments she'd like to do to test them. You can't quite follow everything she says, as she's clearly a better researcher than teacher, but she's glad you're paying attention and tries to explain anything you ask about.<br><br>

While she doesn't seem great at picking up on sarcasm sometimes, you found your conversation very friendly and she seems to have appreciated your interest.<br><br>

		<<say $mc>>Uh, of course! So um, what do you think you can contribute to the expedition? <</say>><br>

Deeper than layer 5 no one knows much of anything, and in some layers even with knowledge there's no perfectly safe food or water. And, uh, I have stuff for some nice tea if you want some I suppose.<</say>><br>

:: Kin Shifter Use [noreturn]
[img[setup.ImagePath+"Relics/kinshifter.png"]]

A glob of thick, putty-like slime. the face appears decorative. When touched to another relic that you own, a portion of the slime will break off and reshape itself into a perfect replica of that Relic, gaining all of its characteristics, abilities, value, and weight permanently. It cannot shift back to its original form. The amount that breaks off is dependent on the perceived value of the Relic, which can be measured with its dubloon value. The slime contains 70 dubloons worth of morphing power, and can be used on multiple Relics with that total value or less - however, the last Relic that is duplicated can put you over the 70 dubloon total, so long as that Relic is worth 70 dublooms or less. This Relic can also copy Relics woth over 70 dubloons, but in that case that Relic would have to be the sole Relic that you copy.

Some examples: A : (20)->(30)->(20) = total 70, done.

B: (20)->(30)->(40) = total 90, over 70, done.

C: (120) done, only possible configuration for duplicating a Relic worth this much.

:: Forbidden Grimoire Use
[img[setup.ImagePath+"Relics/forbiddengrimoire.png"]]
<<nobr>>
<<if $temp1 == 0>>
A grisly-looking ragged book written in an indecipherable language. Words can only be seen on the page when a person reads it alone, and they vanish as that one person reads them. This will take whatever skills the reader possesses and improve them greatly, leaving a blank, non-useful book behind. Mechanically speaking, if you let a companion use it, it would double the specific numeric benefit of their special ability - Khemia would reduce travel costs by 4 days, Cloud would redduce bullet costs by 4 (minimum 1), Cherry would reduce status effect lengths by2, and so on. (It doesn't really affect, say, Khemia's ability to slay monsters so much - he's already trained to nearly the maximum human limits, and if there's a monster he can't defeat, it's more about the monster simply being durable beyond the human body's limits than it is about any imperfections in his fighting sills.) Using it on yourself could help you in your normal life, but probably not very much on your journey - the benefit would be substantially less than that from using it on a companion, anyways. If one person were to read it twice (such as through Kin Shifter), the second use would have no benefit - best to spread it out among multiple companions.<br><br>
It's useless once it's been used once of course, so choose wisely who will get the benefit.<br><br>
