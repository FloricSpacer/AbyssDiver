:: Opportunistic Bandits Description

Here in the shallows, it's not beasts of the Abyss you need to worry about, but rather other divers. You can always count on people trying to make a quick profit by hanging around and trying to steal the hard-earned Relics of others. They have guns and various normal tools purchased from the same shop as you, but no Relics or special abilities of note. You'll find a new group of them waiting for you whenever you emerge from a lower layer carrying Relics worth a total of 150 dubloons or more. They don't want to kill you if they don't need to, they just want your loot.

Two warning shots from a pistol would be adequate for them to decide you're not worth it and leave you alone. You could use more to kill them, but there will always be other bandits later on and doing so offers no material benefit. (If you tried looting them, you'd only find rusted hand-me-down guns that look like they could backfire at any moment, bullets that look like they've been reused when they really shouldn't have been, and
"rations" that seem to be mostly garbage. They're equipped well-enough to be a threat to unprepared travelers, but woefully unprepared for anything else the Abyss could throw at them. You kind of feel bad for these bandits?)

Khemia with a sword could also deal with them easily, or you could try leaving lots of Relics behind while you escape with a couple of them, if you're desperate. They'll deem you too risky and leave you alone altogether if you're traveling in a group of 4 or more.

:: Baying Gourmet Description

A large quadruped beast with a very powerful nose and an insatiable curiosity. It often tracks travelers by the scent of their food from the surface, and no matter how they try to change the formula or mask the scent, the molecular gastronomists in Outset Town have never managed to create any kind of rations that can fool their powerful noses. Every 4 consecutive days in this layer that you spend carrying 10 or more days' worth of food rations from the surface. youâ€™ll he set upon and attacked by one.

They're strong and sturdy beasts, but they fall easily to human weapons. Even amateurish use of a sword, or being shot 3 times with a pistol, would be adequate to deal with them. If fighting isn't your style, you can pacify them by giving them 5 days of food rations. They'll also simply avoid you altogether if you're in a group of 5 or more people.

If you can't put up that kind of resistance, it will overpower you, and when curiosity gets the better of it, begin to rape you. Being a wild beast, it is anything but gentle, and it will leave you with a mild limp - "status condition." This will increase your next 4 travel time costs by 1 day each. Remember that this can be cured immediately by expending a medkit.

:: Lesser Tentacle Beast Description

A squirming mass of tentacles that wants nothing more than to viciously probe every nook and cranny you have. You'll run into one every 6 consecutive days you spend in this layer.

Their amorphous, resilient form and lack of obvious weak points makes bullets a less-than-effective option - you would need no less than 11 bullets to dispatch a single beast. Cloud is much more practiced with dealing with them, so he will reduce the bullet requirement by <<if $hiredCompanions.some(e => e.id === setup.companionIds.cloud)>><<print ($bullRed * 3)>> bullets, rather than the typical $bullRed<<else>>3 times his normal bullet cost reduction<</if>>. Swords are effective, but without Khemia's expertise you'll be left with mild injuries, increasing your next 3 travel time costs by 2 days each, unless you use up a medkit to heal yourself.

Without any form of resistance, you'll receive a very thorough tentacle fucking, leaving you with a serious limp, doubling your next 3 travel time costs (or increasing them by 2 days, whichever is longer) unless you use up a medkit. However, the lesser tentacle seems to be slightly more gentle with creatures it can impregnate, so if you have the Omnitool Curse, the injury will only increase your next 2 travel times by 1 day each. However, giving birth to tentacle spawn isn't the most pleasant experience, so it's not necessarily recommended.

:: Slackslime Description

A strange unicellular colonial organism that grows throughout the caves, often appearing where you would least expect it. Every 5 consecutive days you spend in the caves without a source of light, you'll inadvertently stumble into one, at which point it will release a strong paralytic gas that will easily seep through your skin and quickly render you completely immobile, preserving only vital organ functions. Over the next 2 days it will slowly squirm around and inside your most sensitive areas, to harvest protein from your sexual fluids. Whether a companion is caught in the gas with you or not, attempting to move you while the slime is feeding would be hazardous both to your health and your companions.

Your death would be counterproductive to this process, so it will force-feed you food and water that you're carrying at an appropriate pace, starting with food purchased with dubloons before moving on to foraged food. Make sure you carry enough to sustain yourself during the process, or you could actually be in fatal danger here!

It will release you after the 2 days are up, squirming away before the paralytic agent wears off. The counter for days before you run into a Lesser Tentacle Beast or another Slackslime won't increment while you're trapped. The counter also resets if you leave the layer and come back. If you have the Gooey Curse, it will sense a kind of camaraderie in you and let you go 1 day earlier. They're notoriously hard to kill, but slow enough to be essentially harmless so long as you have a source of light to guide you.

:: Drifting Swallower Description

A large, floating beast that moves through the air with buoyant, gas-filled sacs. It finds prey by using its tail and powerful appendages to sense vibrations from even the slightest movement, and is capable of using its appendages for quick, sudden movements by grabbing surfaces and throwing itself forward. Many unwitting travelers have ended up as lunch for one of these terrifying beasts.

You'll run into one every 7 consecutive days you spend in this layer.

You could bring one of these down with 5 bullets. As they float out of reach until they're ready to swoop in for a bite, melee attacks are a very poor choice for dealing with them. Khemia could just barely figure out a way with a sword, but would be left with serious injuries, increasing the next 6 travel times by 1 day each.

If you're unable to put up a suitable resistance, prepare to be vored! You'll spend 3 days being tickled and lightly burned by gastric juices lapping at your most sensitive spots. The walls of its stomach are surprisingly strong, and it's even harder to successfully damage from the inside than it is from the outside. The experience is not fatal (as long as you have food and water to sustain yourself in its stomach), but probably not pleasant unless you're a pervert. After the creature eventually expels you, you'll be left with light burns, increasing all travel costs by 1 day until cured, and youâ€™ll meet another Drifting Swallower 7 days after that point. This won't heal on its own; you need to expend a medkit.

:: Spectre of the End Description

After visiting this layer, travelers often report experiencing the feeling of something constantly watching them, slowly creeping closer. Public knowledge has generally discounted this as paranoia, triggered by the stress of being so far from civilization, or perhaps just something in the air of this layer. Wait long enough, though, and you'll get to decide for yourself exactly how real it is.

It will start following you after you set foot in this layer, and it won't leave until you decide to settle down - in other words, until you choose a Habitation option. It will always stay just out of sight, and doesn't appear to be material or capable of interacting with the rest of the world in any way. Exactly 900 days after it starts following you, it will finally reach you, without fail, and with a touch it will both give you the greatest orgasm of your life and bring about your death. It will follow you into other layers, and cannot be avoided or defeated except by ending your quest. Even as it reaches out to touch you, nobody else will see anything out of the ordinary. It doesn't go after those with the purity gene.

:: Mayfly Scuttler Description

Not actually related to the mayfly (and being morphologically something between a scarab and a locust), these bugs got their popular name from their extremely brief and turbulent life cycle. After a 7 day hibernation period (which you always seem to enter this layer right at the beginning of), they hatch and immediately begin swarming the layer, painting the sky red with billions of the beetles mating, fighting, and releasing copious pheromones and aphrodisiacs.

Whether you go outside and inadvertently become a participant in the violent and sexual festivities make sure to bring food and water. or find shelter in one of the ruins, the end result is the same: you'll be unable to make any progress on your tourney for the duration of that entire day. After they finish mating, the cycle will begin anew, and theyâ€™ll mate again in 7 days.

If you would try to combat them, youâ€™ll have to think outside the box. Traditional weapons wont work on a swarm this big. with targets so tiny. You could prevent yourself from becoming an aphrodisiac-addled mess if you can avoid breathing in the air somehow, but the sheer number of the insects and the injures youâ€™d receive from them would still slow you down significantly. They'd be a bit more gentle if you had at least 3/4 of the Curses from the bottom row of this layer's Curse section, though. The opposite would be true if you have 3/4 of the Curses from the third row, as large portions of the bugs would attempt to swarm you and "pollinate" you. Probably best to just stay indoors during the festivities and be a wallflower, if you've taken Curses that turned you into an actual flower.

:: Booby Traps Description

Hehe, booby.

Every Relic in this layer is found in one of the many ruins that are carved into the landscape, and in keeping with the architectural theme seen throughout this layer, they're all guarded by complex and dangerous traps. Whoever built these traps was certain clever about them - you'll run into a tripwire right where you'd normally expect a pressure plate, question why these ancient-looking ruins appear to have some kind of laser-light sensors, and sometimes see traps seemingly activate on their own with no action on your part. In any case, avoiding them altogether just by being careful isn't practical, and you'll see one every time you try to take a Relic from this layer.

To be specific, Relics on the left column of this layer's Relic section will activate a boulder trap that youâ€™ll have to run down a long hallway to escape from, Relics in the middle column will send a barrage of arrows at you, and those in the right column will drop you through a trapdoor into a room with scorpions. Without any particular preparation, you'll be able to just barely escape all these traps with serious injuries, increasing all travel times by 3 days until they're healed with a medkit. If you want to avoid those injuries, you'll have to come up with a plan using the resources you have. You can get accustomed to the traps somewhat, however - on your third experience with a single type of trap (third Relic from a single column) and after that, youâ€™ll have enough experience with that type of trap to avoid any injuries from it, even without planning.

However, you won't be able to escape the traps if you're already weakened - the traps are fatal if you already have any status condition, so don't try your luck with the Relics here if you do!

:: Dune Devouring Borer Description

The territorial, extremely aggressive apex predator of this layer, an enormous worm-like creature that tunnels through sand and stone alike with no apparent effort. It is attracted to water, and you'll find yourself face-to-face with one whenever you spend 9 consecutive days in this layer carrying 11 or more days' worth of water.

Its poorly-understood biology, lack of obvious weak points, hard-as-steel exoskeleton, and harder-than-titanium teeth would make confronting it a foolish idea. Bullets would simply bounce right off, even Khemia won't be able to pierce its unfathomably hard flesh unless using the Sunbeam Relic, and though he could win using it, he'd need to stop for 1 day to recover from his injuries unless you use a medkit. It's far too fast and maneuverable for simply running away.

to be an option. unless you sacrifice no less than 10 days of water as a distraction. A steep price, but it would be the safest way of dealing with these monstrosities. Attempting an other kind of resistance without powerful Relics and a good plan would almost certainly lead to a rather realistic example of vore, and subsequent death. The presence of these beasts means that leaving water unattended in this layer in any form is impractical, and it will be gone when you return.

:: Greater Tentacle Beast Description

A later stage of the Tentacle Beast species, having grown to a colossal size. They thrive in this layer, easily blending in with the landscape, and it's very easy to completely overlook them until they're already underfoot, ready to spring up and surround you. You'll run into one every 15 consecutive days you spend in this layer.

Letting one of these sate its lust with you is incredibly dangerous; it'll inject you with powerful numbing liquids so you won't feel the pain while it ravages you. It might be incredibly pleasurable at the time, but the state it leaves your body in afterwards is dangerous down here. After being tentacle fucked, you'll be completely unable to move for 12 days, unless you use a medkit.

Guns really aren't the most effective solution for something this huge and amorphous. Without any special considerations, it would take no less than 19 bullets to bring one of these beasts down. But the sheer number of tentacles you'd be dealing with makes melee combat incredibly dangerous, too. If you're relying on amateur swordplay, you'll barely be able to put up a resistance to it at all, and it'll have plenty of time to play with your body while you're trying to hack away at its tentacles - the duration of being tentacle fucked would be 10 days instead of 12, as you'd be able to finish it off a little sooner. You can reduce that to 9 if you're using the Sunbeam Relic. (The resilience of this beast is primarily from its sheer size, not from any kind of hard shell.) Even Khemia wouldn't be totally safe, and he'd get the tentacle fucked status condition for 2 days, or 1 with Sunbeam.

:: Hexflame Fields Description

The numerous tentacles that make up most of the land here would merely be an arousing annoyance, were it not for the shadowy, grimly-colored flames that many are shrouded in. A mechanism meant to encourage prey to give in to their slothful feelings and stay here where the tentacles may continue feeding on their juices, these flames cause only a mild, tickling discomfort while you're in this layer, but show their true colors as soon as you step foot outside this layer, causing debilitating pain and a feeling of being burned.

The flames are so numerous and travel so quickly that it is near-impossible to travel through this tangled jungle of tentacles without walking through them, and you'll gain 1 jinxed flame counter for every day you spend in this layer. This status effect is unique in that it cannot be healed with a medkit or the doctors in Outset Town; you will need to wait for the effects to go away on their own - so it would probably be wise to be hasty in this layer and accumulate as few flame counters as possible.

The counters won't have any notable effect while you're here in layer 6, but they'll activate whenever you're in any other layer. The painful feeling of burning will slow your movements, increasing travel times - and it only gets worse the more counters you have. All travel times will be increased by X days, where X-the number of jinxed flame counters you have/10, rounded up. So 1-10 counters adds one day, 11-20 adds two, 21-30 adds three, and so on. Having jinxed flame counters also increases the corruption costs of all options outside this layer by 5 times that same value X while you have them. The number of flame counters attached to you will be decreased by 1 for every day you spend outside layer 6.

Having the Cellulose Curse will make this slightly more painful, but with no extra mechanical impact. Cherry has no effect on the duration of the jinxed flame counters.

:: Fell Dragon Description

A proud, enormous dragon with hardened scales, sharp claws that could easily rend a person in two, and flame breath nearly hot enough to melt solid stone. Consumed by greed, these dragons hoard large piles of gold that they defend violently from anyone who draws near.

Every 8 consecutive days you spend in this layer carrying 200 dubloons or more, you'll draw the envy of one of them, and it will attack you to steal your gold for itself. Bullets won't work, and neither will conventional swords; its scales are just too hard. Don't just go running at it with the Sunbeam Relic and assume everything will be okay either; these things are fast, vicious, and cunning. Khemia could just barely manage it if equipped with the Sunbeam, but he'd be left with moderate burns, increasing all travel times by 2 until healed with a medkit. News of the battle will quickly spread to other Fell Dragons, and they'll adapt enough that Khemia with Sunbeam alone won't be enough a second time. In fact, you should probably be changing your strategy somewhat with every new Fell Dragon you fight, or they'll quickly adapt and render your old strategies useless.

While dangerous and unpredictable, you can always count on one of their hoards being nearby when you see one. Take the risk of fighting G and defeating one, and you'll be rewarded with a stash of 50 dubloons. (However, if you somehow successfully triumph over 5 Fell Dragons and steal their troves, you'll find that the rest of the Fell Dragons will give you a wide berth, and you won't find any of them or their treasure from that point onwards.)

You could appease the wrath of one of them by giving it 100 dubloons, and it would graciously let you keep the rest and leave you alone for a time. You could also try to keep all your dubloons and run like heck from one, though you'd be left with severe burns, doubling all travel times until manually healed and requiring two medkits to heal. This isn't an option if you have the Cellulose Curse; you'd be burnt to a crisp.

Don't leave dubloons lying around in this layer, or these dragons will sniff them out and steal them.

:: Taxdrone Version Number 53X Description

Even though it's safe to say you're probably not a legal citizen of this city, it seems the automated systems in place still fully expect you to pay taxes while you're here. If you don't place your dally taxes in one of the specially-marked boxes you can find on nearly every street corner, one of these robots will fly down to you and demand that day's taxes in a monotone, droning voice. If you refuse to pay, or the city's systems detect even the slightest abnormality in the Taxdrone sent down to you, you'll be marked an "active criminal" by the city, which is really not good. You'll have thousands of attack robots with all manner of lasers, buzzsaws, photon swords, and bombs immediately congregating on your location, surrounding you from all directions and single-mindedly hunting you down, as though you were an infection being eliminated by robotic macrophages. Making this entire layer your enemy probably isn't impossible to survive, but it is an absolutely terrible idea.

You'd think that taxes would be designed to balance out wealth by taxing the rich more so than the poor, but not in this capitalistic cyberpunk dystopia! Tax brackets are as follows:

â—¦	If you're carrying under 100 dubloons, you'll need to pay 3 dubloons a day.
â—¦	With 100-299 dubloons, you'd need to pay 2 each day.
â—¦	And with over 300 dubloons, you'd only need to pay 1 per day.

Money is your life in this city. Make sure you always have at least 3 dubloons on hand whenever the Taxdrone comes for you!

:: Security Robot Model 5318008 Description

A huge, building-sized robot designed to capture unauthorized intruders in the city, which you are.

Every 6 consecutive days you spend in this layer, one of them will stop and detain you, leaving you in a cell located in its robotic shell, where for 1 entire day it will play various blaring propaganda recordings designed to indoctrinate you on your place in society and "rehabilitate" you, with various strange perverted robotic undertones. You won't be harmed during the process, but it'll be annoying and slow the first time, and it'll only be more boring every new time you're detained. Note that you're expected to pay taxes even while captured, so make sure you have enough dubloons to make up for that lost day! (Plus food and water, since they tend to forget about the needs of organics.) If you show any kind of resistance or any abnormality is detected in this robot, you'll become public enemy #1 for the robots in this city, the same situation you'd be in for not paying your taxes. After it releases you, it will visit you again 6 days afterwards.

This could actually be a credible threat if you have the Hypno Happytime Curse! Unless you have a good plan for avoiding all their conditioning, they'll get their hooks deep in you by the 5th time you're detained, forcing you into this layer's habitation option.

If you're part of the 1% and you're carrying over 500 dubloons, you'll find the Security Robots won't bother you anymore. Everyone knows that rich people can't be criminals, right?

:: Inanis Ego Description

After first laying eyes on one of these mute, empty-eyed dolls and their shambling, clockwork movements, you were overcome with a profound sense of dÃ©jÃ  vÃ©cu. It wasn't quite clear why at first glance, but the more you look at them. the more their faces seem to resolve into something recognizable, something familiar. These dolls are you. Not figuratively, and not as part of an illusion.

Perhaps having taken a different path than you did, having different injuries, different hair styles, different Curses that you can't imagine yourself as having taken - some with odd pairs of ears, some smaller or taller, some with sexual equipment differing from yours in both shape and size - but they were all, at one point in their past, you. Nobody else. As you look at them, a thousand different mockeries. corruptions of your own face, stare back. though behind their eves is something entirely foreign, merely the shattered pieces of a mind that was once yours glued back together.

They're slow, and they seem predictable, at first. On your first day in this layer you'll spot one marching slowly towards you as though pulled by a puppeteer's strings, and it'll be easily dispatched with a single slash of a sword or a bullet to the head. But the next day the exact same doll you assumed dead will be back, now joined by a second, and the third day you'll have three following you. Their numbers will keep increasing limitlessly with every day you spend here, and even if you leave this layer, the counter will be right where you left it if you return. Your companions, thankfully, don't get any of their own doppelgangers.

They seem to get smarter over time, too. On the 10th day one might surprise you by waiting in ambush as you round a corner. On the 30th, you'll see them start performing semi-coordinated pincer attacks to try to cut off any possible escape route. Around day 70 a few of them might rarely even be carrying some Relics and attempting to make use of them to reach you - starting with weak, nigh-useless Relics, but slowly getting more powerful ones as time goes on. Stay here until day 100 and you'll be contending with intelligence perfectly equal to your own, just in much slower, weaker bodies. It would be quite egotistical to assume you could even defeat a few handfuls of them when theyâ€™re your intellectual equals. let alone over a hundred ot them. Use extreme caution around them after that point.

Each fight against them is somewhat unpredictable, but your chances increase as your combat strength improves. So if you have more companions, better weapons, and useful Relics, you'll be able to hold out much longer. Whereas if you have handicaps from Curses, you're not likely to last very long against their onslaught.

If one of them is able to forcibly kiss you on the lips (or the closest equivalent if you no longer have them, or they're otherwise inaccessible) for 5 seconds, they'll become you, inserting themselves into your life with all your relationships and traveling companions, being free to leave this layer and take all that was previously yours, all while still smiling an empty smile. You'll become one of them, trapped in this layer forever. until time loses all meaning. See this layer's Habitation option.

:: Demential Aberrations Description

Spending time in this layer subtly but inexorably erodes the barrier between the real and the imaginary. Being this far removed from civilization while constantly living in fear of death is already quite bad for your mental health, but something about these corridors, stretching into infinity, folding into themselves, vanishing and appearing again - it just removes the last leg your brain had left to stand on. Every 7 consecutive days you're in this layer, you'll find yourself assaulted by terrible, nightmarish abominations; the creatures living beneath your subconscious, any sleep paralysis demons you might have had, those tiny nagging doubts that there's something watching you in the dark - and these will be persistent enough to completely prevent any kind of productive progress from being made on your quest that day.

Except the third time (after 21 days), they'll be real, and physically very capable of injuring or killing you and your companions, and/or giving you the weirdest, scariest fucking you could ever possibly receive. The monsters living in your companions heads will all come out to play too, making this Threat unique in that it can actually get more dangerous the more companions you have with you. You'd probably be better off fighting each others' Aberrations rather than your own, as they'll have less of a mental hold over you, but this probably won't be practical for the less combat-oriented members in your group. Keep plenty of weapons, escape routes, and failsafes. These creatures are born of your own unconscious thoughts, and so they will frequently know what you plan to do even before you do - it might feel like they're reading your mind at times, until you remember that they are your mind... or a part of it, anyways.

The cycle will repeat after the third time - two fake, one real, two fake, one real...try not to stay in this layer longer than you have to, these things are really bad for your head. It's all the way down here that Maru's secret special companion ability is finally revealed! His calming presence, great cooking, and gentle demeanor improves the group's mental state slightly, increasing the length of every cycle by 1, to 8 days instead of 7. He's just doing his best.

:: The Elder Description

Before all of its spawn, commonly called "tentacle beasts*, spread out and began infesting the upper layers, before the first ape uttered a word to another, before the first carbon atoms began arranging themselves into complex self-replicating machines that could one day be called cells, there was The Elder.

It's faster than you, smarter than you, and unfathomably large on a similar scale to the Abyss itself. If it so desired, it could unfurl one of its many vast tentacles, reach it up all the way through the Abyss, and crush a Fell Dragon, a Dune Devouring Borer, or a Drifting Swallower with little or no effort. It already knows you're here; it sensed you the moment your body brushed the surface of the water. The only reason it hasn't attacked yet is because travelers this far down are rare enough to pique its interest. It watches you from deep within the stygian gloom, so distant that it's impossible to tell whether the "main body" - if such a concept holds meaning for a creature of this scale - rests somewhere above you or below you. However, you can rest assured that one of its many tentacles is always squirming somewhere nearby in the dark.

After 25 days in this layer, it will begin to toy with you, likely starting with just ripping off a limb, maybe two. If it succeeds, you'll need an immediate medkit to avoid infection and bleeding to death. Even Khemia's master swordsmanship can only do so much against tentacles this fast, huge, strong, and numerous. Even with the Sunbeam Relic, he can only hold them off for so long. It'll barely notice just about any attack you can throw at it - it's simply too huge. An expert barrage of bullets, some explosions, even completely cutting through a massive tentacle - they all amount to no more than light scratches and paper cuts.

You'll need exceptionally creative use of powerful Relics just to stand a chance at enduring its attacks. The alien composition of its body flies in the face of the current understanding of biology, having no blood, brain, vital organs, or really any clear weak points or reliable way of killing it. Even finding the main body somewhere in this layer to begin with would be a challenge. Your best bet is to take all the Relics, supplies, and companions you've gained on your adventure and use them to escape The Elder and endure its attacks for as long as you can.

Be very careful about bringing out any Relics in this layer. It's smart enough to easily work out the function of most of them at a glance, and then can quickly plan circles around strategies involving them with its superior intellect. In fact, don't even think too hard about your Relics, or it might get a good idea of them from the cocktail of emotional response pheromones you leak into the water. If you're hoping for any chance of surprising it, remember that this entire layer is its eyes and ears (as well as various other appendages with no human equivalent.) It already knows all the Relics to be found in this layer, of course.

Even having it lightly play with you is fatal, but it decided when you entered this layer that it didn't want you swimming about for more than 50 days. If you're in this layer longer than that, it'll begin "fighting" in earnest, forcing you into this layer's Habitation option unless you have an incredibly smart plan to somehow defeat this unfathomable enemy or continue avoiding it when it decides to take you seriously. It might end up engaging you seriously earlier if you somehow prove to be a credible threat to it before then.
