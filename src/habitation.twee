:: Habitation L0 Description

So, you've decided you've had enough adventuring down in the Abyss, and you've returned a hero, with all your Relics as spoils of your quest. Congratulations! Feel free to sell off any Relics you no longer want at the shop and convert your remaining dubloons into whatever currency you like. The rest of your Relics are yours to keep!

This is probably the most open-ended Habitation option, as the entire surface world is your oyster after you return. Will you live a quiet, blessed life with your new Relics? Team up with Cloud and use your Relics to bring the world revolution? Bring humanity into a new technological age? We've got plenty of cheap, nice houses available in Outset Town too, and our economy is only going to get better as the Relic industry expands. Currently, many estimates tentatively pin us as having the best quality of life in the whole world, set to only go up as the years go on. Maybe you'd like to settle down and live here, serving as a voice of wisdom for future divers? Though, as I mentioned before, it may be a bit difficult up here if you have very disruptive or strange Curses - the people of Outset Town are a bit more accustomed to seeing the corrupting effects the Abyss has on divers than the rest of the world but are only slightly more tolerant of them. You'll still probably catch plenty of people gawking at your unusual ears or tail, and you'll definitely get in trouble if you picked up any sexual habits down there. Whether you settle down here or elsewhere, you'll have a difficult time fitting in with the rest of society if you have too many Curses. but I'm sure you'll figure something out eventually.

Ultimately, after you surface and leave the Abyss behind, your life and future belong to you.

:: Habitation L1 Description

Hidden in a remote corner of the first layer, the (admittedly slightly clever) name "Outcast Village" was derisively given to it by residents of Outset Town, though the residents of this village decided to embrace it and use it as the official name of their village. It's not nearly as bad as the name might imply; considering the relatively low corruption cost to return to the surface, most of the residents chose to live here of their own accord. Some worried that the Curses they amassed would make a return to normal society difficult, others found that they had grown weary of their old lives and found the Abyss more comfortable. 

People sporting tails, unusual eyes, and other Curse-induced changes are a common sight here. The village is much more close-knit and friendly than almost any you could find on the surface, and everyone tends to be united and very supportive of each other. Keeping in line with the results of mental Curses and the general theme of the Abyss, sexual attitudes are very lax, and the lack of public decency laws (and most other laws, as they tend to be superfluous down here) is very evident. Socially, you could liken it to an idealized bonobo-esque society. It has a current population of about 300

They've successfully mastered agriculture in the unique environment of the Abyss, and have plenty of fresh, safe drinking water. Technologically, they're pre-industrial revolution, though there have been talks among some residents in hopes of getting either geothermal generators or water turbines set up to provide electricity to the village. If you like, you could be part of those efforts, or you could try to shut those talks down and keep the village's current rustic charm.

:: Habitation L2 Description

The constant rain in this layer and resulting muddy, unstable ground has made building lasting structures on the ground difficult, especially with the limited resources provided by the Abyss. Instead, this village is built high up in the trees, shielded from view on the ground by dense brambles and leaves.

It's exactly as bad as the name would imply, and life is much harder down here than in the first layer. The constant, ceaseless downpour may sound fun to some, but it makes agriculture almost entirely unfeasible, and the village is forced to rely on hunting and foraging for its entire food supply. As it has roughly the same population as Outcast Village, much of the village often goes hungry. Crime runs rampant, and the latent sexual energy tends to amplify the stress the townsfolk feel every day and frequently leads to rape, molestation, and an all-around atmosphere of distrust and hateful sexual tension. They're very suspicious of outsiders, including you. Expect to be the bottom of the barrel nutritionally, socially, and sexually for quite some time after you settle in.

Limited available space for building up in the trees means housing is a problem, too, and uncomfortably large households of people stuffed together are a common sight. When diseases start, they can spread very quickly through the entire community.

All that being said, the village isn't a lost cause. It's definitely a much rougher start than Outcast Village, but if you put in time and effort, and revolutionize their food supply and housing situation, you could turn it into a rather pleasant rainy wonderland.

:: Habitation L3 Description

Just as you were resigning yourself to the fact that you were out of options and you would have to spend the rest of your days living off the rock candy in these caves and getting assaulted by tentacle beasts, a boulder right next to you is pushed aside, revealing a small spring of water, and a hand reaches out to pull you in. After being briefly tugged along through some underwater tunnels, you arrive here, to the secret home of the nymphs - humanoid nature spirits with various elemental qualities, some with flowing water or wind for hair, some with vines and flowers growing across their skin, some with small bits of earth or gems embedded in their skin like ornate piercings. You're to be their new pet.

They're rather kind masters, and they'll dote on you and treat you well. Unlike the previous two layers, the residents here are almost exclusively made up of Abyss natives. Nymphs and various non-humanoid nature spirits are a common sight. Others from the surface will only very rarely show up as other pets - so your owners are very interested in hearing your tales of what the surface is like. You'll be something of a status symbol to whoever you're accompanying on a given day, and you'll get to eat great food and experience some of the most breathtaking sights this layer has to offer. As you might expect, you'll be required to give many of the nymphs sexual relief as well, though they're very gentle so long as you don't resist.

The catch is that you have very little to no freedom about how you live your life. They own you now, and while you can voice your input and they might take it into consideration if you've been a good pet, they'll be deciding what you wear, what you eat, and how you spend most of your time. Everything they choose for you will be very nice, but ultimately out of your control. You're not the first pet they've taken in, and they know how to deal with misbehaving naughty pets who get silly ideas about using Relics for liberation. That's not to say it's impossible, but they're well prepared for the possibility of you trying.

There are actually a couple male nymphs too, but the female ones are definitely much more common.

:: Habitation L4 Description

There are no permanent settlements in this layer. Instead, there are various scattered tribes wandering the layer, following prey as it migrates with the changing seasons (all of them are different flavors of winter, but you'll learn to tell the difference eventually) and spending every night in tents huddled around campfires. The tribe that finds you - and takes you in as a slave - when you decide to settle down in this layer is primarily made up of people who were once divers from the surface like you, but various other tribes made up of goblins, orcs, trolls, and similar humanoids native to the Abyss wander the layer as well. All of the tribes have a pretty even mix of men and women.

As you should probably expect by now, they'll be using you for sexual relief, as well as various menial tasks around camp. Even if they were so inclined as to be kind or gentle with you, this layer just won't allow it - the weather is harsh, the resources are scarce, and you're the tribe's weakest link, so you should expect to be treated as an actual slave. They don't trust you, and they'll confiscate your Relics when they take you in. Spend a long time with them and you might be able to earn their trust and the right to carry Relics again, though I doubt they’ll give you any Relics that would allow you to retaliate against them. Work very hard and you might even earn enough trust to be allowed to participate in hunts or battles!

Right, battles. Often the different nomadic tribes will clash and end up fighting each other over territorial disputes and the like, or sometimes just because of the inherent pent-up stress of living in this layer. It might even be a sexual thing? Your tribe winning means that even you get to eat well for a while after looting your enemies' camp, and you might not be alone as a slave anymore, but losing means you'll be captured and enslaved by a new tribe, starting all over again. You might end up as the slave of a goblin, oni, or elf tribe or something. In the end they're pretty much all the same though; none of them will really treat you noticeably better than the others, and you are, in the end, a sex slave - no matter which species is your master.

You might have ambitions of becoming tribe chieftain or something, but I don't think that sex slaves tend to have that kind of upward mobility in real life. I mean, it's probably not impossible, but your odds just don't seem great no matter how you look at them.

:: Habitation L5 Description

Constructed near the border of the fifth and sixth layers, in a remote and barren location where they wouldn't be bothered by divers passing through, the researchers of this facility long ago broke off all communications with the surface and started operating as rogue agents. They'll use any means available to understand the secrets of the Abyss and attempt to conquer it, including, as is particularly relevant to you, human experimentation.

Life as a lab rat isn't so great. Much of their research is related to the Miasma, so you'll end up being purposefully lowered and raised through the layers, gaining several new exotic Curses - only some of which have been listed in the Curse sections - and some similar artificial mutations. Other tests may include injections of various materials unique to the Abyss to see how your body adapts to them, and the researchers* attempts to reverse the effects of Curses - they might succeed at a few, but most of them they'll just make worse. (Your life will never be in danger, though - the medical facilities here are crazy good, and you'll probably be much healthier here than you've ever been in your life.) The sexual energies throughout the Abyss are also an important topic of research, and something to overcome to one day conquer the Abyss, so your body will be subjected to sexual stress tests with a variety of machines, too. For science, of course.

You'll be living off various different kinds of nutrient sludge. This isn't a status thing; the researchers eat it too - they see normal food as a waste of time and resources, and prefer the efficiency. It doesn't taste bad, but it also doesn't really taste like food. It'll keep you almost unnervingly healthy, though.

They have a variety of Relics at their disposal to keep you restrained and keep you in line, and of course they'll be taking all your Relics, too. Most of the researchers have a rather flat affect, so forming strong bonds with them isn't likely. If you want to socialize with them, speak their language instead - science, data, and Abyssal discoveries.  Leaving your role as a lab rat would be near-impossible, but you might be able to assist with research in addition to it if you prove yourself capable. You might be surprised to discover that several of the most prominent researchers here are in the very same situation as you - trapped as involuntary lab rats, but still driven to understand the Abyss nonetheless, even as their bodies and perhaps minds slowly become less recognizable. Becoming your own test subject is the mark of a truly great mad scientist!

:: Habitation L6 Description

After passing out from starvation, dehydration, sexual exhaustion, simple despair, or some combination of the above, you woke up chained in a cell. Your captors - a group of succubi and incubi - eventually pay you a visit, and explain to you that you're currently imprisoned in a short series of underground magma caverns beneath part of layer 6. It's almost unbearably hot down here, but at least there's no tentacles?

For the demons, sex is nutrition, a pleasurable pastime, and a sort of sacred right for them, all in one. Not quite as pleasurable for you, though - when they take you in as a subject, they'll immediately use some special Relics to completely remove your ability to orgasm permanently, so as to transfer the pleasure to their king as a tribute. What you'll experience instead is constant, never-ending edging, forever building high but never reaching your peak.

Activities will include being the fucktoy for huge groups of succubi and incubi, being drugged with a cocktail of aphrodisiacs to turn you into a mewling begging mess, and giving you to the biggest tentacle beasts they can find as a toy, among others. They want to harvest as much sexual energy for their master as possible, and of course they like to have a bit of sadistic fun themselves, too.

Your diet will be nutritious demonic sexual fluids. Really, what else did you expect? After spending a long time in their care, consuming their fluids, sleeping on beds of naughty tentacles, and experiencing the very best in sexual torture this hell has to offer, your mind will become twisted, dark, and remarkably sexual inside. You'll start to take on some demonic traits, becoming something of a cambion, and your lifespan will be significantly extended. Your sexual torture will pretty much continue as usual, though. The demons are deep inside you at this point (always figuratively, often literally) and pulling yourself free or getting retribution is probably off the menu. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

:: Habitation L7 Description

After submitting to your robotic overlords, willingly or otherwise, they'll go about removing your pesky organic parts so you can start being a more productive part of society. After slicing off all the extra bits (don't worry, they'll remember the anesthesia), they ll take the pink lump in your head and transfer everything in it to a much more spacious hard drive, before discarding the lump along with all the other waste matter.
Your new android body will be designed to mirror the form granted to you by any Curses you've taken, as otherwise you'd likely experience a slow, painful Miasma rejection that would eventually destroy you. If that means that most of your body will be robotic nano-slime or covered in tiny metallic hairs to simulate fur, then so be it.

After that, you'll be trained to serve, submit to, and please the organics, being treated as no more than an object. To ensure that you can settle into your new role properly, you'll have some chips inserted into your new brain to ensure absolute obedience and absolute subservience, prevent you from thinking of yourself as anything more than an object to serve others, and prevent any kind of silly ideas like self-termination as a means of escape. These chips will eventually degrade after a few centuries, but it would be truly surprising if your thoughts remained recognizable after centuries of deep, constant mental conditioning.

By the way, it turns out this city actually does have humans, after all. They're asleep in some deep underground stasis pods, some of them with dreams of virtual reality, some without. "It's too bad you couldn't meet them while you were one of them," you don't think, because objects don't need to think about things like that. They've been asleep for quite some time, and will remain asleep for some time longer. But the robots prophesize that one day, when a distant, unknowing heir unites the surface in peace under a single banner, the Agarthans will awaken, and as storm clouds gather on the horizon, they will begin a great war to reclaim what was once theirs. You'll be there to serve them when that happens, sexually and perhaps militarily. For the time being you'll get plenty of practice servicing the other robots, so you can be perfectly built for their pleasure and convenience by the time they wake up. By the time the ability to question your situation returns to you, what will you have left? The world and self you knew will both be long gone, and it will be much easier to simply accept your new life and role.

Every day has been so exciting since you decided to start living in this big twisty maze-house. You get to spend every day having fun with all your twin brothers and sisters, without a care or responsibility in the world. Your days are filled with laughter, smiles, and exploration, always finding new hidden paths, secret rooms, and sometimes even discovering new treasure, no matter how many times you look! You don't ever have to worry about getting killed, and you can just keep working together and having fun! You can get into all kinds of naughty trouble together and there's never anyone to get angry at you about it! You get to eat all the food you want for free, and it's all delicious! Sometimes a new brother or sister comes down to join your family, and another one of you leaves to go on a big adventure outside, which is kind of sad…..but it's hard to stay lonely for long in a family this big! How many brothers and sisters do you even have? Is it thousands? Millions? It's hard to count.

You need only rely on the new eye in your head. Don t open the old ones; you will find only pain there.

Who are you, again? And where did your bones go? Your skin? All that's left is broken porcelain. What remains of your mind wanders about in a clouded haze as the world around you pulses with the red, throbbing dulled pain of attempted thought, You feel as though you need to suppress the urge to vomit, but remember you have no stomach, nothing left to vomit, just the facsimile of a mouth left on your face, unable speak, unable to unable to scream. Your body and mind alike are pulled roughly along by experimentation? punishment? If the strings of an invisible puppeteer,

Did you know that in some species of anglerfish, the tiny males fuse with the magnitudes-larger females during the mating process, becoming nothing more than a small fleshy bump on the female to supply her with sperm, entirely reliant on the female's circulatory system for nutrition and living the rest of his life attached to her?

The Elder precedes concepts like sex, and your sex is irrelevant in this equation, but you'll find yourself in a similar situation should you submit to the whims of The Elder. Its "mating process", if you'd call it that, is quite arduous and painful, as it restrains you with enormous tentacles, abuses your body's holes with no concern for your survival, and, if possible, removing whatever method you were using to breathe underwater, restraining you and drowning you repeatedly, only allowing you air when you're steps away from death's door. The Elder does not know gentleness or kindness; they are entirely foreign concepts that developed on the surface long after it first called these depths its home.

Eventually, your body will simply give up: you'll stop trying to breathe, your organs will fail, and you'll go completely limp. At this point the tentacles will carry your dying body over the main body of the Elder, and affix you to it. The Elder's body will take over your own, bits and pieces of it flooding into you, replacing your old cells, tissues, organs, blood, neurons...integrating you into The Elder in body and mind. The scale of its body and mind both transcend yours by several orders of magnitude, so it's hardly an equal fusion, and your sense of self, your entire identity, will be completely overwhelmed by The Elder's. From then on, it will use its new flesh-growth (you) to create experimental and exciting new species of tentacle beasts that it can spread to the upper layers. Whatever bits of "you" are still left will experience being a seedbed for tentacles, being relentlessly milked for sexual fluids, or both, continuing until the stars burn out. and then some.
