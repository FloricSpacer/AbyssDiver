!Layer 8 - Labyrinthine Bedlam
@@After pushing through the gate, you fall. No matter any power of flight, a mysterious force pulls you down. You keep falling for several minutes, through a white, featureless void. You slowly realize that your surroundings aren't as empty as they first appear; the monochrome features merely blend into their surroundings. An Escheresque tangle of impossible and entirely impractical architecture flits past you, filled to the brom with upside-down staircases, recursive loops, and non-euclidean shapes that are difficult to wrap your head around - all of these float in a lonely void, painted in a violent, stark white.

Slowly, you feel the directionality of your fall begin to shift, rotate, and before you realize it you're not falling, but running. You slow yourself and take a look at your new surroundings, a maze of disarmingly welcoming hallways loopng back into themselves, doors that lead to nowhere, and rooms too large for the space they occupy. Gravity asserts no dominance this deep in the Abyss, and after just a few minutes of walking, you find yourself back on the ceiling above the floor where you started. Space itself bends to the power of the Abyss, as four left turns around corners don't bring you back to where you started, and walking down the same hallway three times may bring you to three different places. You can feel your sense of time being distorted as well, and as you'll soon discover, it too is twisted and warped here, many different facets of possibility all converging into one point.

Space itself becomes your enemy in this layer, and navigation is incredibly difficult. If you're carrying the Star Compass Relic, you may subtract 5 days from all travel costs on this layer, as having a consistent indicator of which way is downward, which way you need to go to reach your destination, is invaluable here. A compass from Outset Town's shop, allowing you to better keep your directional bearings, is also helpful, subtracting 3 days from all travel costs on this layer.

Getting back up out of this terrible prison and back to layer 7 will take a staggering 40 days, and cost 100 corruption.

You stand in the middle of a twisting hallway, with forking hallway in literally all directions, including up and down. You already feel lost just looking at this disorienting scene. Suddenly the image shifts and you see the splendor of the Relics that are available on this layer.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 9-relics.png']]

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 9-wonders.png']]

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and Curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 9-curses.png']]

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threaths that await you on the layer

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 9-threats.png']]

Finally, the vision fades, leaving you standing once again where you were before, with only a brief sense of motion sickness as you orient yourself back to your physical body. As you look at the Gleam Dazer once again, you notice the Relic is cracked and broken.

You enter a large room entirely devoid of color, with every object in the room apparently made of a stone resembling marble. In the center, there is a large fountain with the semblance of of a roaring lion atop it, with water spouting from the open mouth of the marble beast. 

When you dip your hand into the water and take a sip, the water seems completely normal, though pleasantly pure. And you don't feel anything at first, but then after a moment, you feel as if a switch has flipped within you and your biological clock has stopped ticking forever. You will now forever appear to be <<print Math.round($app.appAge)>> years old, no matter how many years pass and how old you truly are.

You enter an enormous room with a single magical circle covering the entire floor. Strange magic rooms seem to fade in and out of existance as you stare at the mesmerizing patterns on the floor.

You can place any Relic in the circle and <i>if it has a specific range listed in meters (including with SI prefixes attached)</i> then you can break its spatial limits. At any point after this, you can freely alter the range of that Relic to any value between 1x and 100x of its original range. For Relics with multiple ranges listed, you can alter each of them individually. This boost is permanent and cannot be undone.

After using it, the runes will fade, leaving you unable to ever use Boundless Space again.

:: Layer8 Time [layer8]

<<if $timeUsed == 0>>
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Wonders/endlesstime.png']]

You enter a large, circular room with a number of glowing, magical spheres and strangely placed concentric rings hovering in the center. None of the sphere ever seem to move, but every time you shift you vision and look back at them the configuration of the room has changed. Each time you blink the positions seem to be a little different.

You can place any Relic in the center of the rings and <i>if it has a specific time listed in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months</i> then you can break its temporal limits. From this point on you can freely lower the times listed in the description to any value between the default value and 1% of the default. For example, a Relic that could be used "for 15 minutes every day" could be used "for 15 minutes every 15 minutes."

After using it, the orbs and circles will fade, leaving you unable to ever use Endless Time again.

In an incredible collaboration with colleagues on the surface, Saeko managed to develop some incredibly innovative water filtration techniques. The water purified from Lethe Taps using this technique is much safer to drink, though still hazardous. It's probably only 1/10th as dangerous as it would normally be, though you'll still be on a quick path to <<if $app.sex == "male">>himbo<<else>>bimbo<</if>>fication if you drink too much.
<<else>>
There is a very easily accessible source of water on this layer, the Lethe Taps, that are freely available everywhere and taste surprisingly like the tap water from the surface. Unfortunately, it also leaves you feeling a little hazy after a drink, and that is not simply a temporary effect. Each day of water you drink from these taps decreases you IQ by about half a point, leaving your mind in a subtly creeping fog that will leave you a <<if $app.sex == "male">>himbo<<else>>bimbo<</if>> in no time at all.

		You spot a distant figure slowly limping in your direction.<br><br>

		As it comes closer to you, you realize it resembles some sort of moving doll that's the same size as you.
		It has clumsy, stiff movements, but it clearly looks hostile and is approaching as a threat. <br><br>

		You feel almost mesmerized and simply stand where you are and observe it as the doll creeps ever closer to you. But just before it reaches you you pick up a loose, white stone from the floor and throw it at the shambling doll. <br><br>
		
		The doll's face collapses and it's body crumples into a useless heap before you. It wasn't much of threat, but it certainly was off-putting. It may be a dangerous sign of things to come.<br>

		Walking around the neverending halls of the eighth layer, you spot a porcelain figure standing at the end of the hallway. It is waving to you, apparently friendly.<br><br>
		
		Curiosity gets the better of you and you approach the figure. But soon it comes into focus and you are shocked by what you see. <br><br>
		
		It's a nearly exact replica of who you were before all this started! <br><br>
		
		<<say $mc>>Who are you? And why do you look like me?<</say>><br>
		Instead of responding your doll-like twin just keeps waving to you. Then, when you are within a few paces of the figure, you suddenly hear the ticking of clockwork and clanging of ceramic on stone.<br><br>
		
		One of the crossings you passed by earlier is swarming with the life-like puppets you encountered earlier. The dolls have changed their tactics, apparently they can try to ambush you now.<br><br>

		You fight your way out of the situation, but you realize something else. Something that sends chills down your spine. The waving figure is not the only one that looks like you.<br><br>

		They all look like you in some way. Maybe the don't quite resemble you as much as the waving figure, but they all seem like different, distorted versions of yourself, with different genders, extra limbs, different sizes, or some completely inhuman charateristics. Why are they here? What are these things?<br>

There is neither day nor night on this layer of the Abyss, you're not even certain that time is actually passing based on how much physics is breaking down here. But you certainly still experience time subjectively, and everyone needs to rest sometimes.

Today, as you are dozing, darkness creeps in around you. Stillness, silence, darkness. A chill runs along your skin, and you wake with a start. Darkness. Your lights do nothing to penetrate it. You think you hear a faint scraping of something out there, in the dark.

Your pulse skyrockets and your skin is covered in goosebumps. 

You can't see, and there's something out there.

Something absolutely terrifying.

You can't help but hold your breath, until you need to breathe again. The atmosphere is normal, yet suffocating.

Finally, after what feels like an eternity in the darkness, the shadow passes and the strange sourceless light of this layer returns to light up the disconcerting surroundings. You shake yourself, and find you were already standing up, were you dreaming and sleep walking? Were you hallucinating?

You're not sure. Still, that sound in the dark... some part of you can't completely calm down. You've got a feeling deep in your gut that there truly is something out there, something very bad, something that was looking right at you.
<<elseif $temp == "spiders">>\
You see motion in the corner of your eye, and turn to spot a large, chitinous arachnid, slowly spinning a web in your path. It must be as big as your hand and its legs are longer than your fingers as they wriggle along the web it's spinning.

Then, more motion. More spiders. 

Some are small and spindly, some enormous with prominent fangs. Some sleek and alien with jerky motions, some hairy and agile. 

They are everywhere. 

To the left, to the right, in front of you, and behind you. You look up, and see spiders webbing the ceiling. You look at the floor, and look on in horror as they scuttle around, closing in on you from every direction.

You start to panic. What is this? You glance back in front of you, and see spiders descending on lines of silk. Then you feel something touch your arm, another something touch your back, another something land on your head.

You run, screaming, flailing about, trying to get away from them.

You crash through webs, getting yet more spiders on you.

You look up, and see one large hairy leg descending down your forehead. Then, they're gone.

They're gone. You're fine, except you're not fine. You're shaking from head to toe, and your heart is hammering out a drumroll in your chest. You run your fingers over your hair, over your limbs, over everything.

They're gone, they were never real, but they felt real. You try to calm down, asserting your rational mind, but it doesn't work very well. Eventually, you just huddle up into a ball for a while, shuddering, and letting tears flow from your eyes.
<<elseif $temp == "wolves">>\
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/wolfhallucination.png']]

You were walking through a hallway just a moment ago, but you must have zoned out. Now you're in a large space. 

One of the rooms of this layer? It's quite empty, or you think it is until you notice the large wolf staring at you from about 30 feet away, it's teeth barred. Your breath hitches, and you consider doing a number of things, but they're blotted out of your mind as it lowers its shoulders and slowly starts to stalk towards you, circling just a bit.

You slowly start to back away from it, searching yourself for something to defend yourself with. You're coming up empty. Did you drop your gear while you zoned out? Your eyes whirl around, trying to keep track of the large predator stalking around you, and then you see a second wolf, a third, half a dozen wolves are approaching you, circling you from every direction. Even armed, what can one person do against six wolves? Their feet make soft padding sounds on the floor, but they are each over a meter tall.

Their jaws are open as they slowly tighten the circle around you. You can faintly hear their panting. From somewhere slightly further away you can hear howls, but the six wolves circling you are not so vocal. One darts in closer to you, and you jump back while trying to punch it, but you miss.

It rejoins the ever tightening circle of beasts unscathed. Another makes a pass at you, and you dodge, but as you do, you feel sharp fangs gripping your leg from behind you. 

You flail, and stumble, and they are upon you. 

You desperately try to fend them off, but they're biting at your arms and legs, and you're on the ground. Then one goes for your throat, and you know death is coming.

You see into its feral eyes, and feel its teeth start to come down on your throat, and then they're gone. 

You're lying on the floor of the hallway. Eyes wide, mouth dry. You swear you can still feel their teeth ripping into you, but... what was that? How are you still alive?

Your eyes dart around you, and despite your efforts, you cannot entirely calm down. What is even real? Down here, you're not sure.
<<elseif $temp == "snakes">>\
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/snakehallucination.png']]

<i>Hisssssss</i>

A sound suddenly comes from behind you, but when you turn around there isn't anything there, so you continue your journey through the winding hallways of the layer. 

<i>Hisssssssssss</i>

Again, the sound repeats. But this time it sounds much closer than before. You shiver at the thought of the creature that must have made it, but you can't do much besides moving on for now.

<i>Hisssssssssssssssss</i>

This time the sound is right behind you, and you spot the source: a small black viper with it's mouth open, exposing the slick fangs within.

It slithers towards you, taking a slow, winding path as you back away. But then you hear another sound from the opposite side of the serpent.

<i>Hisssssssssss</i>

Another, brown snake is approaching you from behind. And when you turn back to the black one, you spot 3 more approaching from behind it. 

Before you realize what's going on, you the snakes have surrounded you, but more of them keep coming. They're slithering out of cracks in the walls and dropping from holes in the ceiling. And they're angry. 

Every moment, the circle tightens around you. What was a 3 meter radius becomes 2, then 1. They're constricting your movement, but there's nowhere to run besides into the venomous swarm. The hallway is small and tight and filling with more snakes every moment. 

And before you decide on a course of action, one of them leaps at you. A sharp pain emanates from where it bit your leg. And you decide to run, but realize you can no longer move. Your muscles scream in agony, but don't respond to your commands, and so you fall.

And the snakes cover you and bite again. The agony intensifies. 

The snakes cover your vision and the world goes dark, besides the pain of your body being broken down and devoured by the serpents, of course.

But then, you open your eyes and look around to see that you're in a perfectly "normal" area of the eigth layer, not a snake in sight and not a single bite mark on your body.

You try to shake the memory of the experience from your mind to get moving again, but it's hard to forget something like that. Even if it wasn't real, this layer must be getting to you.
<<elseif $temp == "insects">>\
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/insecthallucination.png']]

You hear a clicking, chittering sound coming from one of the walls of the twsting hallway you're walking down. But when you look at the walls, you only see the same luminescent white stone that you always do on this layer, nothing seems any different.

But the sound grows louder, and it sounds like it's coming from all around you, like there's a storm of something hidden just behind the stone, chittering beyond your view.

Then a crack appears. A piece of the wall crumbles and a small insect that looks like a warped locust pushes its way through the gap and begins to fly around. Then it's followed by another. And another.

A second crack appears, unleashing another string of insects into the air around you, so you pick up your pace to get away from them. But they keep coming, and new cracks are opening along the entire hallway.

Soon, you can't avoid the bugs, and you're constantly swatting them away from you to keep them from landing on your body. But they aren't deterred, and keep coming to try to cover you. 

Eventually, one bites you on the back of your neck, drawing a small amount of blood and that seems to drive the swarm into a frenzy. They bite and scrape your skin and no matter how much you push them away, more come to fill in their place.

They're eating you alive! You can't help but scream and fall to the ground to try and protect yourself and prolong your life as long as you can.

But suddenly, they're all gone? You suppose it wasn't real, but an experience like that isn't easy to shake off.
<<elseif $temp == "slime">>\
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/slimehallucination.png']]

A wet, gurgling sound grabs you attention from beyond the next turn in your path. Khemia has spotted it too and he's gripping the handle of his sword tightly. 

After a moment of anticipation, a pair of creatures that vaguely resemble grotesque women made of green slime turn the corner and head towards you and Khemia.

Khemia draws his weapon and attempts to fight the creatures, but each of his strikes passes through, harmlessly. And with each strike, his weapon becomes more degraded, as the acidic slime eats away at the materials and the face of the creature becomes a twisted grin. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>No! It won't end like this!<</say>>
Khemia sounds panicked, but manages to keep fighting, no matter how futile it seems. 

Meanwhile, the second creature grips your arm, and as you pull away, you find that despite the appearance of a soft slime, you're held tightly in place. The creature gurgles once again and you feel her touch you. The clothes on your arm are burned away and you scream when you feel her do the same to your skin.

<<say $companionKhemia>>No! I can beat you!<</say>>
You hear Khemia fighting, but when you turns towards you after your scream, the creature fighting him grabs him too.

<<say $companionKhemia>>AAAAAHHHHHH!<</say>>
He's crying out in pain, an imitation of your own, as the slime creatures engulf more of each of you, burning all of the nerves in both of your bodies, you collapse from the pain, fading into certain death.


...Then you wake up, completely unharmed. Khemia is sitting down, a puddle of vomit in front of him and his fists balled tight. He breathes heavily, but tries to calm himself when he sees you're awake.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It wasn't real. I didn't expect something like that... It felt so real. But we're safe. We can keep going... even if it means facing that again.<</say>>
He's obviously shaken, but he seems willing to move forward. You should probably follow his lead and get back to traveling after losing so much time to that illusion.
<<elseif $temp == "desperation">>\
As you wander through the bright halls of the layer, you hear a surprised yell from your companion, Cloud.

<<say $companionCloud>>Are you ok? How did you get down here?<</say>>
He isn't talking to you, and when you turn to face him, you see him offering a hand to an emaciated woman who seems to be weeping. 

<<say $rndF>>Please, help me! I can't take it any more!<</say>>
She cries out and try to grip him more tightly, causing him to stumble, but he manages to keep his balance.

<<say $companionCloud>>Don't worry, we'll take care of you. Do you need help getting back to the surface? That would take quite a while, but I think we could try to take you with us on our journey.<</say>>

<<say $rndF>>No! Why can't you help me? I never did anything wrong...<</say>>
The woman grips her head and screams, causing Cloud to visibly flinch and recoil from her, even as he makes an effort to stay calm for her. Then another door opens in the hallway an elderly man with sunken eyes and a long beard staggers out. His clothes are ragged and it looks like he's on the verge of starvation.

<<say $rndM>>Food... I need something, please!<</say>>
The man seems to go into a frenzy at first, but his body barely responds and he limps towards you, intent on some sort of confrontation. The woman screeches again, one hand holding her head and the other hoding Cloud in place, but this time he pulls away from her.

<<say $companionCloud>>I don't... I don't think this is real. We can't help them.<</say>>
He seems like he's talking to himself more than you, as if convincing himself it's ok to leave these people here. But his thoughts are interrupted by more doors opening along the hallway and more people calling out. 

<<say $rndF>>Has anyone seen my daughter? She can't survive without me!<</say>>

<<say $rndM>>Please, I can't take it here any more, you need to take me with you. You can't just abandon me!<</say>>

<<say $rndF>>Water... I just need one sip of water. I can't even feel my lips any more... I'm so tired.<</say>>
The voices reach a discordant cacophy of desperation, with no relief in sight. But some of the people charge at your and your companions, forcing you to fight them off. They respond just like normal, weak, desperate humans. Each blow feels like you're hurting someone who just wanted help. 

But these can't be real people, there's no way they could have survived down here, right? And even if they were, it's self-defense...

Eventually, you're surrounded by people, many collapsed and moaning in pain on the ground, and others aren't moving at all, as if their body had given out in their final assault against you. You spot Cloud as he kneels down at the body of one apparently unmoving woman. He seems to whisper something to her, but you can't make out the words.

Then suddenly, everything is gone, you're once again in an empty, white hallway, on pace to continue your journey. When Cloud looks back at you, tears are running down his face.

<<say $companionCloud>>I guess it wasn't real after all. We should probably get moving then.<</say>>
But this event isn't easy to forget. And based on the look on Cloud's face, it's made a deep impression on him as well.
<<elseif $temp == "rot">>\
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/rothallucination.png']]

As you walk through the hallways of the layer, a stain appears in the unnaturally pristine walls that surround you. A black spot that seems like a bit of mold growing on bread, except it's on the solid stone.

On second glance, it seems to be growing, expanding outward at an alarming pace, threatening to cover the shining walls and coat them in a tainted residue. But as it grows, it also sprouts small structures, like mushrooms, and they seem to be releasing a foul-smelling powder of some sort.

Then you hear a scream.

<<say $companionCherry>>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!<</say>>
Cherry's voice is louder than you've heard before, a shocking contrast to her typical silence. But you immediately spot the cause of her panic, she's holding up her arm and a similar black spot has appeared on it, just like the one on the wall. 

<<say $companionCherry>>Get it off me!<</say>>
She's frantically scraping the skin on her arm, to no avail, as the spot ignores her violent protests and starts to spread across her skin.

<<say $companionCherry>>Help me, $app.name! Help me!<</say>>
She's calling out to you, and you see her arm has nearly entirely blackened. She's struggling to hold it up now, as if it were a dead weight attached to her torso.

But then you also spot a prickling sensation on your own arm, and spot a black spot on you too. The prickling becomes ore intense, and you can feel the dark spot growing on you and into you, as if it's consuming your arm from the inside. It seems impossible you can dig it out at this point. 

Instinctively, you try to dig at it and tear it off, but it's more than skin deep now, its tendrils are growing into you and the soon your arm feels nothing at all, as if it were a foreign growth attached to your body. 

And it keeps spreading, never stopping or slowing, as you slowly lose control of your limbs and collapse onto the ground. You manage to spot Cherry weeping, the black rot finally creeping towards her head, her tears are becoming tinged with black dust. 

It consumes you, leaving nothing of you left but a corpse to fester and provide a source of food for further growth. 

Not a person. 

Not even a body. 

Just a thing.

You close your eyes for the last time.


...Then you open them again. And everything is back to normal, or as normal as things can get this deep in the Abyss. You look down at yourself and see no hints of the horror you just experienced, meaning it must have been an illusion, right?

Cherry is curled in a ball, taking shallow gasps and staring at her shaking hands. It takes her a few minutes to even respond to you as you try to calm her down.

<<say $companionCherry>>Why? Why did this happen to me?<</say>>
Her voice is quiet, but she manages to get back to her typically somber self eventually. Unfortunately, this isn't something that you can forget easily, but you'll have to try to so you can complete the expedition.
<<else>>
There is neither day nor night on this layer of the Abyss, you're not even certain that time is actually passing based on how much physics is breaking down here. But you certainly still experience time subjectively, and everyone needs to rest sometimes.

Today, as you are dozing, darkness creeps in around you. Stillness, silence, darkness. A chill runs along your skin, and you wake with a start. Darkness. Your lights do nothing to penetrate it. You think you hear a faint scraping of something out there, in the dark.

Your pulse skyrockets and your skin is covered in goosebumps. 

You can't see, and there's something out there.

Something absolutely terrifying.

You can't help but hold your breath, until you need to breathe again. The atmosphere is normal, yet suffocating.

Finally, after what feels like an eternity in the darkness, the shadow passes and the strange sourceless light of this layer returns to light up the disconcerting surroundings. You shake yourself, and find you were already standing up, were you dreaming and sleep walking? Were you hallucinating?

You're not sure. Still, that sound in the dark... some part of you can't completely calm down. You've got a feeling deep in your gut that there truly is something out there, something very bad, something that was looking right at you.

Shadows seem to flow from invisible cracks in the perfect white walls and creep around you. Then a deep, unnatural chill settles into your bones.

There is undoubtedly something out there, in this thick darkness. The air feels heavy with the weight of the shadows.

The atmosphere is oppressive, as if it is squeezing you tightly around your whole body. But this isn't an illusion, you feel real pressure as the darkness squeezes you, gripping your flesh and attempting you rend you.

This time, you need to fight back, or you risk being torn apart by the shadows.

Silently, small arachnid shapes emerge from the walls, leaving trails of sticky silk in their wake. Their webs block out your escape, they advance on you. 

They jump, and skitter. They drop and swing on strands of webbing, legs flailing to try to find purchase on you.

Through the swarm, eight shiny eyes of enormous proportion emerge. A spider that shouldn't exist, one that didn't evvolve for hunting flies, but perhaps deer, or bears... or humans.

Behind the tightening veil of the brood it lurks, fangs twitching, legs tensing as it moves adeptly through the webs that surround you.

A group of shadowy, canine forms approach you, and the walls seem to recede to give them room to circle you ominously. Their fur is dark and eyes are bright yellow, and each of them is the size of a small lion.

The pack of wolves stalk you, barring their gleaming teeth in preparation for the attack.

A familiar serpentine hissing seems to appear from all around you, a chorus of slithering threats.

Then you spot them emerging, crawling out of invisible holes in the walls. The slide and slither over each other as the swarm surrounds you. Some lay low, but others bar their fangs and hiss, a clear poison dripping copiously from the vicious instruments.

The circle tightens, you only have a few moments to think before they are upon you. 

How will you overcome these serpents?

You hear a clicking, chittering sound coming from one of the walls of the twsting hallway you're walking down, but when you look, nothing seems amiss.

But it doesn't take long for the Abyss to correct that misconception, as bugs begin to emerge from hidden crevices in the walls and from around corners in the hallway.

They swarm densely, as if consciously building their strength before they attack you. They only leave you a few moment to plan your defenses.

How will you defeat these insects?

A wet sloshing sound approaches rapidly from down a staircase in front of you, filling the hallway with a viscous slime. 

You manage to jump quickly to some higher ground, but the level of the slime keeps rising. Khemia yelps when a bit of the slime splashes against some of his exposed skin and leaves a distinct burn mark.

The slime keeps rising, and you have nowhere to go. 

But suddenly, you spot it, a door that leads to another staircase going up, about 30 meters away. If you can make it there, then you should be able to escape they slime and survive.

With the caustic threat approaching, how do you plan to survive?

A person seems to yelp from around a corner and both you and Cloud turn to hear their voice.

<<say $rndF>>How did I get here? Where did my kitchen go?<</say>>
It's an emaciated woman, she seems to panicking. She looks over at you and begins to shake uncontrollably and scream.

<<say $rndF>>Monsters! Stay away! I won't let you take me! I WON'T!<</say>>
She looks around frantically, then seems to pull out a large kitchen knife. 

From around a corner a strange man seems to look at the woman, but then he spots you and his eyes go wide. He shakes fearfully as he holds a carpenters sledgehammer and begins to approach you. 

New people are coming from every direction, there doesn't seem to be any way to run unless you fight your way through a mob. Cloud looks to you with clear concern in his eyes. This is one of the only times you've seen him so uncertain and so... afraid.

How will you deal with these people?

You spot a black mushroom extending its mycelium onto the ground and into the wall. You turn around to avoid it, but when you turn, you find yourself facing a new hallway filled with the vile-looking fungi. 

The mushroom appears to cough and begins to spew a fine black dust into the air, but instinctively you know that it wouldn't be a good idea to breathe that in. 

Cherry blinks rapidly at the sight of the fungus and holds a shaking hand up to her face, as if expecting herself to disappear, but she's still there for now.

How will you get past this toxic rot without breathing it in?

You can't outrun it, you can't defend against it. There's nowhere to hide. Whatever is out there in the darkness, this time it comes for you.

You don't know what it is that slashes and tears through the flesh on your side. You don't have time to respond though. Your nerves go haywire as something grips the back of your head and slams you face first into the ground, with a shocking brutality.

If it wasn't already completely dark, everything would have gone black. Through the pain and the fear, you can feel your consciousness fading.

.......

You wake up, but you're not in good shape.

You're bleeding, pretty badly.

You think you can survive this, but you really need some medical attention. Your next 5 travel times are increased by 4 days each and you are now threatened by death if another threat were to defeat you.
<<elseif $temp == "spiders">>
You have fought long and hard to get here, but nothing you've done, nothing you know, nothing you possess, can stop this thing.

The venom of the smaller spiders is getting to you, but you try to run anyway, in spite of the burning.

You are too slow, far too slow. The towering spider is on you in a flash, striking fangs deep into your shoulder, then withdrawing.

You feebly try to strike at it, but it's out of range far before you can manage it. You stumble forward, and it stalks you, staying out of range, waiting for the venom to take greater effect as it dissolves your flesh inside the wound.

Then you must have given it an opening, because it's on you again, sinking its fangs into your leg.

Your vision blurs, and you collapse, but you're filled with absolute terror as you realize you can no longer move your muscles.

The hulking spider begins draping webbing over you. Its 8 jagged legs scrape against you, but you can do nothing.

It bundles you up, and then you feel its fangs in your neck.

Through the pain and the fear, you feel yourself fading.

You pass out.


........

You awaken. You don't know what happened, but the webbing is gone, you're free.

You're in terrible shape though. Blood still oozes from some of the many punctures over your body and you have a hard time moving any of your muscles.

Your head swims with what feels like some vile poison.

You vommit, and as you get up, you're unsteady on your feet.

You think you can probably survive this, but you seriously need some medical attention. All future travel times are increased by 7 days unless you get medical treatment and you are now threatened by death if another threat were to defeat you.
<<elseif $temp == "wolves">>
Try though you might, you don't have what it takes to overcome this pack of Abyssal wolves.

You're hyperventilating, sweating, screaming in futility as they wear you down and start taking landing bites.

Their jaws rip at your legs and drag you down. Your arms are ravaged by fangs, and any defenses you have are knocked away.

Your air is cut off, and blood starts running down your neck from powerful jaws. You can feel them start to rip, and you pass out.


........

Somehow, you wake up. You're covered in your own blood. Isn't that supposed to be inside you instead of outside of you?

Fang punctures and tears are all over you. It's some kind of miracle that you haven't died.

Where did the wolves go? They had you. You don't understand.

You're grievously wounded though. You're going to need medical attention. All future travel times are increased by 7 days unless you get medical treatment and you are now threatened by death if another threat were to defeat you.
<<elseif $temp == "snakes">>
One of the snakes bites your ankles and you instinctively yelp in pain as you pull away. 

But the toxin acts quickly and you are barely able to move. Another snake slithers over around you paralyzed limb, squeezing you gently as it slides up your body.

You almost hyperventilate as the creatures follow suit and swarm over you. And you feel a few more pricks across your body, leaving you entirely unable to move as the snakes cover your vision and swarm across you for untold hours.

But eventually, the swarm leaves, and you find yourself still alive. You're barely able to move, the venom had lingering paralytic effects. All future travel times are increased by 7 days unless you get medical treatment and you are now threatened by death if another threat were to defeat you.
<<elseif $temp == "insects">>
You try to swat the swarm away from you, but they just keep coming.

You crush one in your hands and another replaces it in an instant. 

None of your attacks make any impact, they only delay the inevitable.

When you can't keep them off you any more they start biting and scratching, leaving you bloody. You can only hope they aren't leaving their eggs and maggots to grow inside of you. You really don't want to think of that. 

But fortunately, before you feel they can devour all of your flesh, they leave you.

You cough, and a small locust emerges from your throat, prompting you to vomit. But you're safe, for now.

The swarm's attack has left you seriously injured. Your next 5 travel times are increased by 4 days each and you are now threatened by death if another threat were to defeat you.
<<elseif $temp == "slime">>
You simply dive into the slime and make a break for the escape staircase. Khemia yells something after you angrily, but you can't make out his words.

The moment you touch the slime, you scream as it burns you and eats away at your flesh. 

It almost feels alive. Like the slime is trying to worm its way into your body and consume you from the inside.

You can't do anything but keep pushing forward. 

And finally, you push through the pain and manage to reach the safety of the stairs. You can hear yourself screaming as you make your way up towards safety.

Fortunately, you haven't suffered any fatal injuries, but you do have chemical burns all over your body. Your next 5 travel times are increased by 4 days each and you are now threatened by death if another threat were to defeat you.
<<elseif $temp == "desperation">>
You try to fight off the people without injuring them, but they prove to be too much for you. 

Despite each one being weak, the crowd just keeps coming relentlessly, overcoming their obvious fear to come together and attack your party. 

Eventually, you end up with many cuts and some broken bones before the crowd decides that you've been defeated. 

They head off into one of the side passages, but you can still hear whispered worries and confusion. They speak about returning home and escaping. They wonder where they are.

But you can't answer their questions.

Fortunately, you're able to mostly recover when they're gone. You are injured though, so your next 4 travel times are increased by 3 days each and you are now threatened by death if another threat were to defeat you.
<<elseif $temp == "rot">>
You don't have any adequate countermeasures, so you simply decide to walk through the ominous hallway filled with fungus and rot. You can filter your breath through a cloth and try to move quickly, but those measures are clearly inadequate.

Despite your best efforts, you can't help but breathe in some of the spores.

You cough involuntarily, and you can't stop coughing. Cherry tries to comfort you, but she's coughing too.

The coughs become more violent, until eventually you make it through the passageway and safely away from the fungus. But at this point your coughs are tinted red.

You feel weaker, like something is eating away at you from the inside. All future travel times are increased by 7 days unless you get medical treatment and you are now threatened by death if another threat were to defeat you.

After using your weapon on your umbral foe, a shriek emerges from the inky blackness, and light returns to the room you were in. A frail shadow crumples to the ground, then folds in on itself, bending in unnatural ways and screeching.

Eventually it shrinks beyond your view, apparently faded away into nothing.

Whatever it was, you're sure you've defeated it, but it was merely a single threat this layer. You are certain that there are more things like that lurking here, just out of sight.
<<elseif $temp == "spiders">>
Harnessing the power of your weapons, you turn their combined might on the fell spider and fight for your life.

Eventually, a quiet hissing squealing sound comes from the direction of your foe, along with frantic clicking.

The webbing around you disappears, the smaller spiders quiver in place and vanish.

The clicking grows slower and softer. The enormous spider seems to dwindle in size. It has rolled over on its back, its legs twitching.

It seems to shrink further, and you approach in horrified curiosity. It... isn't really a spider. Whatever it is though, it's clearly dying.

With a few final twitches, its diminishing legs seem to just dissolve, along with the carapace and its innards.

You are victorious, but you feel a bit unsettled by the whole experience. What was that thing?

What other strange creatures lurk down here?
<<elseif $temp == "wolves">>
Harnessing the power of your weapons, you lash out at the wolfpack, grievously wounding the largest among them.

Under the ferocity of your attack, the other wolves let out yipping whines as they retreat, and then fade out of existence.

The wolf you wounded though, its blood runs red in the snow, but then starts fading. The snow fades away, the blood turns clear.

You look on quizically at the... thing. It has taken on the shape of a wolf, but... it's not truly a wolf.

You suspect you've dealt it a mortal wound though.

You lash out once again, and all movement stops. The corpse that had the shape of a wolf just evaporates.

What a strange place this is. What strange things inhabit it?
<<elseif $temp == "snakes">>
You manage to keep the snakes back and the swarm begins to thin out. 

Minute by minute, less and less of the snakes remain. Until finally, the last one is defeated.

Suddenly, their corpses seem to melt and give way to some dark viscous substance, which itself seems to meld with the surrounding architecture, leaving no remnants of the enemy you faced here.

What was that, truly? Was it real or only another dream. Fortunately you defeated it this time, so you do not have to find out.
<<elseif $temp == "insects">>
You use your weapons to push back the swarm, keeping them away from you as you think their numbers. 

It takes quite a while, but you manage to ward them off long enough for the swarm to disperse, it seems the threat is finally fading. 

There are surprisingly few insect corpses for how much fighting you've done, but it doesn't matter now. You just want to move on and to rest.
<<elseif $temp == "slime">>
You use your tools deftly to escape the oncoming caustic tide, ensuring you can safety reach your destination without any harm.

The slime keeps rising, but you can follow the staircase upwards. Further and further until the slime is far above your head, apparently stuck to the ceiling? Regardless, you're safe now and can continue your journey.
<<elseif $temp == "desperation">>
You manage to defeat or escape from the the crowd, then you run until they are far behind you and their voices fade from your ears.

<<say $companionCloud>>I hurt one of them... I hurt them and they bled and they called out for help. But no one came to save them. I thought it was an illusion, but that was real flesh, real blood that I spilled... I think they were innocent.<</say>>
Cloud has his fists balled tightly to his side as he mutters to himself. But he tries to calm down and places his hands over his eyes for a few moments. 

When he removes them, he's smiling again. It's his usual charming smile, but it seems more sad now, somehow. And you spot the wet trails running down from his eyes despite the appearance of a confident smile.

<<say $companionCloud>>Sorry about that. There's no way that could be real. There's no need to worry yourself about it. We shouldn't let that stop us from continuing our journey.<</say>>
His smile falters, but holds as he insists that everything is fine. Eventually you move on, but a part of you still wonders about the people you saw earlier...
<<elseif $temp == "rot">>
You manage to make your way through the perilous rotten hallway, and once you're a safe distance away from it, you take a breath of clean, fresh air. Or at least as fresh as it can get down in this dimensional hell.

Cherry's hands are shaking, but she's quiet. She doesn't say anything when you try to speak to her at first, but after a few tries she gives you a small smile and speaks.

<<say $companionCherry>>It's ok, $app.name. We beat it... So maybe I can beat it too...<</say>>
Her voice is quiet, but it seems like she's come out better for having faced her fear and made it through safely. Perhaps not everything you experience down here is horrible.

You wait as your balloon rapidly ascends and you can watch the metallic buildings shrink beneath you. Swarms of robots seems to pursue their mysterious duties as if they were ants scurrying about an anthill. Luckily they don't seem to pay much attention to the air, and even the occasional flying robot pays you no notice as you ascend towards the gate to the sixth layer.
