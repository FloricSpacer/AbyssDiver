!Layer 8 - Labyrinthine Bedlam
@@After pushing through the gate, you fall. No matter any power of flight, a mysterious force pulls you down. You keep falling for several minutes, through a white, featureless void. You slowly realize that your surroundings aren't as empty as they first appear; the monochrome features merely blend into their surroundings. An Escheresque tangle of impossible and entirely impractical architecture flits past you, filled to the brim with upside-down staircases, recursive loops, and non-euclidean shapes that are difficult to wrap your head around - all of these float in a lonely void, painted in a violent, stark white.

Slowly, you feel the directionality of your fall begin to shift, rotate, and before you realize it you're not falling, but running. You slow yourself and take a look at your new surroundings, a maze of disarmingly welcoming hallways looping back into themselves, doors that lead to nowhere, and rooms too large for the space they occupy. Gravity asserts no dominance this deep in the Abyss, and after just a few minutes of walking, you find yourself back on the ceiling above the floor where you started. Space itself bends to the power of the Abyss, as four left turns around corners don't bring you back to where you started, and walking down the same hallway three times may bring you to three different places. You can feel your sense of time being distorted as well, and as you'll soon discover, it too is twisted and warped here, many different facets of possibility all converging into one point.

Space itself becomes your enemy in this layer, and navigation is incredibly difficult. If you're carrying the Star Compass Relic, you may subtract 5 days from all travel costs on this layer, as having a consistent indicator of which way is downward, which way you need to go to reach your destination, is invaluable here. A compass from Outset Town's shop, allowing you to better keep your directional bearings, is also helpful, subtracting 3 days from all travel costs on this layer.

Getting back up out of this terrible prison and back to layer 7 will take a staggering 40 days, and cost 100 corruption.

Getting back up out of this terrible prison and back to layer 7 will take a staggering 40 days and cost 100 corruption. Hopefully you're prepared to make the journey.

You stand in the middle of a twisting hallway, with forking hallway in literally all directions, including up and down. You already feel lost just looking at this disorienting scene. Suddenly the image shifts and you see the splendor of the Relics that are available on this layer.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 9-relics.png']]

As an image of the wonders you might find on this layer starts to come into focus, an intense feeling of humility washes through you.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 9-wonders.png']]

The mystical possibilities of the wonders fade from your view and you suddenly feel nauseous, as if a huge amount of miasma was suddenly sucked into your chest. You visualize the corruptions and Curses that may afflict you in the layer below.

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 9-curses.png']]

Finally the nauseous feeling passes but is replaced by a brief sense of terror as you get a glimpse of the threats that await you on the layer

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Clipped-Fin/Abyss Diver Page 9-threats.png']]

Finally, the vision fades, leaving you standing once again where you were before, with only a brief sense of motion sickness as you orient yourself back to your physical body. As you look at the Gleam Dazer once again, you notice the Relic is cracked and broken.

	After walking down a hallway that seems to twist and turn in impossible ways, you find yourself in a large chamber filled with floating, white orbs of various sizes. The orbs emit a gentle humming sound that is both soothing and eerie. As you reach out to touch one of the orbs, it changes shape, taking on the form of a familiar face from your past. It speaks words of comfort, but the voice is distorted and unnatural. You quickly withdraw your hand, and the face dissipates back into an orb. You can't shake the feeling that this place is trying to manipulate your emotions, making it harder to distinguish between reality and illusion.<br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 2>>
	You find yourself in a room where the walls, floor, and ceiling are covered with intricate, interlocking patterns that shift and change before your eyes. The longer you stare, the more mesmerized you become by the hypnotic movements. Just as you feel yourself becoming lost in the patterns, a sudden jolt brings you back to your senses. You realize that the room itself is rotating, and that you must focus on maintaining your balance to avoid being thrown off your feet. You quickly exit the room and continue your journey through the labyrinthine halls of the layer. <br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 3>>
	You enter a hallway that seems to stretch on forever in both directions. The walls are lined with countless doors, each one identical to the next. As you walk, you notice that the doors seem to be whispering in a multitude of voices, each one offering advice, secrets, or warnings. Curiosity gets the better of you, and you open one of the doors, only to find that it leads to another identical hallway, with the whispers becoming louder and more urgent. Realizing the danger of becoming trapped in this maze of voices, you quickly retrace your steps and manage to find your way back to the original hallway, vowing to ignore the whispers for the rest of your journey. <br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 4>>
	You turn a corner and find yourself confronted by a large, shimmering mirror. The surface of the mirror is ever-changing, and you see distorted reflections of yourself and your companions, as well as glimpses of past and future events. Some of the reflections are unsettling, showing versions of yourself twisted by darkness or despair. The mirror seems to be a nexus of possibilities, and you feel an unnerving pull to touch its surface. With great effort, you resist the temptation and move on, haunted by the images you've seen. <br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 5>>
	The hallway you enter is shrouded in a thick, unnatural fog that seems to cling to your skin and makes it difficult to breathe. You hear footsteps behind you and catch glimpses of shadowy figures in the mist, but when you turn to face them, they vanish as if they were never there. Your sense of unease grows with each step, as you feel unseen eyes watching your every move. You press on, eager to leave this suffocating atmosphere behind and praying that the figures lurking in the mist are only figments of your imagination. <br><br>
<<elseif $layerTemp == 7>>
	You find yourself in a long hallway that appears to be filled with a dense fog. As you move through the fog, you begin to see faint outlines of figures on either side of the hallway, reaching out to you with desperate, grasping hands. You can hear their whispers, pleading for help and salvation, but you can't determine whether they're real or just a cruel illusion. Despite your compassion, you know that stopping to help could mean your own doom, so you press on, the haunting whispers and outstretched hands fading into the fog behind you. <br><br>

	You walk through an unending maze of halls and rooms. Every step you take seems to be a guess, as it can be hard to tell up from down and north from south, even assuming things stay in the same place when you look away. Normal laws of navigation mean little here, but somehow you're still able to make some semblance of progress at the cost of a lot of time.<br><br>

:: Fountain of Youth Site [layer8]

[img[setup.ImagePath+'Wonders/fountainofyouth.png']]
<<set $eternalYouth = $time>>\
The dizzying path through the abstract architectural maze of the eighth layer has led you to an unusually serene pocket. Entering the colorless expanse, you're immediately drawn towards the marble construct at its heart. As you approach, the Fountain of Youth looms larger, the regal marble lion atop it frozen in a moment of silent fury, spewing forth a stream of water that twinkles with an otherworldly glow.

As you approach the fountain, the air seems to grow cooler, and a faintly sweet aroma teases your senses—an inexplicable scent that evokes memories of the first dew-kissed morning of spring, the intoxicating freshness of a rain-washed world. A tingling curiosity spurs you to reach out, to dip your fingers into the ever-flowing water. The sensation is like immersing your hand into liquid silk—cool, smooth, and inviting.

Bringing your wet hand to your lips, you cautiously sip the water. It tastes of purity itself, a sweetness that is not sugary but profound, like the first breath of air after a long dive. As the water trickles down your throat, you feel a moment of stillness, as though your heart has skipped a beat.

Then, the sensation emerges, subtle and powerful. A warmth blooms from your core, radiating outwards through your veins, filling you with a deep and resounding vitality. You feel lighter, stronger, as if a weight you've been carrying unknowingly has been lifted off. You touch your face, half expecting a transformation, but your features are unchanged. Yet, something within you has certainly shifted — something unseeable, untouchable, but inescapably present.

You drank from the Fountain of Youth. You will now remain as you are, a youthful embodiment of yourself, aged <<print Math.round($mc.appAge)>> years. As time moves and the world shifts, you remain unchanging, a fixed point in the universe's ever-flowing river of time.

:: Boundless Space Site [layer8]

<<if $spaceUsed == 0>>
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Wonders/boundlessspace.png']]

A disconcerting sensation washes over you as you cross the threshold into Boundless Space. A pulsing glow bathes your form, igniting the particles in the air with subtle aurora-like displays. The spectral quality of this illusory light lends the area a surrealistic touch, painting stark shadows that seem to dance and undulate in the corners of your eyes. The air here feels dense, saturated with an ancient power that prickles against your skin like static electricity, causing your hairs to stand on end. The taste of ozone hangs heavy on your tongue, a sharp tang reminding you of the impending storm that this room represents.

Your steps echo ominously across the sprawling room, the sound warping and distorting as if swallowed by the twisting contours of reality itself. As your eyes trace the spiraling designs of the magic circle, a vertigo sensation creeps up on you, the room seeming to breathe and shift, the floor undulating beneath your feet like a living entity.

The immense, chaotic mosaic of the magic circle appears almost three-dimensional, its runic symbols ebbing and flowing as if alive. Each character seems to vibrate with an otherworldly force, sending out harmonics that whisper to your very soul - a song of ancient power and infinite potential. An alluring urge pulls you towards the epicenter of the circle, the promise of what could be achieved by harnessing this space teases at the edges of your consciousness.

You can place any Relic in the circle and <i>if it has a specific range listed in meters (including with SI prefixes attached)</i> then you can break its spatial limits. At any point after this, you can freely alter the range of that Relic to any value between 1x and 100x of its original range. For Relics with multiple ranges listed, you can alter each of them individually. This boost is permanent and cannot be undone.

After using it, the runes will fade, leaving you unable to ever use Boundless Space again.

Choose a Relic to spatially limit-break.

:: Endless Time Site [layer8]

<<if $timeUsed == 0>>
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Wonders/endlesstime.png']]

Stepping into the large, circular room, you immediately feel a shift, a sense of detachment from the chaotic reality of the Abyss. The air itself hums with an alien energy, tugging at the edges of your perception and creating a tangible ripple against your skin.

Bathed in the soft, resplendent glow of the spheres, your eyes drink in the sight of these delicate, hovering celestial bodies. They pulsate rhythmically, their shades of azure and jade splintering into kaleidoscopic shards that refract against the stark white walls. Their silhouettes paint nebulous shadows, the lines blurring, overlapping, merging into a mesmeric dance of light and darkness.

The floating rings, intricately entwined amongst the spheres, are an uncanny spectacle. At times, they appear solid, forged of a silver that gleams with an otherworldly sheen; in the next moment, they flicker and fade into translucent whispers of their former selves. As you watch, the entire tableau shifts and morphs. The configuration of the spheres and rings, frozen in time just a heartbeat ago, twists subtly, bending to the whim of unseen forces. 

None of the sphere ever seem to move, but every time you shift you vision and look back at them, the configuration of the room has changed. Each time you blink the positions seem to be a little different.

You can place any Relic in the center of the rings and <i>if it has a specific time listed in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months</i> then you can break its temporal limits. From this point on you can freely lower the times listed in the description to any value between the default value and 1% of the default. For example, a Relic that could be used "for 15 minutes every day" could be used "for 15 minutes every 15 minutes."

After using it, the orbs and circles will fade, leaving you unable to ever use Endless Time again.

Choose a Relic to temporally limit-break:

In an incredible collaboration with colleagues on the surface, Saeko managed to develop some incredibly innovative water filtration techniques. The water purified from Lethe Taps using this technique is much safer to drink, though still hazardous. It's probably only 1/10th as dangerous as it would normally be, though you'll still be on a quick path to <<if $mc.sex == "male">>himbo<<else>>bimbo<</if>>ification if you drink too much.

There is a very easily accessible source of water on this layer, the Lethe Taps, that are freely available everywhere and taste surprisingly like the tap water from the surface. Unfortunately, it also leaves you feeling a little hazy after a drink, and that is not simply a temporary effect. Each day of water you drink from these taps decreases you IQ by about half a point, leaving your mind in a subtly creeping fog that will leave you a <<if $mc.sex == "male">>himbo<<else>>bimbo<</if>> in no time at all.

	The strength of this Curse takes you by surprise. our penis surges to full erection and continues to grow in size. The base, shaft, and tip swell at a disconcerting rate. Drops of precum ooze from the tip like thick honey, yet the growth doesn't cease. 

	Finally, the curse releases its grip, but your jaw drops in disbelief as you realize you now possess a $mc.penisCor inch long member. The erection lingers for a while longer, and adapting to such a massive endowment without it hindering your movement will surely demand practice. You wince from a pinching sensation as you awkwardly hobble forward.

<<elseif $mc.penisCor<1 && $mc.breastsCor > 0>>
	The strength of this Curse takes you by surprise. Your nipples protrude like taut pencil erasers, and tiny streams of milk seep out as an intense pressure and stretching sensation engulfs your breasts. Your swelling bosom strains against your skin, momentarily as taut as overinflated balloons. The skin stretches to accommodate the expanding mass, and the dribbles of milk evolve into three powerful squirts before the ordeal ends.

	You gawk at your new $mc.breastsLabel cup breasts, and even your heavy breathing sends tremors through them. You wonder if bras exist that can support such a voluptuous transformation. Surely they must, but you feel off-balance as you teeter forward.

<<else>>
	You are overwhelmed by sensation as the Curse grips you, and you fall to the ground. Your back arches as your penis springs to full erection, and bulges ever larger. Your nipples jut out like pencil erasers and small dribbles of milk start to come out of them as an intense pressure and a stretching sensation fills your breasts. The base, the shaft, the tip of your penis are swelling to an alarming degree and drops of precum start oozing out of the tip. As your breasts swell to gargantuan proportions, the dribbles of milk turn into periodic gushes. Then, finally, the curse releases its grip. 
	
	You stare slack-jawed down at yourself as you realize you're now sporting a $mc.penisCor inch long dong, which is throbbing in sync with your pulse, between your two heaving $mc.breastsLabel cup breasts. This is a pretty dramatic change to your body. You just lie there on the ground for a minute coming to grips with what has just happened to you.

[img[setup.ImagePath + $curse100.pic]]

As you tread through the impossible corridors of the eighth layer, something deep within you shifts. A foreign feeling takes root in the heart of your being, a feeling as confounding as the disordered architecture surrounding you.

Suddenly, the familiar sensation of a filling bladder disappears, erased from your conscious awareness as if it had never been. Confusion washes over you. You know the feeling should be there, but it’s gone. There's an unsettling emptiness, a void in your perception of your own body. Your internal body map, once a reliable guide to your physical needs, has been rewritten. The feeling is more than just alien - it's uncanny, unnerving.

You stand frozen, a disoriented figure in the paradoxical eighth layer, wondering how you'll manage this newfound Curse. You need to urinate but can't. The pressure builds until it's unbearable, and then, without warning, you lose control. Warmth spreads down your legs, a stark contrast to the cold tendrils that had previously engulfed your body.

The sharp smell of ammonia fills your nostrils, a pungent reminder of your own mortality in this unfathomable place. It's humiliating, but also unsettling in a deeper sense - a reminder of how fundamentally this Curse has disconnected you from the rhythms of your own body.

In this moment, you look forward, your mind already wrestling with the implications of this Curse. Simple things, once taken for granted, are now significant challenges. The prospect of ever feeling 'normal' again seems like a distant dream.

As you navigate the dizzying spectacle of the eighth layer, a sudden chill races down your spine. You pause, an instinctive reaction, and try to assess your surroundings. The incoherent whispers of the labyrinth fade, slowly replaced by a vacuum-like silence. It starts subtly, the distant echoes growing quieter, until all you can hear is the rhythmic pounding of your own heartbeat.

Your breath catches in your throat as panic sets in. You tap your fingers on the surreal surface of a nearby wall, testing, yet no sound echoes back. All is still. All is silent. You scream into the void, but the void holds no echo of your voice. A void, not of space, but of sound, engulfs you.

Your body remains untouched, but the silence — oh, the Deafening Silence — feels like a physical weight pressing on your chest. The sharp rustling of your clothes, the light patter of your footsteps against the strange surfaces, the comforting hum of your own breath — all gone. You realize the bitter irony; in a place where reality seems so warped and twisted, this sensation is all too real.

You're deaf. A cold sensation creeps up your spine as you come to terms with this new reality. Stripped of your ability to hear, you feel the abyssal void pulling you in deeper. You touch your ears, as though trying to ascertain the physical reality of this Curse. They're still there, physically unchanged, yet functionally redundant.

Your mind spins as you consider the implications of this change. How will you navigate this labyrinthine nightmare without the sense of hearing? You think of companions lost in the eeriness, unable to hear their calls. Will this silence be a constant companion? The scenarios that play in your mind are unsettling, bordering on terrifying.

Yet, as the fear slowly subsides, it makes way for an unfamiliar sense of excitement. The Abyss has always been a place of trials, of overcoming the insurmountable. And while this newfound silence is disconcerting, it also provides a strange, eerie solitude, as if you were the only being in this sprawling chaos of inverted physics.
<<else>>\
The air around you hums with an unsettling vibration, a sensation that seems to ripple out from an unseen center. You've felt this before - the inevitable ripple of the Abyss reaching out to touch you. You're far enough into this unknowable place that you know not to resist it.

Suddenly, there's a sharp, unimaginable pain that rips through the side of your head, a sensation as if your ears are being violently torn from the side of your skull, the skin being ripped by the sudden pull. You scream, but the echo that should reverberate through the chaotic halls is swallowed by an oppressive silence. You reach up instinctively, only to touch the smooth, unblemished skin where your ears once were. There is no blood, no sign of injury – just the shocking absence of your ears.

The pain continues to throb, relentless and merciless. It feels like being immersed in a relentless sea, waves of pain washing over you, one after another. It's as if a great force has reached inside you, wrapped its insistent fingers around your very core and squeezed mercilessly.

You crumple to your knees, clutching at the sides of your head as you gasp for breath. The pulsating agony blots out everything else, reducing your world to the stark white environment and the silent echo of pain.

Slowly, you become aware of something else – a profound silence. The usual distant hum of the Abyss, the small sounds of your own movements, the rhythm of your heartbeat – all are gone, swallowed by the unending quiet. Even your own gasping breaths are eerily silent to your own ears.

You're deaf.

The realization crashes into you like a wave, the full impact of the Curse taking root in your understanding. The Abyss has taken another piece of you, its inscrutable will manifesting in this cruel way. You're deaf in a place where every sense is crucial for survival.

In the disorienting silence, you try to stand again. You're faced with the staggering reality of this new existence, deafened in a world already intent on warping your senses. It feels like a daunting challenge, a mountain of unimaginable scale placed before you.

Yet you're left to wonder - how will you survive in a place where your ears were one of your most vital tools? How will you hear the unseen threats slithering in the stark whiteness, or the whispered words of allies, or even your own voice in the emptiness of the Abyss?

Time loses meaning in the face of this newfound silence. You ponder how this will change your journey, your interactions, and most dauntingly, your very survival. As your fingers explore the smooth, pain-throbbing skin on the sides of your head, you are forced to accept your new reality.

A tangible tension hangs in the air as you journey further into the labyrinthine depths of the Abyss. The silence here is absolute - each footfall, each breath feels like an invasion of the Abyss's sacred, alien tranquility.

Then, in the stark stillness, a dread sensation pricks at the periphery of your consciousness. You pause mid-stride, caught in the sudden grip of foreboding. A split second of dread anticipation passes before the Curse hits. It's as sudden as a winter storm and as brutal as an executioner's axe.

A violent tremor seizes your body, rippling through your flesh and bone like a sound wave through water. It's an incredible pain, not of the body but of the soul. You can feel it seeping into your core, burrowing like a parasite into the very essence of your being.

You try to scream, but no sound emerges from your lips. It's as if the Abyss itself has reached into your mouth and ripped the voice from your throat. Silence fills the space where your cry of pain should have echoed, a harsh reminder of your new reality.

A wave of despair washes over you. This is not the adrenaline-fueled panic of a fleeting moment, but a bone-deep terror that threatens to consume your will. In the deafening silence of the Abyss, you feel completely alone. You reach out with trembling hands, grasping for any form of comfort, any vestige of the world you once knew.

You touch your throat, but it's as solid as ever. No wound mars your flesh, no injury hinders your voice physically. Yet the silence remains, more oppressive than any physical constraint. Your breath is as steady as ever, your heart beats with the rhythm of life. But your voice, your songs, your laughter, your screams... they have been extinguished, stolen away by the Abyss.

Your thoughts race, a whirlwind of fears and uncertainties. How will you communicate? How will you warn your companions of danger or comfort them in their times of need? Your existence has been reduced to silence, to absence of words, to the negative space where sound should be.

The gravity of your situation weighs heavily on your heart. The Curse has not just stolen your voice; it has stolen your means of connection, your ability to comfort, to express, to warn. It has reduced your world to an unsettling silence.

As you stumble forward in your newly-muted existence, the magnitude of your isolation becomes clear. The eighth layer of the Abyss is not only a paradox of non-euclidean design, but it is now a realm of silence, a place where even your thoughts seem to echo in the hollow void of your stolen voice. Your mind begins to fill in the silence, projecting a haunting symphony of ghostly whispers, remnants of your voice echoing within your thoughts.
<<else>>\
In this disorienting labyrinth of the eighth layer, you feel a twist in your gut. An icy tendril of fear creeps up your spine, leaving a sheen of perspiration in its wake. You draw in a sharp breath and swallow hard, and that's when you feel it: a sudden tension in your mouth. An inexplicable pressure building beneath your tongue, a mounting, primal terror. Before you can even react, your world is consumed by a burst of white-hot agony.

Pain swarms your senses, a raging maelstrom tearing your focus asunder. Your vision tunnels and your knees buckle. Your hand flies to your mouth, the skin of your fingers coated with a sudden warmth. A strangled gasp tears itself from your chest, a garbled, gurgling scream erupting from deep within. You can feel your tongue—your lifeline, your voice—wrenching away from your mouth. It feels like a piece of you, a part of your identity, is being savagely ripped away.

As suddenly as it began, the torment subsides. An eerie calm blankets over you, bringing a hollow, unsettling silence. Your hand falls away from your mouth, fingers trembling. Your breath hitches in your chest, a strangled whisper of a sound that is suddenly too loud in the terrifying quiet. You attempt to swallow, to speak, to scream, but nothing comes out. Just a muffled whine, a barest hint of a gasp that trails off into a chilling silence.

As you reel from the violation, your fingers tracing the smooth, numbed expanse where your tongue once resided, the magnitude of the Curse settles in. The rippling echoes of its violent manifestation are still fresh in your mind, yet the implications start to overwhelm the shock. A sudden dread weighs heavy in your chest. Your breath comes in short, rapid gasps, silence gripping you with a vice-like intensity.

The thought of navigating the Abyss without a voice is a prospect that freezes your blood. You'll be unable to call out to a companion, unable to issue warnings, unable to express pain or relief or joy. You're mute, a silent ghost in a land of shifting shadows and convoluted dimensions. How will you communicate, you wonder? How will you ward off danger, or signal for help? The lack of a voice doesn't just hinder your ability to talk — it's an impediment to survival itself.

Fear wells up within you. As your hand presses against the cold, distorted walls, you can't help but wonder what further changes are yet to come. What future awaits you in these depths? Will you survive the tumultuous journey or will you succumb to the darkness? Only the Abyss knows, and its lips are as sealed as your own.

As you navigate through the maddening maze, your attention is abruptly stolen by an invisible force that grapples your senses. It's as if the very ether of the Abyss has decided to engage you in a novel way. The stark white walls around you begin to blur, and you find yourself in an uncanny silence. The architectural anomalies around you fade into the background as your reality narrows to a singular point of focus.

Suddenly, an intense sensation sweeps over your nose. Scents once familiar, a kaleidoscope of past experiences and memories, become amplified in an overwhelming crescendo. The freshly baked bread from your favorite bakery, the intoxicating fragrance of a freshly brewed cup of coffee, the comforting aroma of old parchment in the library, even the heady scent of the sea, a memory from your childhood. They flash in your mind, reminding you of a world so distant from the Abyss.

And then, as abruptly as it had come, the sensory deluge fades. In its stead, a cold emptiness settles. It's not just the absence of smell, but the abrupt erasure of an entire sensory avenue. There's a peculiar sort of blindness, a void where a vibrant world of smells once existed.

Your nostrils flare, instinctively seeking to draw in the scent of the Abyss, the acidic tang of the strange fauna, the mildewed scent of the cryptic flora. But there's nothing. Only the cold sterility of nothingness. You find your tongue instinctively darting out to taste the air, your eyes scanning your surroundings, your fingers reaching out to touch the eerily flawless surface of the walls. Your remaining senses hyper-focus, compensating for the sudden loss.

You sit for a moment, attempting to come to terms with this inexplicable change. Thoughts of home, of the surface world and its cornucopia of sensory experiences, come crashing in. It's a terrifying thought that you may never again smell the rich scent of an ongoing barbecue or the soothing fragrance of an early morning rain.

You rise, your body feeling strangely lighter, perhaps a phantom sensation of your lost sense. You reach out, placing your hand against the stark white walls of the eighth layer, their cold smoothness a grounding reality. There's a silent vow etched in your resolve. The Abyss has claimed a piece of your humanity, yes, but you won't let it claim all of it.

As you wander through the endless corridors of the eighth layer, a gust of wind engulfs you, the energy of the Curse weaving its way into the fibers of your being.

At first, it's a tingling, a mild buzz resonating from your shoulders. But then it intensifies, as if molten iron courses through your veins, morphing into a symphony of pain and surprise. And then, just as abruptly as it began, it recedes. The quiet following the storm leaves you panting, your chest rising and falling rapidly.

Opening your eyes, you find that you're standing still amidst the endless pathways. Your gaze falls to your arms. But, there's something different, something that wasn't there before.

A gasp escapes your lips. Protruding from your shoulders, perfectly mirroring the ones you're accustomed to, are two additional arms. Flesh and blood, but alien to you. They are covered with your skin, carry your scent, but feel detached, their motions awkward and uncontrolled.

Experimentally, you flex the new appendages, feeling an unfamiliar sensation as muscles you've never used before respond clumsily to your commands. These strange new limbs, they flutter like the wings of a newly hatched bird, unaccustomed to the rhythm of flight. Every shift, every movement sends an odd, disjointed sensation up your spine.

As you grapple with your new reality, your mind is awash with thoughts of the future. What would this mean for your journey? Would these limbs become a hindrance or perhaps, with time and practice, a strange asset?

You wonder how you will eat, how you will drink, how you will fight. Your hands, your original ones, they've grown accustomed to the harsh reality of the Abyss, the brutal battles, the delicate handling of relics. But these, these newcomers, they seem to possess an unrefined clumsiness. You see years of relearning ahead of you, a daunting prospect.

As your mind whirls, you gaze down at your body, a peculiar sight in this white, stark maze. You trace your fingers along the new muscles, the strange articulation of these new joints. You ponder the weight of their existence, the undeniable shift in the dynamics of your own body. You feel heavier, more anchored, yet somehow more adaptable.

You give a wry smile, looking down at your new arms. There's a certain allure to them, a sensual novelty. Yes, they're strange, alien even, but they're a part of you now. And, as you've learned throughout your journey in the Abyss, adaptation is key to survival.

A soft hum resonates in your ear, growing louder and more persistent. You can't discern its source, but it wraps itself around your senses, penetrating deep within you, leaving you with an uneasy anticipation. Your heart pounds in sync with this uncanny rhythm, and you realize - it's the pulsating heartbeat of the Abyss.

The hum amplifies to an unbearable roar, culminating in a crescendo that sends a shock wave through your body. You gasp as an ice-cold sensation washes over you, emanating from your core and surging outwards. A sudden and complete nothingness swallows the regions of your body where your genitals and nipples once were.

You glance down at your chest. The familiar twin peaks are gone, leaving only smooth skin in their place, the same $mc.skinColor color and texture as the rest of your torso. A perplexing sight, for sure, yet the sensation is even more bizarre. You brush your fingers across your chest - it's unnerving, the skin untouched and unmarred where your nipples used to be.

Your heart thumps hard against your ribs as you look down at your groin. The smoothness is striking. Devoid of any defining characteristics, your lower torso mirrors the bare architecture of the Abyss, the ultimate symbol of your surrender to its mysteries.

The initial shock is soon replaced with a strange tranquility, as if you've been unshackled from your body's primal urges. You no longer feel the warmth, the throbbing, the vulnerability of those parts.

You're drawn out of your thoughts as a new sensation surges through you. A strange, alien sensation in your gut. It dawns on you: with no natural route for waste expulsion at the front, your body has adapted, redirecting everything 'round back. The realization brings with it a profound sense of unease.

The weight of these changes sits heavy on your shoulders. Not just the physical alterations, but the mental repercussions too. How do you come to terms with a body that's no longer the same as it once was, stripped of the parts that once defined your sex? How do you explain this to those waiting back home?

Yet, the Abyss calls to you, still, like an intoxicating siren song. Its beauty, however chilling, undeniably enchants you. You find yourself moving again, compelled to explore the erratic labyrinth, your bare form now a testament to its might.

Accepting this Curse triggers an abrupt transformation. Your lower body ripples as if invisible waves crash against it, and your legs snap together with an unsettling force. The pressure intensifies, mercilessly compressing everything between your legs as they continue to merge. Your anus and genitals shift, settling into a new position on the front of your body. Fish scales emerge from your fused legs, the bones within shifting and reshaping. 

As you look down, you witness two fins sprouting from the sides of your merged, pointed toes. The experience is a curious mix of discomfort and exhilaration.

Then, five rows of slits appear on either side of your neck. Instinctively, you snap them closed, realizing they are gills that you can control. 

The implications of this transformation weigh heavily upon you. If you plan to spend much time on land, you've just rendered yourself a helpless, floundering fish with arms. However, if your journey leads you to watery depths, this newfound form may prove to be a blessing in disguise.

Your heart races, and your breath quickens as you surrender your desires. You can feel the heat of the arousal suffusing your body, a spark of life amidst the cold white Abyss surrounding you. The pleasure builds, a growing crescendo that sweeps over you until it reaches its zenith.

But then, the unexpected happens.

Your body begins to stiffen, a cold, hard sensation starting at your fingertips, then creeping up your arms and down your legs. The icy sensation travels across your chest and down your spine, even as pleasure continues to ripple through you.

Your skin turns grey and hard, your muscles solidifying like stone. You watch in fascination as your body hardens, the fine details of your form accentuated, carved like a statue. Every curve, every indentation of your body turns rigid, frozen in the throes of ecstasy. The rush of pleasure begins to dim, the sensations muffled by the stone encasing your body.

Unable to move, you can only witness as your body becomes a monument to desire, solid and unmoving. Yet, you're still conscious, aware of your surroundings. You can still sense the eighth layer around you, its chilling indifference, its harsh, beautiful light. You're an observer now, a statue amidst the labyrinthine paths of this layer.

Your mind whirls, contemplating how this Curse will change your life. Your private moments of pleasure have become a dangerous gamble, a dance with the cold hardness of stone. How will you navigate this treacherous existence, always teetering on the edge of pleasure and petrification?

Minutes seem to stretch to infinity as you remain locked in stone, until slowly, warmth begins to return. The stone encasing your body crumbles, releasing you back into your flesh and blood form. You draw a shaky breath, tasting freedom again.

You look down at your body, flesh and blood once more, as you continue your journey.

		You spot a distant figure slowly limping in your direction.<br><br>

		As it comes closer to you, you realize it resembles some sort of moving doll that's the same size as you.
		It has clumsy, stiff movements, but it clearly looks hostile and is approaching as a threat. <br><br>

		You feel almost mesmerized and simply stand where you are and observe it as the doll creeps ever closer to you. But just before it reaches you you pick up a loose, white stone from the floor and throw it at the shambling doll. <br><br>
		
		The doll's face collapses and it's body crumples into a useless heap before you. It wasn't much of threat, but it certainly was off-putting. It may be a dangerous sign of things to come.<br>

		Walking around the never-ending halls of the eighth layer, you spot a porcelain figure standing at the end of the hallway. It is waving to you, apparently friendly.<br><br>
		
		Curiosity gets the better of you and you approach the figure. But soon it comes into focus and you are shocked by what you see. <br><br>
		
		It's a nearly exact replica of who you were before all this started! <br><br>
		
		<<say $mc>>Who are you? And why do you look like me?<</say>><br>
		Instead of responding your doll-like twin just keeps waving to you. Then, when you are within a few paces of the figure, you suddenly hear the ticking of clockwork and clanging of ceramic on stone.<br><br>
		
		One of the crossings you passed by earlier is swarming with the life-like puppets you encountered earlier. The dolls have changed their tactics, apparently they can try to ambush you now.<br><br>

		You fight your way out of the situation, but you realize something else. Something that sends chills down your spine. The waving figure is not the only one that looks like you.<br><br>

		They all look like you in some way. Maybe the don't quite resemble you as much as the waving figure, but they all seem like different, distorted versions of yourself, with different genders, extra limbs, different sizes, or some completely inhuman characteristics.

There is neither day nor night on this layer of the Abyss, you're not even certain that time is actually passing based on how much physics is breaking down here. But you certainly still experience time subjectively, and everyone needs to rest sometimes.

Today, as you are dozing, darkness creeps in around you. Stillness, silence, darkness. A chill runs along your skin, and you wake with a start. Darkness. Your lights do nothing to penetrate it. You think you hear a faint scraping of something out there, in the dark.

Your pulse skyrockets and your skin is covered in goosebumps. 

You can't see, and there's something out there.

Something absolutely terrifying.

You can't help but hold your breath, until you need to breathe again. The atmosphere is normal, yet suffocating.

Finally, after what feels like an eternity in the darkness, the shadow passes and the strange sourceless light of this layer returns to light up the disconcerting surroundings. You shake yourself, and find you were already standing up, were you dreaming and sleep walking? Were you hallucinating?

You're not sure. Still, that sound in the dark... some part of you can't completely calm down. You've got a feeling deep in your gut that there truly is something out there, something very bad, something that was looking right at you.
<<elseif $temp == "spiders">>\
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/spiderhallucination.png']]

You see motion in the corner of your eye, and turn to spot a large, chitinous arachnid, slowly spinning a web in your path. It must be as big as your hand and its legs are longer than your fingers as they wriggle along the web it's spinning.

Then, more motion. More spiders. 

Some are small and spindly, some enormous with prominent fangs. Some sleek and alien with jerky motions, some hairy and agile. 

They are everywhere. 

To the left, to the right, in front of you, and behind you. You look up, and see spiders webbing the ceiling. You look at the floor, and look on in horror as they scuttle around, closing in on you from every direction.

You start to panic. What is this? You glance back in front of you, and see spiders descending on lines of silk. Then you feel something touch your arm, another something touch your back, another something land on your head.

You run, screaming, flailing about, trying to get away from them.

You crash through webs, getting yet more spiders on you.

You look up, and see one large hairy leg descending down your forehead. Then, they're gone.

They're gone. You're fine, except you're not fine. You're shaking from head to toe, and your heart is hammering out a drumroll in your chest. You run your fingers over your hair, over your limbs, over everything.

They're gone, they were never real, but they felt real. You try to calm down, asserting your rational mind, but it doesn't work very well. Eventually, you just huddle up into a ball for a while, shuddering, and letting tears flow from your eyes.
<<elseif $temp == "wolves">>\
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/wolfhallucination.png']]

You were walking through a hallway just a moment ago, but you must have zoned out. Now you're in a large space. 

One of the rooms of this layer? It's quite empty, or you think it is until you notice the large wolf staring at you from about 30 feet away, it's teeth barred. Your breath hitches, and you consider doing a number of things, but they're blotted out of your mind as it lowers its shoulders and slowly starts to stalk towards you, circling just a bit.

You slowly start to back away from it, searching yourself for something to defend yourself with. You're coming up empty. Did you drop your gear while you zoned out? Your eyes whirl around, trying to keep track of the large predator stalking around you, and then you see a second wolf, a third, half a dozen wolves are approaching you, circling you from every direction. Even armed, what can one person do against six wolves? Their feet make soft padding sounds on the floor, but they are each over a meter tall.

Their jaws are open as they slowly tighten the circle around you. You can faintly hear their panting. From somewhere slightly further away you can hear howls, but the six wolves circling you are not so vocal. One darts in closer to you, and you jump back while trying to punch it, but you miss.

It rejoins the ever tightening circle of beasts unscathed. Another makes a pass at you, and you dodge, but as you do, you feel sharp fangs gripping your leg from behind you. 

You flail, and stumble, and they are upon you. 

You desperately try to fend them off, but they're biting at your arms and legs, and you're on the ground. Then one goes for your throat, and you know death is coming.

You see into its feral eyes, and feel its teeth start to come down on your throat, and then they're gone. 

You're lying on the floor of the hallway. Eyes wide, mouth dry. You swear you can still feel their teeth ripping into you, but... what was that? How are you still alive?

Your eyes dart around you, and despite your efforts, you cannot entirely calm down. What is even real? Down here, you're not sure.
<<elseif $temp == "snakes">>\
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/snakehallucination.png']]

<i>Hisssssss</i>

A sound suddenly comes from behind you, but when you turn around there isn't anything there, so you continue your journey through the winding hallways of the layer. 

<i>Hisssssssssss</i>

Again, the sound repeats. But this time it sounds much closer than before. You shiver at the thought of the creature that must have made it, but you can't do much besides moving on for now.

<i>Hisssssssssssssssss</i>

This time the sound is right behind you, and you spot the source: a small black viper with it's mouth open, exposing the slick fangs within.

It slithers towards you, taking a slow, winding path as you back away. But then you hear another sound from the opposite side of the serpent.

<i>Hisssssssssss</i>

Another, brown snake is approaching you from behind. And when you turn back to the black one, you spot 3 more approaching from behind it. 

Before you realize what's going on, you the snakes have surrounded you, but more of them keep coming. They're slithering out of cracks in the walls and dropping from holes in the ceiling. And they're angry. 

Every moment, the circle tightens around you. What was a 3 meter radius becomes 2, then 1. They're constricting your movement, but there's nowhere to run besides into the venomous swarm. The hallway is small and tight and filling with more snakes every moment. 

And before you decide on a course of action, one of them leaps at you. A sharp pain emanates from where it bit your leg. And you decide to run, but realize you can no longer move. Your muscles scream in agony, but don't respond to your commands, and so you fall.

And the snakes cover you and bite again. The agony intensifies. 

The snakes cover your vision and the world goes dark, besides the pain of your body being broken down and devoured by the serpents, of course.

But then, you open your eyes and look around to see that you're in a perfectly "normal" area of the eight layer, not a snake in sight and not a single bite mark on your body.

You try to shake the memory of the experience from your mind to get moving again, but it's hard to forget something like that. Even if it wasn't real, this layer must be getting to you.
<<elseif $temp == "insects">>\
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/insecthallucination.png']]

You hear a clicking, chittering sound coming from one of the walls of the twisting hallway you're walking down. But when you look at the walls, you only see the same luminescent white stone that you always do on this layer, nothing seems any different.

But the sound grows louder, and it sounds like it's coming from all around you, like there's a storm of something hidden just behind the stone, chittering beyond your view.

Then a crack appears. A piece of the wall crumbles and a small insect that looks like a warped locust pushes its way through the gap and begins to fly around. Then it's followed by another. And another.

A second crack appears, unleashing another string of insects into the air around you, so you pick up your pace to get away from them. But they keep coming, and new cracks are opening along the entire hallway.

Soon, you can't avoid the bugs, and you're constantly swatting them away from you to keep them from landing on your body. But they aren't deterred, and keep coming to try to cover you. 

Eventually, one bites you on the back of your neck, drawing a small amount of blood and that seems to drive the swarm into a frenzy. They bite and scrape your skin and no matter how much you push them away, more come to fill in their place.

They're eating you alive! You can't help but scream and fall to the ground to try and protect yourself and prolong your life as long as you can.

But suddenly, they're all gone? You suppose it wasn't real, but an experience like that isn't easy to shake off.
<<elseif $temp == "slime">>\
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/slimehallucination.png']]

A wet, gurgling sound grabs you attention from beyond the next turn in your path. Khemia has spotted it too and he's gripping the handle of his sword tightly. 

After a moment of anticipation, a pair of creatures that vaguely resemble grotesque women made of green slime turn the corner and head towards you and Khemia.

Khemia draws his weapon and attempts to fight the creatures, but each of his strikes passes through, harmlessly. And with each strike, his weapon becomes more degraded, as the acidic slime eats away at the materials and the face of the creature becomes a twisted grin. 

<<say $companionKhemia>>No! It won't end like this!<</say>>
Khemia sounds panicked, but manages to keep fighting, no matter how futile it seems. 

Meanwhile, the second creature grips your arm, and as you pull away, you find that despite the appearance of a soft slime, you're held tightly in place. The creature gurgles once again and you feel her touch you. The clothes on your arm are burned away and you scream when you feel her do the same to your skin.

<<say $companionKhemia>>No! I can beat you!<</say>>
You hear Khemia fighting, but when you turns towards you after your scream, the creature fighting him grabs him too.

<<say $companionKhemia>>AAAAAHHHHHH!<</say>>
He's crying out in pain, an imitation of your own, as the slime creatures engulf more of each of you, burning all of the nerves in both of your bodies, you collapse from the pain, fading into certain death.


...Then you wake up, completely unharmed. Khemia is sitting down, a puddle of vomit in front of him and his fists balled tight. He breathes heavily, but tries to calm himself when he sees you're awake.

<<say $companionKhemia>>It wasn't real. I didn't expect something like that... It felt so real. But we're safe. We can keep going... even if it means facing that again.<</say>>
He's obviously shaken, but he seems willing to move forward. You should probably follow his lead and get back to traveling after losing so much time to that illusion.
<<elseif $temp == "desperation">>\
As you wander through the bright halls of the layer, you hear a surprised yell from your companion, Cloud.

<<say $companionCloud>>Are you ok? How did you get down here?<</say>>
He isn't talking to you, and when you turn to face him, you see him offering a hand to an emaciated woman who seems to be weeping. 

<<say $rndF>>Please, help me! I can't take it any more!<</say>>
She cries out and try to grip him more tightly, causing him to stumble, but he manages to keep his balance.

<<say $companionCloud>>Don't worry, we'll take care of you. Do you need help getting back to the surface? That would take quite a while, but I think we could try to take you with us on our journey.<</say>>
<<say $rndF>>No! Why can't you help me? I never did anything wrong...<</say>>
The woman grips her head and screams, causing Cloud to visibly flinch and recoil from her, even as he makes an effort to stay calm for her. Then another door opens in the hallway an elderly man with sunken eyes and a long beard staggers out. His clothes are ragged and it looks like he's on the verge of starvation.

<<say $rndM>>Food... I need something, please!<</say>>
The man seems to go into a frenzy at first, but his body barely responds and he limps towards you, intent on some sort of confrontation. The woman screeches again, one hand holding her head and the other holding Cloud in place, but this time he pulls away from her.

<<say $companionCloud>>I don't... I don't think this is real. We can't help them.<</say>>
He seems like he's talking to himself more than you, as if convincing himself it's okay to leave these people here. But his thoughts are interrupted by more doors opening along the hallway and more people calling out. 

<<say $rndF>>Has anyone seen my daughter? She can't survive without me!<</say>>
<<say $rndM>>Please, I can't take it here any more, you need to take me with you. You can't just abandon me!<</say>>
<<say $rndF>>Water... I just need one sip of water. I can't even feel my lips any more... I'm so tired.<</say>>
The voices reach a discordant cacophony of desperation, with no relief in sight. But some of the people charge at your and your companions, forcing you to fight them off. They respond just like normal, weak, desperate humans. Each blow feels like you're hurting someone who just wanted help.

But these can't be real people, there's no way they could have survived down here, right? And even if they were, it's self-defense...

Eventually, you're surrounded by people, many collapsed and moaning in pain on the ground, and others aren't moving at all, as if their body had given out in their final assault against you. You spot Cloud as he kneels down at the body of one apparently unmoving woman. He seems to whisper something to her, but you can't make out the words.

Then suddenly, everything is gone, you're once again in an empty, white hallway, on pace to continue your journey. When Cloud looks back at you, tears are running down his face.

<<say $companionCloud>>I guess it wasn't real after all. We should probably get moving then.<</say>>
But this event isn't easy to forget. And based on the look on Cloud's face, it's made a deep impression on him as well.
<<elseif $temp == "rot">>\
[img[setup.ImagePath+'Threats/rothallucination.png']]

As you walk through the hallways of the layer, a stain appears in the unnaturally pristine walls that surround you. A black spot that seems like a bit of mold growing on bread, except it's on the solid stone.

On second glance, it seems to be growing, expanding outward at an alarming pace, threatening to cover the shining walls and coat them in a tainted residue. But as it grows, it also sprouts small structures, like mushrooms, and they seem to be releasing a foul-smelling powder of some sort.

Then you hear a scream.

<<say $companionCherry>>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!<</say>>
Cherry's voice is louder than you've heard before, a shocking contrast to her typical silence. But you immediately spot the cause of her panic, she's holding up her arm and a similar black spot has appeared on it, just like the one on the wall. 

<<say $companionCherry>>Get it off me!<</say>>
She's frantically scraping the skin on her arm, to no avail, as the spot ignores her violent protests and starts to spread across her skin.

<<say $companionCherry>>Help me, $mc.name! Help me!<</say>>
She's calling out to you, and you see her arm has nearly entirely blackened. She's struggling to hold it up now, as if it were a dead weight attached to her torso.

But then you also spot a prickling sensation on your own arm, and spot a black spot on you too. The prickling becomes ore intense, and you can feel the dark spot growing on you and into you, as if it's consuming your arm from the inside. It seems impossible you can dig it out at this point. 

Instinctively, you try to dig at it and tear it off, but it's more than skin deep now, its tendrils are growing into you and the soon your arm feels nothing at all, as if it were a foreign growth attached to your body. 

And it keeps spreading, never stopping or slowing, as you slowly lose control of your limbs and collapse onto the ground. You manage to spot Cherry weeping, the black rot finally creeping towards her head, her tears are becoming tinged with black dust. 

It consumes you, leaving nothing of you left but a corpse to fester and provide a source of food for further growth. 

Not a person. 

Not even a body. 

Just a thing.

You close your eyes for the last time.


...Then you open them again. And everything is back to normal, or as normal as things can get this deep in the Abyss. You look down at yourself and see no hints of the horror you just experienced, meaning it must have been an illusion, right?

Cherry is curled in a ball, taking shallow gasps and staring at her shaking hands. It takes her a few minutes to even respond to you as you try to calm her down.

<<say $companionCherry>>Why? Why did this happen to me?<</say>>
Her voice is quiet, but she manages to get back to her typically somber self eventually. Unfortunately, this isn't something that you can forget easily, but you'll have to try to so you can complete the expedition.
<<else>>
There is neither day nor night on this layer of the Abyss, you're not even certain that time is actually passing based on how much physics is breaking down here. But you certainly still experience time subjectively, and everyone needs to rest sometimes.

Today, as you are dozing, darkness creeps in around you. Stillness, silence, darkness. A chill runs along your skin, and you wake with a start. Darkness. Your lights do nothing to penetrate it. You think you hear a faint scraping of something out there, in the dark.

Your pulse skyrockets and your skin is covered in goosebumps. 

You can't see, and there's something out there.

Something absolutely terrifying.

You can't help but hold your breath, until you need to breathe again. The atmosphere is normal, yet suffocating.

Finally, after what feels like an eternity in the darkness, the shadow passes and the strange sourceless light of this layer returns to light up the disconcerting surroundings. You shake yourself, and find you were already standing up, were you dreaming and sleep walking? Were you hallucinating?

You're not sure. Still, that sound in the dark... some part of you can't completely calm down. You've got a feeling deep in your gut that there truly is something out there, something very bad, something that was looking right at you.

Shadows seem to flow from invisible cracks in the perfect white walls and creep around you. Then a deep, unnatural chill settles into your bones.

There is undoubtedly something out there, in this thick darkness. The air feels heavy with the weight of the shadows.

The atmosphere is oppressive, as if it is squeezing you tightly around your whole body. But this isn't an illusion, you feel real pressure as the darkness squeezes you, gripping your flesh and attempting you rend you.

This time, you need to fight back, or you risk being torn apart by the shadows.

Silently, small arachnid shapes emerge from the walls, leaving trails of sticky silk in their wake. Their webs block out your escape, they advance on you. 

They jump, and skitter. They drop and swing on strands of webbing, legs flailing to try to find purchase on you.

Through the swarm, eight shiny eyes of enormous proportion emerge. A spider that shouldn't exist, one that didn't evolve for hunting flies, but perhaps deer, or bears... or humans.

Behind the tightening veil of the brood it lurks, fangs twitching, legs tensing as it moves adeptly through the webs that surround you.

A group of shadowy, canine forms approach you, and the walls seem to recede to give them room to circle you ominously. Their fur is dark and eyes are bright yellow, and each of them is the size of a small lion.

The pack of wolves stalk you, barring their gleaming teeth in preparation for the attack.

A familiar serpentine hissing seems to appear from all around you, a chorus of slithering threats.

Then you spot them emerging, crawling out of invisible holes in the walls. The slide and slither over each other as the swarm surrounds you. Some lay low, but others bar their fangs and hiss, a clear poison dripping copiously from the vicious instruments.

The circle tightens, you only have a few moments to think before they are upon you. 

How will you overcome these serpents?

You hear a clicking, chittering sound coming from one of the walls of the twisting hallway you're walking down, but when you look, nothing seems amiss.

But it doesn't take long for the Abyss to correct that misconception, as bugs begin to emerge from hidden crevices in the walls and from around corners in the hallway.

They swarm densely, as if consciously building their strength before they attack you. They only leave you a few moment to plan your defenses.

How will you defeat these insects?

A wet sloshing sound approaches rapidly from down a staircase in front of you, filling the hallway with a viscous slime. 

You manage to jump quickly to some higher ground, but the level of the slime keeps rising. Khemia yelps when a bit of the slime splashes against some of his exposed skin and leaves a distinct burn mark.

The slime keeps rising, and you have nowhere to go. 

But suddenly, you spot it, a door that leads to another staircase going up, about 30 meters away. If you can make it there, then you should be able to escape they slime and survive.

With the caustic threat approaching, how do you plan to survive?

A person seems to yelp from around a corner and both you and Cloud turn to hear their voice.

<<say $rndF>>How did I get here? Where did my kitchen go?<</say>>
It's an emaciated woman, she seems to panicking. She looks over at you and begins to shake uncontrollably and scream.

<<say $rndF>>Monsters! Stay away! I won't let you take me! I WON'T!<</say>>
She looks around frantically, then seems to pull out a large kitchen knife. 

From around a corner a strange man seems to look at the woman, but then he spots you and his eyes go wide. He shakes fearfully as he holds a carpenters sledgehammer and begins to approach you. 

New people are coming from every direction, there doesn't seem to be any way to run unless you fight your way through a mob. Cloud looks to you with clear concern in his eyes. This is one of the only times you've seen him so uncertain and so... afraid.

How will you deal with these people?

You spot a black mushroom extending its mycelium onto the ground and into the wall. You turn around to avoid it, but when you turn, you find yourself facing a new hallway filled with the vile-looking fungi. 

The mushroom appears to cough and begins to spew a fine black dust into the air, but instinctively you know that it wouldn't be a good idea to breathe that in. 

Cherry blinks rapidly at the sight of the fungus and holds a shaking hand up to her face, as if expecting herself to disappear, but she's still there for now.

How will you get past this toxic rot without breathing it in?

You can't outrun it, you can't defend against it. There's nowhere to hide. Whatever is out there in the darkness, this time it comes for you.

You don't know what it is that slashes and tears through the flesh on your side. You don't have time to respond though. Your nerves go haywire as something grips the back of your head and slams you face first into the ground, with a shocking brutality.

If it wasn't already completely dark, everything would have gone black. Through the pain and the fear, you can feel your consciousness fading.

.......

You wake up, but you're not in good shape.

You're bleeding, pretty badly.

You think you can survive this, but you really need some medical attention. Your next 5 travel times are increased by 4 days each and you are now threatened by death if another threat were to defeat you.
<<elseif $temp == "spiders">>
You have fought long and hard to get here, but nothing you've done, nothing you know, nothing you possess, can stop this thing.

The venom of the smaller spiders is getting to you, but you try to run anyway, in spite of the burning.

You are too slow, far too slow. The towering spider is on you in a flash, striking fangs deep into your shoulder, then withdrawing.

You feebly try to strike at it, but it's out of range far before you can manage it. You stumble forward, and it stalks you, staying out of range, waiting for the venom to take greater effect as it dissolves your flesh inside the wound.

Then you must have given it an opening, because it's on you again, sinking its fangs into your leg.

Your vision blurs, and you collapse, but you're filled with absolute terror as you realize you can no longer move your muscles.

The hulking spider begins draping webbing over you. Its 8 jagged legs scrape against you, but you can do nothing.

It bundles you up, and then you feel its fangs in your neck.

Through the pain and the fear, you feel yourself fading.

You pass out.


........

You awaken. You don't know what happened, but the webbing is gone, you're free.

You're in terrible shape though. Blood still oozes from some of the many punctures over your body and you have a hard time moving any of your muscles.

Your head swims with what feels like some vile poison.

You vomit, and as you get up, you're unsteady on your feet.

You think you can probably survive this, but you seriously need some medical attention. All future travel times are increased by 7 days unless you get medical treatment and you are now threatened by death if another threat were to defeat you.
<<elseif $temp == "wolves">>
Try though you might, you don't have what it takes to overcome this pack of Abyssal wolves.

You're hyperventilating, sweating, screaming in futility as they wear you down and start taking landing bites.

Their jaws rip at your legs and drag you down. Your arms are ravaged by fangs, and any defenses you have are knocked away.

Your air is cut off, and blood starts running down your neck from powerful jaws. You can feel them start to rip, and you pass out.


........

Somehow, you wake up. You're covered in your own blood. Isn't that supposed to be inside you instead of outside of you?

Fang punctures and tears are all over you. It's some kind of miracle that you haven't died.

Where did the wolves go? They had you. You don't understand.

You're grievously wounded though. You're going to need medical attention. All future travel times are increased by 7 days unless you get medical treatment and you are now threatened by death if another threat were to defeat you.
<<elseif $temp == "snakes">>
One of the snakes bites your ankles and you instinctively yelp in pain as you pull away. 

But the toxin acts quickly and you are barely able to move. Another snake slithers over around you paralyzed limb, squeezing you gently as it slides up your body.

You almost hyperventilate as the creatures follow suit and swarm over you. And you feel a few more pricks across your body, leaving you entirely unable to move as the snakes cover your vision and swarm across you for untold hours.

But eventually, the swarm leaves, and you find yourself still alive. You're barely able to move, the venom had lingering paralytic effects. All future travel times are increased by 7 days unless you get medical treatment and you are now threatened by death if another threat were to defeat you.
<<elseif $temp == "insects">>
You try to swat the swarm away from you, but they just keep coming.

You crush one in your hands and another replaces it in an instant. 

None of your attacks make any impact, they only delay the inevitable.

When you can't keep them off you any more they start biting and scratching, leaving you bloody. You can only hope they aren't leaving their eggs and maggots to grow inside of you. You really don't want to think of that. 

But fortunately, before you feel they can devour all of your flesh, they leave you.

You cough, and a small locust emerges from your throat, prompting you to vomit. But you're safe, for now.

The swarm's attack has left you seriously injured. Your next 5 travel times are increased by 4 days each and you are now threatened by death if another threat were to defeat you.
<<elseif $temp == "slime">>
You simply dive into the slime and make a break for the escape staircase. Khemia yells something after you angrily, but you can't make out his words.

The moment you touch the slime, you scream as it burns you and eats away at your flesh. 

It almost feels alive. Like the slime is trying to worm its way into your body and consume you from the inside.

You can't do anything but keep pushing forward. 

And finally, you push through the pain and manage to reach the safety of the stairs. You can hear yourself screaming as you make your way up towards safety.

Fortunately, you haven't suffered any fatal injuries, but you do have chemical burns all over your body. Your next 5 travel times are increased by 4 days each and you are now threatened by death if another threat were to defeat you.
<<elseif $temp == "desperation">>
You try to fight off the people without injuring them, but they prove to be too much for you. 

Despite each one being weak, the crowd just keeps coming relentlessly, overcoming their obvious fear to come together and attack your party. 

Eventually, you end up with many cuts and some broken bones before the crowd decides that you've been defeated. 

They head off into one of the side passages, but you can still hear whispered worries and confusion. They speak about returning home and escaping. They wonder where they are.

But you can't answer their questions.

Fortunately, you're able to mostly recover when they're gone. You are injured though, so your next 4 travel times are increased by 3 days each and you are now threatened by death if another threat were to defeat you.
<<elseif $temp == "rot">>
You don't have any adequate countermeasures, so you simply decide to walk through the ominous hallway filled with fungus and rot. You can filter your breath through a cloth and try to move quickly, but those measures are clearly inadequate.

Despite your best efforts, you can't help but breathe in some of the spores.

You cough involuntarily, and you can't stop coughing. Cherry tries to comfort you, but she's coughing too.

The coughs become more violent, until eventually you make it through the passageway and safely away from the fungus. But at this point your coughs are tinted red.

You feel weaker, like something is eating away at you from the inside. All future travel times are increased by 7 days unless you get medical treatment and you are now threatened by death if another threat were to defeat you.

You can't really feel anything anyway.

You might as well just take a rest.

Close your eyes.

Go to sleep.

Good night.

Be at peace.
<<else>>
You can't outrun it, you can't defend against it. There's nowhere to hide. Whatever is out there in the darkness, this time it comes for you.

You don't know what it is that slashes and tears through the flesh on your side. You don't have time to respond though. Your nerves go haywire as something grips the back of your head and slams you face first into the ground, with a shocking brutality.

A horrible hissing and rasping sound echoes in your ears and your vision goes red, a stark contrast to the darkness surrounding you.

You were already wounded, and now your body gives out.

You feel something slide across your throat, and you die.

All stories end. Today, down in this strange place where reality has been torn to tatters, you met your end.

Be at peace.

:: Layer 8 Threat 2b Victory

<<if $temp == "" || $temp == "darkness">>
After using your weapon on your umbral foe, a shriek emerges from the inky blackness, and light returns to the room you were in. A frail shadow crumples to the ground, then folds in on itself, bending in unnatural ways and screeching.

Eventually it shrinks beyond your view, apparently faded away into nothing.

Whatever it was, you're sure you've defeated it, but it was merely a single threat this layer. You are certain that there are more things like that lurking here, just out of sight.
<<elseif $temp == "spiders">>
Harnessing the power of your weapons, you turn their combined might on the fell spider and fight for your life.

Eventually, a quiet hissing squealing sound comes from the direction of your foe, along with frantic clicking.

The webbing around you disappears, the smaller spiders quiver in place and vanish.

The clicking grows slower and softer. The enormous spider seems to dwindle in size. It has rolled over on its back, its legs twitching.

It seems to shrink further, and you approach in horrified curiosity. It... isn't really a spider. Whatever it is though, it's clearly dying.

With a few final twitches, its diminishing legs seem to just dissolve, along with the carapace and its innards.

You are victorious, but you feel a bit unsettled by the whole experience. What was that thing?

What other strange creatures lurk down here?
<<elseif $temp == "wolves">>
Harnessing the power of your weapons, you lash out at the wolfpack, grievously wounding the largest among them.

Under the ferocity of your attack, the other wolves let out yipping whines as they retreat, and then fade out of existence.

The wolf you wounded though, its blood runs red in the snow, but then starts fading. The snow fades away, the blood turns clear.

You look on quizzically at the... thing. It has taken on the shape of a wolf, but... it's not truly a wolf.

You suspect you've dealt it a mortal wound though.

You lash out once again, and all movement stops. The corpse that had the shape of a wolf just evaporates.

What a strange place this is. What strange things inhabit it?
<<elseif $temp == "snakes">>
You manage to keep the snakes back and the swarm begins to thin out. 

Minute by minute, less and less of the snakes remain. Until finally, the last one is defeated.

Suddenly, their corpses seem to melt and give way to some dark viscous substance, which itself seems to meld with the surrounding architecture, leaving no remnants of the enemy you faced here.

What was that, truly? Was it real or only another dream. Fortunately you defeated it this time, so you do not have to find out.
<<elseif $temp == "insects">>
You use your weapons to push back the swarm, keeping them away from you as you think their numbers. 

It takes quite a while, but you manage to ward them off long enough for the swarm to disperse, it seems the threat is finally fading. 

There are surprisingly few insect corpses for how much fighting you've done, but it doesn't matter now. You just want to move on and to rest.
<<elseif $temp == "slime">>
You use your tools deftly to escape the oncoming caustic tide, ensuring you can safety reach your destination without any harm.

The slime keeps rising, but you can follow the staircase upwards. Further and further until the slime is far above your head, apparently stuck to the ceiling? Regardless, you're safe now and can continue your journey.
<<elseif $temp == "desperation">>
You manage to defeat or escape from the the crowd, then you run until they are far behind you and their voices fade from your ears.

<<say $companionCloud>>I hurt one of them... I hurt them and they bled and they called out for help. But no one came to save them. I thought it was an illusion, but that was real flesh, real blood that I spilled... I think they were innocent.<</say>>
Cloud has his fists balled tightly to his side as he mutters to himself. But he tries to calm down and places his hands over his eyes for a few moments. 

When he removes them, he's smiling again. It's his usual charming smile, but it seems more sad now, somehow. And you spot the wet trails running down from his eyes despite the appearance of a confident smile.

<<say $companionCloud>>Sorry about that. There's no way that could be real. There's no need to worry yourself about it. We shouldn't let that stop us from continuing our journey.<</say>>
His smile falters, but holds as he insists that everything is fine. Eventually you move on, but a part of you still wonders about the people you saw earlier...
<<elseif $temp == "rot">>
You manage to make your way through the perilous rotten hallway, and once you're a safe distance away from it, you take a breath of clean, fresh air. Or at least as fresh as it can get down in this dimensional hell.

Cherry's hands are shaking, but she's quiet. She doesn't say anything when you try to speak to her at first, but after a few tries she gives you a small smile and speaks.

<<say $companionCherry>>It's ok, $mc.name. We beat it... So maybe I can beat it too...<</say>>
Her voice is quiet, but it seems like she's come out better for having faced her fear and made it through safely. Perhaps not everything you experience down here is horrible.

You wait as your balloon rapidly ascends and you can watch the metallic buildings shrink beneath you. Swarms of robots seems to pursue their mysterious duties as if they were ants scurrying about an anthill. Luckily they don't seem to pay much attention to the air, and even the occasional flying robot pays you no notice as you ascend towards the gate to the sixth layer.
